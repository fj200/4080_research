"1526910","<p>I have a custom table cell which contains a number of UILabels. At runtime, I am adjusting the height of the labels to fit their contents using <code>sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize:lineBreakMode:</code> and repositioning them accordingly. The last label in the cell contains a large amount of text, causing it to wrap, and I'm having a very odd problem. Although the <code>sizeWithFont</code> call returns the correct size, and I'm setting the UILabel's frame to that height, it draws a couple of lines short. This screenshot illustrates what I'm talking about:</p>

<p><img src=""https://content.screencast.com/users/MrTact/folders/Jing/media/e040f4ec-be5c-432a-888a-b438f84ce8f5/00000003.png"" alt=""Screenshot of UILabel problem""></p>

<p>In this example, the height of the full block of text should be 90 (as checked in Interface Builder), and that's what returns from <code>sizeWithFont</code>. It's also the height that the UILabel's frame is set to, which I have verified by logging and also by stopping execution and inspecting the value. However, as you can see, it's clearly <strong>not</strong> drawing the full 90 pixels high, although it's correctly allocating the space for it (the thin black line above 'Edited' is the table cell border). I'm completely perplexed. If anyone can offer some insight as to why it's behaving this way, I would be very grateful.</p>

<p>Turns out that the cell does layout twice -- once during heightForRowAtIndexPath, which is where I tweak all the heights of the subviews and the cell, and later during some untraceable transaction originating in __CFRunLoopDoObservers. How did I trace this? I added a layoutSubviews override to my custom table view cell class so I could breakpoint it.</p>

<p>During the second pass, the last UILabel subview was getting set to a shorter height than I set it to, probably in accordance with some arcane autoresizing rules. (Yes, I tried tweaking all of those settings first, with no success.) As it turns out, merely doing nothing in layoutSubviews disabled this framework behavior, allowing me to completely control how my views draw.</p>

"1527907","<p>I am looking to make a custom window which would look something like this (never mind the quick photoshop):</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/j4glz.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/j4glz.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></a></p>

<p>The main problem I have is not to make the window transparent (although I guess any info is welcome!), but that I want to be able to click only on the visible part of the buttons. For example, if I click just outside the top left of the &quot;5&quot; button, I want it to register a click on the &quot;1&quot; button and not the &quot;5&quot; button, even though I clicked in button 5's bounding box. And if I click just ouside of the &quot;1&quot; button's top left &quot;corner&quot;, I want it to click on whatever is beneath my window and not on the button. I also need to be able to resize this window and the pictures in the buttons should resize with them.</p>
<p>I was thinking of using a transparent NSWindow with transparent NSButtons containing PNGs with alpha for each button but I think the overlapping buttons will be a problem.</p>
<p>I have also heard about applications like Bowtie, SweetFM and others using WebKit to display their interfaces. If that is a possibility on at least 10.3 that would be interesting, but I don't know how that would work either.</p>
<p>I looked around for click masks, areas or something like that but I haven't found anything yet. I will update this post as I find more info (if I do!).</p>
<p>Any hints on how to proceed?</p>
<p>(Note that I am working on 10.4 and <em>ideally</em> I need to support some older versions of Mac OS X too.)</p>
<p>(Also, I found the &quot;rounded window&quot; example on Apple's dev. site but it doesn't run on 10.4 anymore so I'm not sure this is the way to go.)</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<h1>UPDATE:</h1>
<p><em>(see update 2, this problem is fixed now)</em></p>
<p>OK now I'm having a slightly different (but not unrelated) issue. What I did so far is this:</p>
<p>I opted for making a custom control that I'll be able to use for each of my buttons:</p>
<p>1- Subclass NSControl and override drawRect, mouseUp, mouseDragged and mouseDown. This way I can get the behavior I want when dragging on a button (move the window).</p>
<p>2- Load images for each button states (same shape but one is darkened) into NSImages and draw them into the view using <code>compositeToPoint:fromRect:operation:</code> when necessary. The images are <strong>185 x 185</strong> pixels <strong>PNG files with alpha</strong> exported from Photoshop.</p>
<p>3- Get the NSImage's bitmap representation:</p>
<pre><code>NSBitmapImageRep *bitRep = [[NSBitmapImageRep imageRepWithData:[unpressedImage TIFFRepresentation]] retain];
</code></pre>
<p><em>OR</em></p>
<pre><code>NSBitmapImageRep *bitRep = [[unpressedImage representations] objectAtIndex:0];
</code></pre>
<p>Both seem to give the same result. I tried compositing this bitmap rep onto my window to see if the image has same size and look as the original and all seems good (you'll see why I did that after this enumeration...).</p>
<p>4- In the mouse event methods, I use the bitmap representation to get the alpha component for a particular point:</p>
<pre><code>NSPoint mouse = [self convertPoint:[theEvent locationInWindow] fromView:nil]; // Returns the correct x and y positions on the control (i.e: between 0 and 185 for each axis).

NSColor *colorUnderMouse = [[[unpressedImage representations] objectAtIndex:0] colorAtX:mouse.x y:mouse.y];
float alpha = [colorUnderMouse alphaComponent];
</code></pre>
<p>Then I print the alpha value to the console but I am getting very weird results. Getting the alpha component and the color under the mouse seems to work at first glance (the colors and alpha returned are in my bitmap) but it looks like the color is not taken at the right point in the <code>bitRep</code>, or the image contained in the <code>bitRep</code> is distorted (it isn't distorted when I composite the <code>bitRep</code> on the window though, which is very strange). Again I double-checked the x and y mouse coordinates were in the (0,185) range and that the size of the <code>NSBitmapImageRep</code> is 185 x 185 too.</p>
<p>First it looks like the <code>NSBitmapImageRep</code> is flipped horizontally compared to my <code>NSImage</code>. If I flip my coordinates the values returned seem mostly OK (most of the shape seems to fit with the values returned) but there are still parts of the image which return wrong values.</p>
<p>I'm clueless at this point and having never worked with <code>NSBitmapImageRep</code> before maybe I just forgot to specify some format information about my image which would be why the values are off. Could someone clarify this please?</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
<h1>UPDATE 2:</h1>
<p>Ok never mind, I found the issue. I used the setColor:atX:y: method to draw a colored dot on the bitRep before printing it on my window and the issue was clear as day: the Y coordinate is reversed in the bitRep, but the image is printed with the &quot;good&quot; orientation. This means that the bitRep has &quot;Windows-style&quot; top-left origin coordinate system while the window has the cartesian coordinate system (bottom-left) origin. Simply reversing my Y coordinate fixed the issues I had getting the alpha component and color.</p>
<p>This must have been written somewhere in the docs, sorry to have bothered you because of my lack of research...!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I want to build a console app, that is normally run from the command line. </p>

<p>But, when it is double clicked from within Explorer (as opposed to being run from a cmd.exe prompt) then I'd like the program to NOT display a console window. </p>

<p>I want to avoid this: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/vPkpr.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/vPkpr.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>Is it possible?  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I guess another way to ask it is, <em>is it possible for a program to know how it was invoked - whether by double-click or by command line</em> ? </p>

<p>I'm working in .NET, on Windows. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> From <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/01/9259142.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">this <em>Old New Thing</em> blog post</a> I learned some good stuff.  Here's what I know now...</p>

<p>In Windows, EXE files are marked as either GUI or non-GUI. With csc.exe, this is selected with <code>/target:winexe</code> or <code>/target:exe</code>. Before the first instruction in the process executes, the Windows kernel sets up the execution environment. At that moment, if the EXE is marked GUI, the kernel sets the stdin/stdout for the process to NULL, and if non-GUI (command-line) the kernel creates a console and sets the stdin/stdout for the process to that console. </p>

<p>When launching the process, if there is no stdin/stdout (== <code>/target:winexe</code>), then the call immediately returns.  So, launching a gui app from a cmd.exe, you will immediately get your cmd prompt back.  If there is a stdin/stdout, and if run from cmd.exe, then the parent cmd.exe waits for process exit. </p>

<p>The ""immediate return"" is important because if you code a GUI app to attach to its parent's console, you will be able to do console.writeline, etc.  But the cmd.exe prompt is active. The user can type new commands, start a new process, and so on.  In other words, from a winexe, simply attaching to the parent console with <code>AttachConsole(-1)</code> will not ""turn it into"" a console app.  </p>

<hr>

<p>At this point I think the only way to allow an app to use the console if it is invoked from cmd.exe, and NOT use it if it is double-clicked, is to define the exe as a regular console exe (<code>/target:exe</code>), and <em>hide the window</em> on startup if appropriate.  You still get a console window appearing briefly.  </p>

<p>I still haven't figured how to know whether it was launched from explorer or cmd.exe, but I'm getting closer..   </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>ANSWERS</strong></p>

<p>It is not possible to build a console app that does not display a console window. </p>

<p>It <em>is possible</em> to build a console app that hides its window very quickly, but not so quickly that it is as if the window never appears. </p>

<p>Now, to determine whether a console app was launched from explorer, some have suggested to look at the console it is running in<br>
(from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1528152/is-it-possible-to-build-a-console-app-that-does-not-display-a-console-window-when/1528271#1528271"">mgb's answer</a>,  and <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/99115"" rel=""noreferrer"">KB article 99115</a>)  :</p>

<pre><code>  int left = Console.CursorLeft;
  int top = Console.CursorTop;
  bool ProcessWasRunFromExplorer = (left==0 &amp;&amp; top==0);
</code></pre>

<p>This tells you if the process was launched in its own console, but not whether it was explorer.  A double click in explorer would do this, but also a Start.Process() from within an app would do the same thing. </p>

<p>If you want to treat those situations differently, use this to learn the name of the parent process:</p>

<pre><code>  System.Console.WriteLine(""Process id: {0}"", Process.GetCurrentProcess().Id);
  string name = Process.GetCurrentProcess().ProcessName ;
  System.Console.WriteLine(""Process name: {0}"", name);
  PerformanceCounter pc = new PerformanceCounter(""Process"", ""Creating Process Id"", name);
  Process p = Process.GetProcessById((int)pc.RawValue);
  System.Console.WriteLine(""Parent Process id: {0}"", p.Id);
  System.Console.WriteLine(""Parent Process name: {0}"", p.ProcessName);

  // p.ProcessName == ""cmd"" or ""Explorer"" etc
</code></pre>

<p>To hide the window quickly after the process is launched, use this: </p>

<pre><code>  private static readonly int SW_HIDE= 0;

  [System.Runtime.InteropServices.DllImport(""user32.dll"")]
  private static extern Boolean ShowWindow(IntPtr hWnd, Int32 nCmdShow);

  ....
  {
    IntPtr myHandle = Process.GetCurrentProcess().MainWindowHandle;
    ShowWindow(myHandle, SW_HIDE);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>If you produce a <code>winexe</code> (a WinForms app), and optionally attach to the parent console when appropriate with <code>AttachConsole(-1)</code>, you do not get the equivalent of a regular console app. For a winexe, the parent process (like cmd.exe) will return to the command prompt immediately after starting a GUI application. In other words, the command prompt is active and ready for input while the just-launched process may be emitting output. This is confusing and is probably useful only for debugging winforms apps. </p>

<p>This worked for me. </p>

(You can find the C# definition of that message on <a href=""http://pinvoke.net"" rel=""noreferrer"">PInvoke.net</a>) In particular, when you receive the message, calculate if the hit test is for a point in the region you've designated for resize and if it is, return HTBOTTOMRIGHT. The default window proc will do the rest for you, as it will assume that the user has clicked on the bottom right corner of the window border, even though your window has no border.</p>

<p>This aproach requires a teensy bit of Win32 interop, but it'll make your resize look exactly like any other window resize.</p>

<p>The easy way would be to do as @benPearce said and put a panel in the corner and adjust the form size using Width/Height. It's going to work, but the resize is not going to be smooth, especially on Vista and Win7 Basic, where full redraw is disabled on standard move and resize, while is going to attempt redraw on every step.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: In both approaches you will have to figure out also how to paint the gripper. You can put a bitmap of the standard gripper, for example. Though, given that your form has no title and border so you are not necessarily stuck with the standard Windows visuals, you might opt in for something snazzier.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: If you have a control that covers the whole window, it will eat the form mouse messages. You have to somehow clip the place you want to use for resizing out of that control. You have several options to deal with this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Resize the control to make some space for the resizing grip.</li>
<li>Tweak the control region (throug the Region property) to exclude the resizing grip.</li>
<li>Cover the resizing grip a panel, listen to its MouseEnter message and set the form Capture property to true, which will cause all further mouse messages to go to it. <strong>Note</strong>: you will have to release the capture once the mouse leaves that region after the resize is finished.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would recommend to go for option 1 as the simplest. Option 3 is the most complex and would require intimate details on how mouse input works in Windows, so I wouldn't recommend it. Option 2 is a good alternative to option 1, but you'll have to give it a try to see how the ListView control would react to its region being tweaked.</p>

<p>This code is retrieving the row number from the selected row in a component. Arrays are zero indexed and the pickerview (probably) uses array's to manage the rows. So, the first row will be 0, the second 1, the third 2 and so on. This is easily solved by doing:</p>

"1550878","<p>I am trying to write my own function for scaling up an input image by using the Nearest-neighbor interpolation algorithm. The bad part is I am able to see how it works but cannot find the algorithm itself. I will be grateful for any help.</p>

","Nearest-neighbor interpolation algorithm in MATLAB","<matlab><image-processing><interpolation><nearest-neighbor><resize-image>","2009-10-11 14:53:56","60456","1551208","4","<p>A while back I went through the code of the <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imresize.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>imresize</code></a> function in the <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/products/image.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MATLAB Image Processing Toolbox</a> to create a simplified version for just nearest neighbor interpolation of images. Here's how it would be applied to your problem:</p>

<pre><code>%# Initializations:

scale = [2 2];              %# The resolution scale factors: [rows columns]
oldSize = size(inputImage);                   %# Get the size of your image

%# Compute an upsampled set of indices:

rowIndex = min(round(((1:newSize(1))-0.5)./scale(1)+0.5),oldSize(1));
colIndex = min(round(((1:newSize(2))-0.5)./scale(2)+0.5),oldSize(2));

%# Index old image to get new image:

outputImage = inputImage(rowIndex,colIndex,:);
</code></pre>

<p>Another option would be to use the built-in <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/interp2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>interp2</code></a> function, although you mentioned not wanting to use built-in functions in one of your comments.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: EXPLANATION</strong></p>

<p>In case anyone is interested, I thought I'd explain how the solution above works...</p>

<pre><code>newSize = max(floor(scale.*oldSize(1:2)),1);
</code></pre>

<p>First, to get the new row and column sizes the old row and column sizes are multiplied by the scale factor. This result is rounded down to the nearest integer with <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/floor.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>floor</code></a>. If the scale factor is less than 1 you could end up with a weird case of one of the size values being 0, which is why the call to <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/max.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>max</code></a> is there to replace anything less than 1 with 1.</p>

<pre><code>rowIndex = min(round(((1:newSize(1))-0.5)./scale(1)+0.5),oldSize(1));
colIndex = min(round(((1:newSize(2))-0.5)./scale(2)+0.5),oldSize(2));
</code></pre>

<p>Next, a new set of indices is computed for both the rows and columns. First, a set of indices for the upsampled image is computed: <code>1:newSize(...)</code>. Each image pixel is considered as having a given width, such that pixel 1 spans from 0 to 1, pixel 2 spans from 1 to 2, etc.. The ""coordinate"" of the pixel is thus treated as the center, which is why 0.5 is subtracted from the indices. These coordinates are then divided by the scale factor to give a set of pixel-center coordinates for the original image, which then have 0.5 added to them and are rounded off to get a set of integer indices for the original image. The call to <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/min.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>min</code></a> ensures that none of these indices are larger than the original image size <code>oldSize(...)</code>.</p>

<p>To move/rotate/scale just multiply each vector by the transformation matrix.</p>

  <p>create all rectangles centered at origin (0,0,0), then rotate them as needed and move to desired position.

","c#.net ListView - pull different information back from different tables","<c#><asp.net><data-binding><listview>","2009-10-12 14:39:44","2103","1581556","3","<p>Here's how I tend to solve problems like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>manually pull our the data you want to show (calling the repository methods, not using ObjectDataSource to do it). For efficiency, it often makes sense to make one big query which returns denormalized records, each containing all the columns you'll need (e.g.  <code>SELECT TimeSlot, CustomerName, ContractorName FROM (joins go here) ...</code>)</p></li>
<li><p>create a custom collection class which puts that data into a format which is easy to data-bind. ""easy to data bind"" usually means that the data is organized in the same order that you're going to display it.  You also might need to do hacks like, for example, making all your rows the same length in order to databind the same number of table cells per row.</p></li>
<li><p>in your data-binding expressions, cast Container.DataItem to whatever type you need, in order to pull out properties of that type. This also has the added advantage of making databinding expressions with typos fail at compile time rather than waiting until runtime to find bugs.</p></li>
<li><p>for nesting, set the DataSource property of a nested template control (e.g. a repeater) to a property of the parent Container.DataItem</p></li>
<li><p>for header rows, here's a trick: put header code directly into the ItemTemplate, and use Container.ItemIndex==0 to know when to show the header line or not.  Since only Repeater (but not ListView) supports the ItemIndex property, I tend to use Repeater instead of ListView for most read-only data-binding tasks.  That's why I changed your ListView in my code sample below to use Repeater.  The same thing can be done by adding an Index or RowNumber property to your custom data-binding classes described above, but that's harder. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The general idea is that you want to push as much intelligence as possible <em>out</em> of your databinding code and into actual methods in your page (or code-behind) code, which is easier to write and debug.</p>

<p>Here's a working sample (with your classes and repository classes mocked up) to give you an idea what I'm talking about.  You should be able to adapt this to your situation.</p>

"1555433","<p>I'm working with a complicated xml schema, for which I have created a class structure using xsd.exe (with some effort).  I can now reliably deserialize the xml into the generated class structure.  For example, consider the following xml from the web service:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ODM FileType=""Snapshot"" CreationDateTime=""2009-10-09T19:58:46.5967434Z"" ODMVersion=""1.3.0"" SourceSystem=""XXX"" SourceSystemVersion=""999""&gt;
  &lt;Study OID=""2""&gt;
    &lt;GlobalVariables&gt;
      &lt;StudyName&gt;Test1&lt;/StudyName&gt;
      &lt;StudyDescription/&gt;
      &lt;ProtocolName&gt;Test0001&lt;/ProtocolName&gt;
    &lt;/GlobalVariables&gt;
    &lt;MetaDataVersion OID=""1"" Name=""Base Version"" Description=""""/&gt;
    &lt;MetaDataVersion OID=""2"" Name=""Test0001"" Description=""""/&gt;
    &lt;MetaDataVersion OID=""3"" Name=""Test0002"" Description=""""/&gt;
  &lt;/Study&gt;
&lt;/ODM&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I can deserialize the xml as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public ODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudy GetStudy(string studyId)
{
  ODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudy study = null;
  ODM odm = Deserialize&lt;ODM&gt;(Service.GetStudy(studyId));
  if (odm.Study.Length &gt; 0)
    study = odm.Study[0];
  return study;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Service.GetStudy() returns an HTTPResponse stream from the web service.  And Deserialize() is a helper method that deserializes the stream into the object type T.  </p>

<p>My question is this: is it more efficient to let the deserialization process create the entire class structure and deserialize the xml, or is it more efficient to grab only the xml of interest and deserialize that xml.  For example, I could replace the above code with:</p>

<pre><code>public ODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudy GetStudy(string studyId)
{
  ODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudy study = null;
  using (XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(Service.GetStudy(studyId)))
  {
    XDocument xdoc = XDocument.Load(reader);
    XNamespace odmns = xdoc.Root.Name.Namespace;
    XElement elStudy = xdoc.Root.Element(odmns + ""Study"");
    study = Deserialize&lt;ODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudy&gt;(elStudy.ToString());
  }
return study;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I suspect that the first approach is preferred -- there is a lot of dom manipulation going on in the second example, and the deserialization process must have optimizations; however, what happens when the xml grows dramatically?  Let's say the source returns 1 MB of xml and I'm really only interested in a very small component of that xml.  Should I let the deserialzation process fill up the containing ODM class with all it's arrays and properties of child nodes?  Or just go get the child node as in the second example!!??</p>

<p>Not sure this helps, but here's a summary image of the dilemma:</p>

<p>Later versions of .net will build custom serializer assemblies. Click on project properties -> build and look for ""Generate serialization assemblies"" and change to On. The XML deserializer will use these assemblies which are customized to the classes in your project. They are much faster and less resource intensive since reflection is not involved.</p>

<p>I would go this route so that if you class changes you will not have to worry about serialization issues. Performance should not be an issue.</p>

<pre><code>[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setFloat:[mySlider value] forKey:@""sliderValue""];

<p>To save the label's value:</p>

<pre><code>[[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setValue:[myLabel text] forKey:@""textValue""];

I had a several nested <code>WITH</code> statements so I have saved the result of query without applying <code>FOR XML EXPLICIT</code> into a temp table <code>@xmlTable</code> and then set the XML EXPLICIT result to an XML then returned it.</p>

<p>The separate characters are (usually) 16 by 24 pixels in size (that is, 24 pixels tall) and may be at any width and height without leaving padding. Kinda like this:</p>

<p>I already have the code to determine an integer-based clipping rectangle given a frame index and size:</p>

<pre><code>int framesPerRow = sheet.Width / cellWidth;
int framesPerColumn = sheet.Height / cellHeight;
framesTotal = framesPerRow * framesPerColumn;
int left = frameIndex % framesPerRow;
int top = frameIndex / framesPerRow;
//Clipping rect's width and height are obviously cellWidth and cellHeight.
</code></pre>

<p>Running this code with <code>frameIndex = 11, cellWidth = 16, cellHeight = 24</code> would return a cliprect <code>(32, 24)-(48, 48)</code> assuming it's Right/Bottom opposed to Width/Height.</p>

<p><strong>The actual question</strong></p>

<p>Now, given a clipping rectangle and an X/Y coordinate to place the sprite on, how do I draw this in OpenGL? Having the zero coordinate in the <em>top</em> left is preferred.</p>

"1573875","<p>I'm trying to build a simple component extending spark.components.Group to have a background color, more specifically a spark.primitives.Rect component stretched to fill the background. </p>

<p>This is what I've come up with thus far:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;s:Group xmlns:fx=""http://ns.adobe.com/mxml/2009"" xmlns:s=""library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark"" xmlns:mx=""library://ns.adobe.com/flex/halo""

    &lt;s:Rect id=""background"" width=""100%"" height=""100%""&gt;
        &lt;s:fill&gt;
            &lt;s:SolidColor color=""#990000""/&gt;
        &lt;/s:fill&gt;
    &lt;/s:Rect&gt;

    &lt;s:Group id=""container""/&gt;

    &lt;s:filters&gt;
        &lt;!-- For good measure ;) --&gt;
        &lt;s:DropShadowFilter color=""#000000"" strength=""0.4"" blurX=""5"" blurY=""5"" distance=""2"" angle=""90""/&gt;
    &lt;/s:filters&gt;

    &lt;fx:Script&gt;
        &lt;![CDATA[
            public function set content(value:Array):void {
                this.container.mxmlContent = value;
            }
        ]]&gt;
    &lt;/fx:Script&gt;
&lt;/s:Group&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so the logic here basically makes sense, right? All children declared in MXML go to the Group called ""container"". That is working just fine. However, when I run the example below, the layout is completely fubar. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;s:VGroup&gt;
    &lt;!-- This is the component described above --&gt;
    &lt;components:MessageContainer id=""component"" width=""100"" height=""100""/&gt;

"1574016","<p>I am a programmer doing web development for over two years now. Even though I’ve been doing front end engineering for the past two years I don’t think I have done it the right way<br>
<strong><em>For instance:</em></strong>  </p>

<ul>
<li>I still do layout with tables and not with just CSS. I haven’t still found out a way to correctly present data aligned and tabular.</li>
<li>I don’t know the difference between <code>display: none</code> and <code>visibility: hidden</code> (well, I know it now. but there are many cases like- padding, margins, overflows etc)</li>
<li>I haven’t really followed the inheritance way to writing CSS. Almost every style starts with a <code>#</code> and not a class.</li>
<li>Whenever a page loads slowly the html elements are out of place and fall into order only when it’s completely loaded.</li>
<li>I don’t know what this picture in firebug is conveying (by the way, firebug is my savior. Life would have been impossible without Firebug)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/lrd9j.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<ul>
<li>Whenever layout’s in a mess I am tempted to use position:absolute. Invariably it ends up in a bigger mess.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know I am doing a lot of things wrong(and I need to get it right) here but I manage to get things into place and somehow show it up, only to see it messed up in a different browser.  </p>

<p>I don’t want do a primer on CSS or CSS for dummies. I know more than that. I want to learn CSS the right way. Focusing on problems like the examples I showed above and rectifying them.   </p>

<p>Can you point me to resources or add common suggestions and tips used by CSS developers to get it right.</p>

","Slideshow plus pop-up Bubble conflict (jQuery)","<jquery><jcarousel>","2009-10-16 11:53:21","3370","1577945","1","<p>Your problem with the two implementations is that the carousel uses overflow hidden on both the DIV and the LI's wrapping each image.  When you hover over an image, your tooltip code is firing properly but you cannot actually see the tooltip being displayed because it's hidden above the LI element.</p>

<p>For a fix, you would have to have the tooltip event append the tooltip directly to the BODY tag and utilize a couple jquery techniques to find the of the LI that fired the event to reposition the tooltip.</p>

<p>Another possibility is to ensure that all images displayed have a fixed thumbnail size and you can do away with the overflow: hidden on all elements.  You would then need to add the following to the parent DIV that previously had overflow: hidden</p>

<pre><code>overflow-x: hidden;
</code></pre>

<p>This is because you really only care to hide the left and right sides of the carousel, not the top and bottom.  This would allow the tooltip to properly display as it displays in the positive Y axis of the LI.</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT</em></strong></p>

<p>You'll want to modify these lines in the jCarousel JS:</p>

<pre><code>li.css({overflow: ""hidden"", float: o.vertical ? ""none"" : ""left""});
div.css({overflow: ""hidden"", position: ""relative"", ""z-index"": ""2"", left: ""0px""});
</code></pre>

<p>And make sure you have a CSS style to increase the z-index of the tooltip to at least 3.</p>

<p>So, I ended up making my own <em>basic</em> solution to this problem, and it can be found in my own answer to the question below. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1579412/windows-forms-components-similar-to-jquery-ui-draggables/1591964#1591964"">Or, here's a link.</a></p>

<p><strong>Original Post</strong></p>

<p>I'm doing some UI programming for a small .NET application. The application has some collections of items that need to be displayed in a grid sort of format (X columns by Y rows) and the grid elements need to be able to get dragged around to different grid locations, and possibly out of the grid all together.</p>

<p>The most comparable sort of UI design elements I can think of are the <a href=""http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jQueryUI Draggables</a>.</p>

<p>Do I have to roll my own or are there components people have already written to act like this? Even better, are there any <em>free</em> components? Or is there an easy way to do this that I just don't know about (don't do a lot of .NET UI programming..)</p>

<p>Also these ""grid items"" need to be able to include windows form components. The <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/vsdata/archive/2009/08/12/datarepeater-control-for-windows-forms.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DataRepeater</a> control is <em>close</em> to what I need, except it only supports horizontal or vertical alignments, not grids of items.</p>

<p>Here's a visual example of what I'm looking for:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The displayed resolution of an image item is dependent on the sizeMode of the toolbar. You should provide image representations specific to the default, regular and small size modes in a single image that supports multiple image representations such as icns or tiff. The appropriate image representation is automatically displayed for the toolbar's current sizeMode. <em>If an appropriate representation is not available, the toolbar scales the representation to the appropriate size for the current mode, at a cost in performance and appearance.</em> Images that are not square are scaled to fit. An image item’s image is also scaled down and used in the image item’s overflow menu item. (Emphasis added)</p>

<p>If you have background to panel A, you should set it to the container, and inherit it from.</p>
<h3>Edit:</h3>
<p>Q: <em>How do I ensure that panel C doesn't slide under panel A when A's content is shorter/equal to Panel B?</em><br />
A: You have two option:<br />
a) Wrap B and C to a wrapper div:</p>
<p>HTML</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;side&quot;&gt; panel A&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div id=&quot;head&quot;&gt; panel B&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt; panel C&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>b) Play with padding; set 20% padding to the container, and -20% margin to the side:</p>
<p>CSS</p>
<pre><code>#container{
    width: 80%;
    padding: 0 0 0 20%;

The reason is you can use only texture sizes that are powers of two with GL_TEXTURE_2D.

","Check if two linked lists merge. If so, where?","<algorithm><linked-list><data-structures>","2009-10-20 11:51:10","51064","1594364","27","<p>If</p>

<ul>
<li>by ""modification is not allowed"" it was meant ""you may change but in the end they should be restored"", and</li>
<li>we could iterate the lists exactly <em>twice</em></li>
</ul>

<p>the following algorithm would be the solution.</p>

<p>First, the numbers.  Assume the first list is of length <code>a+c</code> and the second one is of length <code>b+c</code>, where <code>c</code> is the length of their common ""tail"" (after the mergepoint).  Let's denote them as follows:</p>

<pre><code>x = a+c
y = b+c
</code></pre>

<p>Since we don't know the length, we will calculate <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> without additional iterations; you'll see how.</p>

<p>Then, we iterate each list and reverse them while iterating!  If both iterators reach the merge point at the same time, then we find it out by mere comparing.  Otherwise, one pointer will reach the merge point before the other one.</p>

<p>After that, when the other iterator reaches the merge point, it won't proceed to the common tail. Instead will go back to the former beginning of the list that had reached merge-point before!  So, before it reaches the end of the changed list (i.e. the former beginning of the other list), he will make <code>a+b+1</code> iterations total.  Let's call it <code>z+1</code>.</p>

<p>The pointer that reached the merge-point first, will keep iterating, until reaches the end of the list.  The number of iterations it made should be calculated and is equal to <code>x</code>.</p>

<p>Then, this pointer iterates back and reverses the lists again.  But now it won't go back to the beginning of the list it originally started from!  Instead, it will go to the beginning of the other list!  The number of iterations it made should be calculated and equal to <code>y</code>.</p>

<p>So we know the following numbers:</p>

<pre><code>x = a+c
y = b+c
z = a+b
</code></pre>

<p>From which we determine that</p>

<pre><code>a = (+x-y+z)/2
b = (-x+y+z)/2
c = (+x+y-z)/2
</code></pre>

<p>Which solves the problem.</p>

<p>The whole point of layout managers is to allow dynamic resizing, which is necessary not just for user-resizable windows but also changing texts (internationalization) and different default font sizes and fonts.</p>

<p>If you just <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/layout/using.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">use the layout managers correctly</a>, they will take care of panel sizes.

"
"1596961","<p>I have a C# application which shows the current time in a 
transparent .NET Form. The Form has no controls and no border.
Its property TransparencyKey is set to the Form's background color 
""light gray"" to make it transparent.<br>
So the user can only see the text (current time).</p>

<p>The text is drawn in the PaintEventHandler:</p>

<pre><code>private void Display_Paint( object sender, PaintEventArgs e )
{
    Graphics formGraphics = e.Graphics;

    Font myFont = new Font( ""Microsoft Sans Serif"", 24, FontStyle.Bold );

    formGraphics.TextRenderingHint = System.Drawing.Text.TextRenderingHint.AntiAlias;
    //formGraphics.TextRenderingHint = System.Drawing.Text.TextRenderingHint.SingleBitPerPixel;

    formGraphics.DrawString( ""00:00:00"", myFont, Brushes.Green, 0.0F, 0.0F );

    myFont.Dispose();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Due to the anti-aliasing the text ""00:00:00"" is shown frayed when the 
Form is over a dark background. For light backgrounds the text is o.k.</p>

<p>This image shows the problem and the good case:</p>

<p>Obviously Windows does render the text in a way that it fits to the
Form's own background color and not in a way that it fits to the 
background which is behind the transparent Form.</p>

<p>Is it possible to let Windows take the background behind
the Form into account when rendering the text so that I get
rid of the fringes? </p>

<p>One ""solution"" could be to switch off anti-aliasing by setting TextRenderingHint
accordingly. But up to now this is not my preferred ""solution"".</p>

"1597511","<p>I'm developing a little portfolio where I can choose a category and when I click it, the content (thumbnails) of that category will be shown (this is via an array).</p>

<p>e.g. </p>

<pre><code>photography[0] = &lt;a href=""..."" rel=""lightbox"" /&gt;&lt;img ...  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
photography[1] = &lt;a href=""..."" rel=""lightbox"" /&gt;&lt;img ...  /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>At first the site shows the content of all categories and when I click a thumbnail it activates lightbox, however if I choose a category and then press one of the remaining thumbnails is simply leads to the image and does not open the image with lightbox.</p>

<p>This is how the thumbnails look like on the initial load of the page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;a title=""..."" rel=""lightbox"" href=""http://...yellow-brick-road.jpg"" class=""thumbnaila""&gt; &lt;img class=""thumbnail "" alt="""" src=""http://...yellow-brick-road.jpg"" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p> 
</p>

<p>When a category is selected it removes the content within the div and replaces it by other content e.g. exactly the same content. (so the rel=""lightbox"" is still there).</p>

<p>If anyone could help me out with this one I would love it (I'm using jquery btw).</p>

<p>EDIT after response Alex Sexton:</p>

<pre><code>$("".thumbnaila"").live(""mouseover"", function(){
    activateLightbox($(this));});

function activateLightbox(dit) {
    $('a[rel=""lightbox""]').lightBox({
            overlayBgColor: '#000',
            overlayOpacity: 0.65,
            containerResizeSpeed: 350
    });
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>but now when I choose a categorie and select a thumbnail it loads the right lightbox but also loads an empty lightbox above the one I want as you can see:</p>

"1598502","<p>Since upgrading to Xcode 3.2.1, I've experienced a strange issue that has really killed my workflow. The issue only exhibits itself under my own user account (the same project opened by a different user works fine). Therefore, the heart of this question is, ""what does Xcode load from the user directory that could conceivably cause this issue?""</p>

<p>(System: Snow Leopard 10.6.1; Xcode 3.2.1 w/ iPhone SDK 3.1.2)</p>

<p>Symptoms:</p>

<ul>
<li>Code completion only works on symbols of the current class or already referenced in the class. Virtually useless.</li>
<li>Document/reference lookups (i.e. option-double-clicking on an identifier or symbol returns this strange result): ""Documentation not found for the symbol '<code>symbol name</code>'. Click here to view symbol declaration.""</li>
</ul>

<p>Like I said, since other users are experiencing normal behavior in Xcode, this must be due to something only loaded for my user account. I've already eliminated <code>~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.Xcode.plist</code>, <code>~/Application Support/Developer,</code>~/Application Support/Xcode`.  </p>

<p>The only thing I've recently installed is <a href=""http://rentzsch.com/code/mogenerator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mogenerator</a> (the defunct xmod integration may have killed it, but it doesn't install anything to the user directory)</p>

<p><em>Update: 10/26/09</em>
This one is really starting to kill me. I did a fresh OS X install, followed by an Xcode 3.2 install from the Leopard disc, followed by an iPhone SDK install from the ADC site, and this started occurring again within 30 minutes of my having started working. I'm at an utter loss. The error is most obvious when option-double-clicking on a symbol (say, the <code>NSString</code> class) and instead of getting the documentation snippet, a message ""Cannot determine the symbol for the current selection."" appears.</p>

<p><em>Update: 10/26/09 #2</em>
I just tried creating a fresh project, and that project's symbols are appearing fine. So the issue is apparently local to my project. Hopefully that's a better start. To demonstrate what I'm talking about, here's a screen of the issue manifesting itself with respect to documentation:</p>

<p>After doing that, check Console.app to see if Xcode issued any warnings.  It's possible that some of your source code causes the indexer to stop, and you don't end up with a valid index. Filing a bug with Apple and providing the source, if possible, would help Apple fix problems like this.</p>

"1619505","<p>I just started learning the MVVM pattern for WPF. I hit a wall: <strong>what do you do when you need to show an <code>OpenFileDialog</code></strong>?</p>

<p>Here's an example UI I'm trying to use it on:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/rKeux.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>When the browse button is clicked, an <code>OpenFileDialog</code> should be shown. When the user selects a file from the <code>OpenFileDialog</code>, the file path should be displayed in the textbox.</p>

<p>How can I do this with MVVM?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: How can I do this with MVVM and make it unit test-able? The solution below doesn't work for unit testing.</p>
","WPF OpenFileDialog with the MVVM pattern?","<c#><wpf><xaml><mvvm><openfiledialog>","2009-10-24 23:36:35","76567","1622980","5","<p>What I generally do is create an interface for an application service that performs this function. In my examples I'll assume you are using something like the MVVM Toolkit or similar thing (so I can get a base ViewModel and a <code>RelayCommand</code>).</p>
<p>Here's an example of an extremely simple interface for doing basic IO operations like <code>OpenFileDialog</code> and <code>OpenFile</code>.  I'm showing them both here so you don't think I'm suggesting you create one interface with one method to get around this problem.</p>
<pre><code>public interface IOService
{
     string OpenFileDialog(string defaultPath);

     //Other similar untestable IO operations
     Stream OpenFile(string path);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In your application, you would provide a default implementation of this service.  Here is how you would consume it.</p>
<pre><code>public MyViewModel : ViewModel
{
     private string _selectedPath;
     public string SelectedPath
     {
          get { return _selectedPath; }
          set { _selectedPath = value; OnPropertyChanged(&quot;SelectedPath&quot;); }
     }

     private RelayCommand _openCommand;
     public RelayCommand OpenCommand
     {
          //You know the drill.
          ...
     }
     
     private IOService _ioService;
     public MyViewModel(IOService ioService)
     {
          _ioService = ioService;
          OpenCommand = new RelayCommand(OpenFile);
     }

     private void OpenFile()
     {
          SelectedPath = _ioService.OpenFileDialog(@&quot;c:\Where\My\File\Usually\Is.txt&quot;);
          if(SelectedPath == null)
          {
               SelectedPath = string.Empty;
          }
     }
}
</code></pre>
<p>So that's pretty simple. Now for the last part: testability. This one should be obvious, but I'll show you how to make a simple test for this. I use Moq for stubbing, but you can use whatever you'd like of course.</p>
<pre><code>[Test]
public void OpenFileCommand_UserSelectsInvalidPath_SelectedPathSetToEmpty()
{
     Mock&lt;IOService&gt; ioServiceStub = new Mock&lt;IOService&gt;();
     
     //We use null to indicate invalid path in our implementation
     ioServiceStub.Setup(ioServ =&gt; ioServ.OpenFileDialog(It.IsAny&lt;string&gt;()))
                  .Returns(null);

     //Setup target and test
     MyViewModel target = new MyViewModel(ioServiceStub.Object);
     target.OpenCommand.Execute();

     Assert.IsEqual(string.Empty, target.SelectedPath);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This will probably work for you.</p>
<p>There is a library out on CodePlex called &quot;SystemWrapper&quot; (<a href=""http://systemwrapper.codeplex.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://systemwrapper.codeplex.com</a>) that might save you from having to do a <em>lot</em> of this kind of thing. It looks like <code>FileDialog</code> is not supported yet, so you'll definitely have to write an interface for that one.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>
<p>I seem to remember you favoring TypeMock Isolator for your faking framework.  Here's the same test using Isolator:</p>
<pre><code>[Test]
[Isolated]
public void OpenFileCommand_UserSelectsInvalidPath_SelectedPathSetToEmpty()
{
    IOService ioServiceStub = Isolate.Fake.Instance&lt;IOService&gt;();

    //Setup stub arrangements
    Isolate.WhenCalled(() =&gt; ioServiceStub.OpenFileDialog(&quot;blah&quot;))
           .WasCalledWithAnyArguments()
           .WillReturn(null);

     //Setup target and test
     MyViewModel target = new MyViewModel(ioServiceStub);
     target.OpenCommand.Execute();

     Assert.IsEqual(string.Empty, target.SelectedPath);
}

"1619917","<p>In my application I would like to provide a dashboard like screen when they login to get an overview of what is happening. I have about 4 models I would need to collect data from and sort them into order. My problem is knowing <em>the</em> action, so I can get specific fields per model.</p>

<p>Here are a few ideas of how to go about it, but I feel they aren't the best and incomplete at best.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have a separate model that contains the: model, associated_id, action. ""Post, 1, created"" could be an example.</p></li>
<li><p>Have 4 different arrays, and merge them with the correct order by say <code>created_at</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What is the best way to go about this? I have provided an example below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/DKpFt.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>
","Application Dashboard View Logic","<ruby-on-rails><ruby><dashboard>","2009-10-25 03:26:58","947","1621328","2","<p>Use a separate model to store the feed entries as you suggest in your first idea.  The design pattern your looking at is called <a href=""http://railscasts.com/episodes/154-polymorphic-association"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">polymorphic association pattern</a></p>

<p>Let's assume this new model is called Feed, following the polymorphic associaiton pattern you would use the columns: feedable_type and feedable_id (as apposed to your suggested column names model and associated_id)</p>

<p>I do have to admit that your problem is larger than the simple understanding of polymorphic associations, feeds are a major innovation of modern information design and entail many complex features including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Privacy</li>
<li>Follow / Subscribe</li>
<li>Filtering</li>
<li>Merging</li>
</ul>

<p>All this can become intensely more complicated depending on any of these attributes.  And if you have to meet some non-functional requirements like scaling and performance the headache will quickly compound.</p>

<p>If you've ever built a Facebook application, it is quite enlightening to see how their feed publishing API works.</p>

<p>You will quickly notice that the separate model used to store the feed is quite unequipped to render the feed entries HTML, but loading the original model that is well equipped to render the HTML is database expensive.  To solve this problem, I have the original model render the feed's HTML and I store this into the feed table.</p>

<p>Of course the implementation is even a little more complex than this.  Like with Facebook, all feeds have 1 point in common (They come from people).  So each feed entry has user_id (so to speak).  Since we know all feeds have this data and can render the ""who did it"" portion of the news feed, we don't pre-render that part.</p>

<p>It's quite helpful to pre-render as much as possible that would be difficult to re-build from the feed model later, but delay pre-rendering when we are sure that component is ubiquitous and be tucked into our feed model.</p>

<p>Finally, studying open source projects is a good way to learn</p>

<p>As u can see in the code I have “Use Proxy” checkbox which is when selected should enable groupbox1 or vice versa. The problem is when the form is loading setting from “user.config“even if the check control is unselected groupbox 1 is enabled. One way to handle this situation is to check for the control in form load event i.e. </p>

<pre><code>groupBox2.Enabled = checkBox1.Checked;
</code></pre>

<p>is there any other to do this and make my application more dinamic? 
The reason I am asking this is because there can be situations where  multiple controls are on a single form, and I think it will become confusing.</p>

<ul>
<li>Instead of creating a coupled dependency between controls, create a value describing the state instead</li>
<li>Collect code that alters the UI state of controls (such as <code>Visible</code> and <code>Enabled</code>) into  one single method, and call that whenever needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>private bool _useProxy;
private bool UseProxy
{
    get
    {
        return _useProxy;
    }
    set
    {
        bool valueChanged = _useProxy != value;
        _useProxy = value;
        if (valueChanged)

private void SetControlStates()
{
    groupBox2.Enabled = this.UseProxy;
    checkBox1.Checked = this.UseProxy;
}

private void checkBox1_CheckedChanged(object sender, EventArgs 
    this.UseProxy = checkBox1.Checked;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in <code>Form_Load</code>, when reading from the configuration file, you simply assign <code>this.UseProxy</code> with the value from the file. This way different controls are not dependent in each other in the same way, but rather on the state that they are related to.</p>

"1621480","<p>I just finished participating in the 2009 ACM ICPC Programming Conest in the Latinamerican Finals. These questions were for Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, etc.</p>

<p>My team and I could only finish two questions out of the eleven (not bad I think for the first try).</p>

<p>Here's one we could finish. I'm curious to seeing any variations to the code. The question in full: <em>ps: These questions can also be found on the official ICPC website available to everyone.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>In the land of ACM ruled a greeat king who became obsessed with order. The kingdom had a rectangular form, and the king divided the territory into a grid of small rectangular counties. Before dying the king distributed the counties among his sons.</p>

<p>The king was unaware of the rivalries between his sons: The first heir hated the second but not the rest, the second hated the third but not the rest, and so on...Finally, the last heir hated the first heir, but not the other heirs.</p>

<p>As soon as the king died, the strange rivaly among the King's sons sparked off a generalized war in the kingdom. Attacks only took place between pairs of adjacent counties (adjacent counties are those that share one vertical or horizontal border). A county X attacked an adjacent county Y whenever X hated Y. The attacked county was always conquered. All attacks where carried out simultanously and a set of simultanous attacks was called a <em>battle</em>. After a certain number of battles, the surviving sons made a truce and never battled again.</p>

<p>For example if the king had three sons, named <em>0, 1 and 2</em>, the figure below shows what happens in the first battle for a given initial land distribution:</p>

<p><img src=""https://imgur.com/4FcP4.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>INPUT</strong></p>

<p>The input contains several test cases. The first line of a test case contains four integers, <em>N, R, C and K</em>. </p>

<ol>
<li>N - The number of heirs (2 &lt;= N &lt;= 100)</li>
<li>R and C - The dimensions of the land. (2 &lt;= R,C &lt;= 100)</li>
<li>K - Number of battles that are going to take place. (1 &lt;= K &lt;= 100)</li>
</ol>

<p>Heirs are identified by sequential integers starting from zero. Each of the next R lines contains C integers HeirIdentificationNumber (saying what heir owns this land) separated by single spaces. This is to layout the initial land.</p>

<p>The last test case is a line separated by four zeroes separated by single spaces. (To exit the program so to speak)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Output</strong></p>

<p>For each test case your program must print R lines with C integers each, separated by single spaces in the same format as the input, representing the land distribution after all battles.</p>

<p>WinForms' ListViewItem class has a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.listviewitem.name.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Name</a> property, which you can use to look up a specific item in a list. So as you populate the list, assign a unique value to the Name of each:</p>

<pre><code>var item = new ListViewItem(""Text"");
item.Name = ""foo""; // some unique id string
listView1.Items.Add(item);

If it is not connected in IB (or set in code), you'll get this message. In IB, click on ""File's Owner"", then click on the ""Connections"" tab in the Inspector. Under ""Outlets"" what is the ""view"" parameter connected to? It needs to be connected to the view you intend to control from your InfoController.</p>

<p>That being said, there is some inconsistency in what you are showing in your screenshot. Normally, you won't have a UINavigationController be part of your UIViewController xib. Instead, it should be in your MainWindow.xib. You can try to drag a connection from your File's Owner to the view inside of your navigation controller, but I don't think that will work. You'll have to move the navigation controller to your MainWindow.xib and then set it's view to be of type InfoController using xib InfoController.</p>

<p>If this is unclear, create a new project using the ""Navigation-based Application"" template in Xcode. Then open the MainWindow.xib file in IB. You'll see in there how the navigation controller should be set up.</p>

","Is there a tool to draw geometry shapes programatically?","<drawing>","2009-10-26 12:28:38","932","1625251","3","<p>Basically, you would draw on a bitmap in RAM to generate the picture, then either save it as a GIF file, or emit it directly to the browser, telling it that you are sending a GIF file. You will have to do the same kind of tiling and positioning of separate elements that web designers do in Photoshop, except that your code will do the work.</p>

<p>For one possible library see <a href=""http://newcenturycomputers.net/projects/gd-ref.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libgd here</a> where you would probably use <code>line()</code> to draw the straight lines and <code>arc()</code> to draw the corners. Of course, to get a shaded line, you need to draw multiple lines, offsetting a bit each time and changing the color.</p>

<p>To see how web designers do it, have a look at <a href=""http://www.neuroticweb.com/recursos/css-rounded-box/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this page</a>. Note the list of corner images that are used. Before coding, it always helps to understand alternate ways of doing it. You might prefer <a href=""http://www.spiffycorners.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">leveraging CSS instead</a>, which is probably easier to code.</p>

<p>I don't recommend using any canvas because most browsers don't support it, and for much the same reason, I don't think that SVG is a good way to do it for general purpose websites where you are just dressing up the look of the content.</p>

If you compiled and got the warning and later on removed it from the compilation process by means of a pragma or compiler option, it might be the case that the IDE still remembers it. It should go away in a later compilation, or you can manually delete within the Problems windows.</p>

<p>If you have not removed it from the compilation process (that is, the warning comes out in each new compilation) this will be mainly useless as the warning will come back. But then again, if it is still there, the IDE is just reminding you.</p>

<p>Back in 2003 (when I was 17), I competed in a <a href=""http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/t89846.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Battleship AI</a> coding competition.  Even though I lost that tournament, I had a lot of fun and learned a lot from it.</p>

<p>Now, I would like to resurrect this competition, in the search of the best battleship AI.</p>

<p>Here is <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/otac0n/battleship"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the framework, now hosted on Bitbucket</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The winner will be awarded +450 reputation!</strong> The competition will be held starting on the <strong>17th of November, 2009</strong>.  No entries or edits later than zero-hour on the 17th will be accepted.  (Central Standard Time)
Submit your entries early, so you don't miss your opportunity!</p>

<p><em>To keep this <strong>OBJECTIVE</strong>, please follow the spirit of the competition.</em></p>

<p><strong>Rules of the game:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The game is be played on a 10x10 grid.</li>
<li>Each competitor will place each of 5 ships (of lengths 2, 3, 3, 4, 5) on their grid.</li>
<li>No ships may overlap, but they may be adjacent.</li>
<li>The competitors then take turns firing single shots at their opponent.

<ul>
<li>A variation on the game allows firing multiple shots per volley, one for each surviving ship.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The opponent will notify the competitor if the shot sinks, hits, or misses.</li>
<li>Game play ends when all of the ships of any one player are sunk.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Rules of the competition:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>The spirit of the competition is to find the best Battleship algorithm.</li>
<li>Anything that is deemed against the spirit of the competition will be grounds for disqualification.</li>
<li>Interfering with an opponent is against the spirit of the competition.</li>
<li>Multithreading may be used under the following restrictions:

<ul>
<li>No more than one thread may be running while it is not your turn. (Though, any number of threads may be in a ""Suspended"" state).</li>
<li>No thread may run at a priority other than ""Normal"".</li>
<li>Given the above two restrictions, you will be guaranteed at least 3 dedicated CPU cores during your turn.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A limit of 1 second of CPU time per game is allotted to each competitor on the primary thread.</li>
<li>Running out of time results in losing the current game.</li>
<li>Any unhandled exception will result in losing the current game.</li>
<li>Network access and disk access is allowed, but you may find the time restrictions fairly prohibitive.  However, a few set-up and tear-down methods have been added to alleviate the time strain.</li>
<li>Code should be posted on stack overflow as an answer, or, if too large, linked.</li>
<li>Max total size (un-compressed) of an entry is 1 MB.</li>
<li>Officially, .Net 2.0 / 3.5 is the only framework requirement.</li>
<li>Your entry must implement the IBattleshipOpponent interface.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Scoring:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Best 51 games out of 101 games is the winner of a match.</li>
<li>All competitors will play matched against each other, round-robin style.</li>
<li>The best half of the competitors will then play a double-elimination tournament to determine the winner.  (Smallest power of two that is greater than or equal to half, actually.)</li>
<li>I will be using the <a href=""https://github.com/otac0n/tournaments"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TournamentApi</a> framework for the tournament.</li>
<li>The results will be posted here.</li>
<li>If you submit more than one entry, only your best-scoring entry is eligible for the double-elim.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good luck! Have fun!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 1:</strong><br/>
Thanks to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/190480/freed"">Freed</a>, who has found an error in the <code>Ship.IsValid</code> function.  It has been fixed.  Please download the updated version of the framework.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong><br/>
Since there has been significant interest in persisting stats to disk and such, I have added a few non-timed set-up and tear-down events that should provide the required functionality.  This is a <strong>semi-breaking change</strong>.  That is to say: the interface has been modified to add functions, but no body is required for them.  Please download the updated version of the framework.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong><br/>
Bug Fix 1: <code>GameWon</code> and <code>GameLost</code> were only getting called in the case of a time out.<br/>
Bug Fix 2: If an engine was timing out every game, the competition would never end.<br/>
Please download the updated version of the framework.</p>

            style=""@style/CoinLightTheme""&gt;

// Lots more layout omitted
</code></pre>

<p>I extracted out the bit that's repeated into an xml file called show_toolbar.xml, changing the names of variables to make it more generic across the 3 views</p>

<pre><code>&lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    android:id=""@+id/show_toolbar""
    style=""@style/showItemToolbar""&gt;

        android:layout_alignParentLeft=""true"" 
        android:id=""@+id/show_back_button""/&gt;

    &lt;Button android:id=""@+id/show_map_button""

&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then from within my original layout file, I replaced that big block of code with</p>

<pre><code>&lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
                android:layout_height=""fill_parent""

    &lt;include android:id=""@+id/show_toolbar"" layout=""@layout/show_toolbar""/&gt;

    &lt;ScrollView xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
        android:layout_height=""fill_parent"" 
        android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
        android:layout_above=""@id/showedit_toolbar""         
        style=""@style/CoinLightTheme""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the problem is that the view no longer shows up.  I can still click the buttons and they respond (i.e. if I click in the corner where the button should be, it still works), but I cannot see the buttons or bar onto which they were drawn.  </p>

<p>I cannot find very good documentation on how Include is supposed to work, so perhaps I am using it incorrectly.  Any help would be appreciated</p>

"1647631","<p>I am crafting a small project in mixed C and C++.  I am building one small-ish state-machine at the heart of one of my worker thread.</p>

<p>I was wondering if you gurus on SO would share your state-machine design techniques.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I am primarily after tried &amp; tested implementation techniques.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED:</strong> Based on all the great input gathered on SO, I've settled on this architecture:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/l9jGt.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/l9jGt.png"" alt=""An event pump points to an event integrator which points to a dispatcher. The dispatcher points to 1 through n actions which point back to the event integrator. A transition table with wildcards points to the dispatcher.""></a></p>
","C state-machine design","<c++><c><architecture><state-machine>","2009-10-30 02:08:33","105665","1647679","26","<p>State machines that I've designed before (C, not C++) have all come down to a <code>struct</code> array and a loop. The structure basically consists of a state and event (for look-up) and a function that returns the new state, something like:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct {
    int st;
    int ev;
    int (*fn)(void);
} tTransition;
</code></pre>

<p>Then you define your states and events with simple defines (the <code>ANY</code> ones are special markers, see below):</p>

<pre><code>#define ST_ANY              -1
#define ST_INIT              0
#define ST_ERROR             1
#define ST_TERM              2
: :
#define EV_ANY              -1
#define EV_KEYPRESS       5000
#define EV_MOUSEMOVE      5001
</code></pre>

<p>Then you define all the functions that are called by the transitions:</p>

<pre><code>static int GotKey (void) { ... };
static int FsmError (void) { ... };
</code></pre>

<p>All these function are written to take no variables and return the new state for the state machine. In this example global variables are used for passing any information into the state functions where necessary.</p>

<p>Using globals isn't as bad as it sounds since the FSM is usually locked up inside a single compilation unit and all variables are static to that unit (which is why I used quotes around ""global"" above - they're more shared within the FSM, than truly global). As with all globals, it requires care.</p>

<p>The transitions array then defines all possible transitions and the functions that get called for those transitions (including the catch-all last one):</p>

<pre><code>tTransition trans[] = {
    { ST_INIT, EV_KEYPRESS, &amp;GotKey},
    : :
    { ST_ANY, EV_ANY, &amp;FsmError}
};
#define TRANS_COUNT (sizeof(trans)/sizeof(*trans))
</code></pre>

<p>What that means is: if you're in the <code>ST_INIT</code> state and you receive the <code>EV_KEYPRESS</code> event, make a call to <code>GotKey</code>.</p>

<p>The workings of the FSM then become a relatively simple loop:</p>

<pre><code>state = ST_INIT;
while (state != ST_TERM) {
    event = GetNextEvent();
    for (i = 0; i &lt; TRANS_COUNT; i++) {
        if ((state == trans[i].st) || (ST_ANY == trans[i].st)) {
            if ((event == trans[i].ev) || (EV_ANY == trans[i].ev)) {
                state = (trans[i].fn)();
                break;
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As alluded to above, note the use of <code>ST_ANY</code> as wild-cards, allowing an event to call a function no matter the current state. <code>EV_ANY</code> also works similarly, allowing any event at a specific state to call a function.</p>

<p>It can also guarantee that, if you reach the end of the transitions array, you get an error stating your FSM hasn't been built correctly (by using the <code>ST_ANY/EV_ANY</code> combination.</p>

<p>I've used code similar for this on a great many communications projects, such as an early implementation of communications stacks and protocols for embedded systems. The big advantage was its simplicity and relative ease in changing the transitions array.</p>

<p>I've no doubt there will be higher-level abstractions which may be more suitable nowadays but I suspect they'll all boil down to this same sort of structure. </p>

<hr>

<p>And, as <code>ldog</code> states in a comment, you can avoid the globals altogether by passing a structure pointer to all functions (and using that in the event loop). This will allow multiple state machines to run side-by-side without interference.</p>

<p>Just create a structure type which holds the machine-specific data (state at a bare minimum) and use that instead of the globals.</p>

<p>The reason I've rarely done that is simply because most of the state machines I've written have been singleton types (one-off, at-process-start, configuration file reading for example), not needing to run more than one instance. But it has value if you need to run more than one.</p>

<ol>
<li>Write your own GTK theme engine (see Murrine or Clearlooks).</li>

<p>GTK isn't really meant for this sort of thing.

If you design your own look and there's no way to change it, then someone with color blindness or poor eyesight won't be able to use it. Or the text will get all misaligned if someone uses your application in another language. Or at the very least, maybe someone just likes a black desktop with white lettering, and your application will stick out and look really ugly on that user's computer.

"1669216","<p>I have written C# code to save product specifications to a PDF document using iTextSharp, mainly with PdfPTable and Chunks/Paragraphs in the PdfPCells. However, I have been told that the output is unacceptable due to the fact that you can highlight and copy the text from the document and document storage and retrieval server software that they are currently using does not support ""Vector"" based PDFs.  I'm not exactly certain what the difference is between a raster pdf and and vector pdf.  Basically, every page of the PDF Document should be an image so that the text can not be highlighted.  Is there any way to do this without using the DirectContent?  Below is an image, illustrating a portion of the PDF that was created, and how the text can be selected and copied, which is the incorrect functionality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><code>git cherry-pick</code> learned to pick a range of commits

<ul>
<li><code>A</code> should be older than <code>B</code>, or <code>A</code> should be from another branch.</li>

"1671210","<p>I am working on an ongoing project where I want to align the links of a chain so that it follows the contours of a Bezier curve. I am currently following the steps below.</p>

<ol>
<li>Drawing the curve.</li>
<li>Use a display list to create one link of the chain.</li>
<li>Use a FOR loop to repeatedly call a function that calculates the angle between two points on the curve, returns the angle and the axis around which the link should be rotated.</li>
<li>Rotate by the angle ""a"" and translate to new position, place the link at the new position.</li>
</ol>

<p>Edit: I should also say that the centres of the two half torus must lie on the Bezier curve.
Also I am aware that the method I use to draw the torus I tedious, I will use TRIANGLE_FAN or QUAD_STRIP later on to draw the torus in a more efficient way.</p>

I.E. a glTranslatef(0.0,0.0,0.0); won't go to the origin, it will just move the ""pen"" nowhere. Luckily, the ""pen"" starts at the origin. if you translate out to 1.0,1.0,1.0 then try a glTranslatef(0.0,0.0,0.0); you will still be drawing at 1.0,1.0,1.0;</p>

<p>Also, you seem to grasp the fact that openGL post-multiplies matricies. To that end, you are correctly ""undoing"" your matrix operations after a draw. I only see one spot where you could potentially be off here and that is in this statement:</p>

<p>Here you correctly undo the second rotation, but the first one you seem to rotate even more around the y axis. the very last glRotatef needs to read glRotatef(-90,0,1,0); if you want to be undoing that rotation.</p>

","Country/State/City dropdown menus inside the Django admin inline","<django><django-admin><django-forms>","2009-11-04 02:49:56","15302","2135647","3","<p>With a little hackery, it's quite doable.</p>
<p>In the following example, <strong>County</strong> is used instead of <strong>State</strong> and <strong>Municipality</strong> instead of <strong>City</strong>. So, the models are as follows:</p>
<pre><code>class County(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(_('Name'), max_length=100, unique=True)

class Municipality(models.Model):
    county = models.ForeignKey(County, verbose_name=_('County'))
    name = models.CharField(_('Name'), max_length=100)

class Location(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    county = models.ForeignKey(County, verbose_name=_('County'))
    municipality = models.ForeignKey(Municipality,
            verbose_name=_(&quot;Municipality&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p>There are two sides of the problem: client-side JavaScript and server side field rendering.</p>
<p>The client side JavaScript (with JQuery, assumed to be served from <strong>/site_media/js/municipality.js</strong>) is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>var response_cache = {};

function fill_municipalities(county_id) {
  if (response_cache[county_id]) {
    $(&quot;#id_municipality&quot;).html(response_cache[county_id]);
  } else {
    $.getJSON(&quot;/municipalities_for_county/&quot;, {county_id: county_id},
      function(ret, textStatus) {
        var options = '&lt;option value=&quot;&quot; selected=&quot;selected&quot;&gt;---------&lt;/option&gt;';
        for (var i in ret) {
          options += '&lt;option value=&quot;' + ret[i].id + '&quot;&gt;'
            + ret[i].name + '&lt;/option&gt;';
        }
        response_cache[county_id] = options;
        $(&quot;#id_municipality&quot;).html(options);
      });
  }
}

$(document).ready(function() {
  $(&quot;#id_county&quot;).change(function() { fill_municipalities($(this).val()); });
});
</code></pre>
<p>Now you need the Ajax view for serving municipalities that belong to a given county (assumed to be served from <strong>/municipalities_for_county/</strong>):</p>
<pre><code>from django.http import JSONResponse
from django.utils.encoding import smart_unicode
from django.utils import simplejson

from myproject.places.models import Municipality

def municipalities_for_county(request):
    if request.is_ajax() and request.GET and 'county_id' in request.GET:
        objs = Municipality.objects.filter(county=request.GET['county_id'])
        return JSONResponse([{'id': o.id, 'name': smart_unicode(o)}
            for o in objs])
    else:
        return JSONResponse({'error': 'Not Ajax or no GET'})
</code></pre>
<p>And finally the server side code in <em>admin.py</em> for rendering the field is as follows.
First, the imports:</p>
<pre><code>from django import forms
from django.forms import widgets
from django.forms.utils import flatatt
from django.utils.encoding import smart_text
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe
from django.contrib import admin

from myproject.places.models import Municipality, Location
</code></pre>
<p>Then, the widget:</p>
<pre><code>class MunicipalityChoiceWidget(widgets.Select):
    def render(self, name, value, attrs=None, choices=()):
        self.choices = [(u&quot;&quot;, u&quot;---------&quot;)]
        if value is None:
            # if no municipality has been previously selected,
            # render either an empty list or, if a county has
            # been selected, render its municipalities
            value = ''
            model_obj = self.form_instance.instance
            if model_obj and model_obj.county_id:
                for m in model_obj.county.municipality_set.all():
                    self.choices.append((m.id, smart_text(m)))
        else:
            # if a municipality X has been selected,
            # render only these municipalities, that belong
            # to X's county
            obj = Municipality.objects.get(id=value)
            for m in Municipality.objects.filter(county=obj.county):
                self.choices.append((m.id, smart_text(m)))

        s = widgets.Select(choices=self.choices)
        select_html = s.render(name=name,value=value,attrs=attrs)

        return mark_safe(''.join(select_html))
</code></pre>
<p>Next, the form:</p>
<pre><code>class LocationForm(forms.ModelForm):
    municipality = forms.ModelChoiceField(Municipality.objects,
            widget=MunicipalityChoiceWidget(),
            label=gettext_lazy(&quot;Municipality&quot;), required=False)

    class Meta:
        model = Location
        fields = ['name', 'county', 'municipality']

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        We need access to the county field in the municipality widget, so we
        have to associate the form instance with the widget.
        &quot;&quot;&quot;
        super(LocationForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.fields['municipality'].widget.form_instance = self
</code></pre>
<p>And finally, the admin class:</p>
<pre><code>class LocationAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    form = LocationForm
    class Media:
        js = ('http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.4.0/jquery.min.js',
                '/site_media/js/municipality.js')

admin.site.register(Location, LocationAdmin)

"1672176","<p>I have a set of isoline points (or contour points) such as this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/4j92a.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/4j92a.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Each point on an isoline has its own respective X, Y, and Z coordinate. Since they are isolines, that means that each point will have a unique X-Y pair, but points on the same line will have the same Z coordinate.</p>

<p>Now, is there any algorithm or any software packages (either in C# or C++ or MATLAB) that I can use to interpolate the isoline points into a full 3-D surface?</p>

<p>P/S: I am not just interested in the final output, I am interested in getting the interpolated surface data so that I can plot the surface myself.</p>

<p><strong>Edit: C++ solutions are welcomed as well.</strong></p>
","How Do I Generate a 3-D Surface From Isolines?","<c#><matlab><interpolation>","2009-11-04 07:23:02","7396","1674574","4","<p>In MATLAB you can use either the function <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/griddata.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>griddata</code></a> or the <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/triscatteredinterp.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>TriScatteredInterp</code> class</a> (Note: as of R2013a <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/scatteredinterpolant-object.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>scatteredInterpolant</code></a> is the recommended alternative). Both of these allow you to fit a surface of regularly-spaced data to a set of nonuniformly-spaced points (although it appears <code>griddata</code> is no longer recommended in newer MATLAB versions). Here's how you can use each:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>griddata</code>:</p>

<pre><code>[XI,YI,ZI] = griddata(x,y,z,XI,YI)
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>x,y,z</code> each represent vectors of the cartesian coordinates for each point (in this case the points on the contour lines). The row vector <code>XI</code> and column vector <code>YI</code> are the cartesian coordinates at which <code>griddata</code> interpolates the values <code>ZI</code> of the fitted surface. The new values returned for the matrices <code>XI,YI</code> are the same as the result of passing <code>XI,YI</code> to <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/meshgrid.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>meshgrid</code></a> to create a uniform grid of points.</p></li>
<li><p><code>TriScatteredInterp</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>[XI,YI] = meshgrid(...);
F = TriScatteredInterp(x(:),y(:),z(:));
ZI = F(XI,YI);
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>x,y,z</code> again represent vectors of the cartesian coordinates for each point, only this time I've used a <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/colon.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">colon reshaping operation</a> <code>(:)</code> to ensure that each is a <em>column vector</em> (the required format for <code>TriScatteredInterp</code>). The interpolant <code>F</code> is then evaluated using the matrices <code>XI,YI</code> that you must create using <code>meshgrid</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Example &amp; Comparison</h2>

<p>Here's some sample code and the resulting figure it generates for reconstructing a surface from contour data using both methods above. The contour data was generated with the <a href=""https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/contour.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>contour</code></a> function:</p>

<pre><code>% First plot:

subplot(2,2,1);
[X,Y,Z] = peaks;  % Create a surface
surf(X,Y,Z);
axis([-3 3 -3 3 -8 9]);
title('Original');

% Second plot:

subplot(2,2,2);
[C,h] = contour(X,Y,Z);  % Create the contours
title('Contour map');

% Format the coordinate data for the contours:

Xc = [];
Yc = [];
Zc = [];
index = 1;
while index &lt; size(C,2)
  Xc = [Xc C(1,(index+1):(index+C(2,index)))];
  Yc = [Yc C(2,(index+1):(index+C(2,index)))];
  Zc = [Zc C(1,index).*ones(1,C(2,index))];
  index = index+1+C(2,index);
end

% Third plot:

surf(XI,YI,ZI);
axis([-3 3 -3 3 -8 9]);
title('GRIDDATA reconstruction');

% Fourth plot:

subplot(2,2,4);
F = TriScatteredInterp(Xc(:),Yc(:),Zc(:));  % Generate interpolant
ZIF = F(XI,YI);                             % Evaluate interpolant

<p>Notice that there is little difference between the two results (at least at this scale). Also notice that the interpolated surfaces have empty regions near the corners due to the sparsity of contour data at those points.</p>

"1676882","<p>I'm making a sample GUI for a new application we are developing at work.  The language has already been decided for me, but I am allowed to use any 3rd party DLLs or add-ins or whatever I need in order to make the GUI work as seamlessly as possible.</p>

<p>They want it very mac/ubuntu/vista/Windows 7-like, so I've come up with some very interesting controls and pretty GUI features.  One of which are some growing/shrinking buttons near the top of the screen that increase in size when you mouse over them (it uses the distance formula to calculate the size it needs to increase by).  When you take your mouse off of the controls, they shrink back down.  The effect looks very professional and flashy, except that there is a ghosting effect as the button shrinks back down (and the buttons to the right of it since they are fixed-at-the-hip).</p>

<p>Here is what the buttons look like in the designer:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i19.photobucket.com/albums/b151/Jrud/buttons.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>What I know:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the form didn't have a background image, I wouldn't have the ghosting problem.</li>
<li>If this were just a normal button I am drawing, I probably wouldn't have the ghosting problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>What I've done, and how I've tried to fix it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensuring the form's doublebuffering is turned on (it was)</li>
<li>Manually doublebuffering using the bufferedGraphics class (did not help or made it worse)</li>
<li>Convince the designers that it doesn't need background images or the pretty glass buttons (no go)</li>
<li>Run Invalidate() on the rectangle containing the form (did not help)</li>
<li>Run Refresh() on the form (fixed the ghosting, but now the entire screen flashes as it reloads image)</li>
<li>Sit in the corner of my cubicle and cry softly to myself (helped the stress, but also did not fix issue)</li>
</ol>

<p>What I am looking for are the answers to these questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does anyone have any idea how to get rid of the ghosting I'm describing?  Should I focus on changing the size less often? should I be focusing on buffering the background image?</li>
<li>Are there other technologies I should be using here?  Are there ActiveX controls that would be better at this than .NET user inherited ones?  Is it possible to make a DirectX user-control to use the graphics card to draw itself?</li>
<li>Is there something else I'm not thinking of here?</li>
</ol>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Update 1: 11/17/2009 9:21 AM ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>

<p>I've improved the efficiency of the draw methods by first checking to see if they need to be redrawn by checking what the new values will be vs what they already are(code changed above).  This fixes some of the ghosting, however the core problem still remains to be solved.</p>

","JQuery select an element inside a td","<jquery><css-selectors>","2009-11-04 21:55:31","98241","1676974","5","<p>Well, ""#box"" means a DOM object with the id ""box"", as in it being a unique ID. You can select that one directly. But your code suggest that you have several elements with the id ""box"" which you have to change. You should assign a class to your element inside the TD, or if it's unique by being the only DIV or SPAN in the box, you can access it like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(""table td .box"")
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the "">"" selector means that TD has to be a direct child of TABLE, and I'm assuming you have at least a TR level in between, so that won't work either. My example above matches every element with the class ""box"" inside any TD that is a child to any TABLE.</p>

<p>Obviously I would set a class on the table as well, and use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(""table.boxes td .box"")
</code></pre>

<p>Just so you don't accidentally selects things outside the scope you want to work in.</p>

"1677845","<p>I am building a CSS site and fail solving this partial problem:</p>

<p>On the left side there is a box which consists of three images. A top image, an (optional and stretched) middle image, and a bottom image.</p>

<p>I want the box to the left automatically stretch if there is more content inside. This already works for the right side with my current code.
(I put both columns into a container div and set the left box to height: 100.)</p>

<p>But now there shall also be content in the left box. This content does overflow because I set the left box to position: absolute. Thus it does not increase the size.</p>

<p>I didn't manage to get this effect without position: absolute though. I tried using float etc.</p>

<p>Here is the example code:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id=""centerwrapper""&gt;
        Header etc&lt;br/&gt;
        &lt;div id=""verticalstretcher""&gt;
            &lt;div id=""bgtop""&gt;            
                &lt;div id=""bgbottom""&gt;         
                    &lt;div id=""bgmiddle""&gt;
                    &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div id=""content""&gt;
                Content here will auto-stretch the container vertically (and the box to the left!)
            &lt;/div&gt;  
        &lt;/div&gt;
        Footer etc&lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With this stylesheet:</p>

<pre><code>#centerwrapper {
    width: 500px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
#verticalstretcher {
    position: relative;
    min-height: 280px; /* Sum of the top and bottom image height */
    width: 100%;
    background-color: orange;   
}
#bgtop {
    position: absolute;
    width: 185px; /* width of the bg images */
    height: 100%;
    background: url(css/img/bg_navi_left_top.gif) no-repeat;
}
#bgbottom {
    position: absolute;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background: url(css/img/bg_navi_left_bottom.gif) bottom no-repeat;              
}
#bgmiddle {
    position: absolute;
    width: 100%;
    top: 250px; /* Don't cover top GIF */
    bottom: 15px; /* Don't cover bottom GIF */
    background-color: yellow; /* Repeated image here */             
}
#content {
    margin-left: 200px; /* Start the text right from the box */
}
</code></pre>

<p>It looks like this (Colored it for better understanding):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/xw5a1.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/xw5a1.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>The yellow part is actually a stretched image, I left it out for the example, it works as expected.</p>

<p>How can I add text into the left box that will also stretch it? Or is it possible with TABLE instead of CSS at this point?</p>

"1678068","<p>I would like to understand why on .NET there are nine integer types: <code>Char</code>, <code>Byte</code>, <code>SByte</code>, <code>Int16</code>, <code>UInt16</code>, <code>Int32</code>, <code>UInt32</code>, <code>Int64</code>, and <code>UInt64</code>; plus other numeric types: <code>Single</code>, <code>Double</code>, <code>Decimal</code>; and all these types have no relation at all.</p>

<p>When I first started coding in C# I thought ""cool, there's a <code>uint</code> type, I'm going to use that when negative values are not allowed"". Then I realized no API used <code>uint</code> but <code>int</code> instead, and that <code>uint</code> is not derived from <code>int</code>, so a conversion was needed.</p>

<p>What are the real world application of these types? Why not have, instead, <code>integer</code> and <code>positiveInteger</code> ? These are types I can understand. A person's age in years is a <code>positiveInteger</code>, and since <code>positiveInteger</code> is a subset of <code>integer</code> there's so need for conversion whenever <code>integer</code> is expected.</p>

<p>The following is a diagram of the type hierarchy in XPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0. If you look under <code>xs:anyAtomicType</code> you can see the numeric hierarchy <code>decimal</code> > <code>integer</code> > <code>long</code> > <code>int</code> > <code>short</code> > <code>byte</code>. Why wasn't .NET designed like this? Will the new framework ""Oslo"" be any different?</p>

There are (perhaps surprisingly) many times when you care that a <code>UInt32</code> is a 4 bytes big and unsigned, so a <code>UInt32</code> <b>is not</b> a kind of <code>Int32</code>, nor is an <code>Int32</code> a type of  <code>Int64</code>.</p>

<p>And you almost always care about the difference between an <code>int</code> and a <code>float</code>.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, inheritance &amp; the class hierarchy are not the same as mathematical set inclusion.  The fact that the values a <code>UInt32</code> can hold are a strict subset of the values an <code>Int64</code> can hold does not mean that a <code>UInt32</code> is a type of <code>Int64</code>.  Less obviously, an <code>Int32</code> is not a type of <code>Int64</code> - even though there's no conceptual difference between them, their underlying representations are different (4 bytes versus 8 bytes).  <code>Decimals</code> are even more different.</p>

<p>XPath is different: the representations for all the numeric types are fundamentally the same - a string of ASCII digits.  There, the difference between a <code>short</code> and a <code>long</code> is one of <i>possible</i> range rather than representation - ""123"" is both a valid representation of a <code>short</code> and a valid representation of a <code>long</code> with the same value.</p>

"1678637","<p>I have a Core Data model which consists of a simple tree of a particular entity, which has two relationships, <code>parent</code> and <code>children</code>. I have an <code>NSTreeController</code> managing the model, with an <code>NSOutlineView</code> bound to the <code>NSTreeController</code>.</p>

<p>My problem is that I need a single root object, but this should not display in the outline view, only its children should be displayed at the top level of the outline view. If I set the fetch predicate of the <code>NSTreeController</code> in Interface Builder to <code>parent == nil</code>, everything works fine except the root item is visible as the top level item in the outline view.</p>

<p>My entity has an attribute, <code>isRootItem</code>, that is true for the root item only.</p>

<p>If I set the fetch predicate of the tree controller to <code>parent.isRootItem == 1</code>, this displays the tree correctly, but as soon as I add a new item to the top level it fails because the tree controller does not assign the ""invisible"" root item as the parent of the new item.</p>

","Object allocation from class method?","<objective-c><cocoa>","2009-11-05 16:16:43","2276","1682095","4","<p>According to naming conventions, you should call it <code>+dataPoint</code>.  The reason the analyzer is barfing at you is because (by convention), a class method that uses ""new"" is expected to return an object with a +1 retain count.  You're returning an object with a +0 (autoreleased) retain count, and are therefore breaking convention.</p>

<p>As was alluded to in @Peter's answer, to create an empty object, it's usually done with <code>[ClassName className]</code> methods.  Ex:  <code>[NSArray array]</code>, <code>[NSData data]</code>, <code>[NSString string]</code>, etc.  So the proper thing for you to do would be to rename it <code>[DataPoint dataPoint]</code> and then implement it as <code>return [[[self alloc] init] autorelease];</code></p>

<p>Using <code>[self alloc]</code> is preferable, since it translates down to subclasses.  IE, if you create a MutableDataPoint subclass, then (if you use <code>[self alloc]</code>) doing <code>[MutableDataPoint dataPoint]</code> returns a <code>MutableDataPoint</code>, whereas if you leave it as <code>[DataPoint alloc]</code>, it would come back as a <code>DataPoint</code> object (because that's what you're allocating).  (On a side note, <code>self</code> refers to the object being operated on in the context of the method.  For instance methods, it's the instance.  For class methods, it's the <code>Class</code> object itself)</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>If you do want the class method to return an object with a +1 retain count, then (by convention), you'd just need to call it <code>+new</code> (ie, <code>DataPoint * p = [DataPoint new];</code>).  However, use of the <code>+new</code> method seems to have fallen into more-or-less disuse, with <code>+alloc/-init...</code> or a class convenience method being the favorable alternatives.</p>

<p>Edit #2 (Re: Edit_003):</p>

<p>I personally prefer the former (<code>+dataPoint</code>), but only because <code>+new</code> isn't as common and I don't have to remember to <code>-release</code> the object.  Either one is perfectly acceptable and correct, though.</p>

I've read the related posts on this forum - mainly <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60871/how-to-solve-memory-fragmentation"">this</a> one.  And I still have some questions.</p>
<p>I've been using a memory space <a href=""http://hashpling.org/asm/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">profiler</a> to get a picture of the memory.  I wrote a 1 line program that contains cin &gt;&gt; var; and took a picture of the memory:</p>
<p><img src=""https://img22.imageshack.us/img22/6808/memoryk.gif"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>
<p>Where on the top arc - green indicates empty space, yellow allocated, red commited.  My question is what is that allocated memory on the right?  Is it the stack for the main thread?  This memory isn't going to be freed and it splits the continuous memory that I need.  In this simple 1 line program the split isn't as bad.  My actual program has more stuff allocated right in the middle of the address space, and I don't know where it's comming from.  I'm not allocating that memory yet.</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li><p>How can I try solve this?  I was thinking of switching to something like nedmalloc or dlmalloc.  However that would only apply to the objects I allocate explicitly myself, whereas the split shown in the picture wouldn't go away?  Or is there a way to replace the CRT allocation with another memory manager?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Speaking of objects, are there any wrappers for nedmalloc for c++ so I can use new and delete to allocate objects?</p>

<p>Typically, thin slices at fixed points in the address space are caused by linked dlls loading at their preferred address. The ones that load high up in the address space tend to be Microsoft operating system dlls. It's more efficient for the operating system if these can all be loaded at their preferred addresses because then the read-only parts of the dlls can all be shared between processes.</p>

<p>The slice that you can see is nothing to worry about, it barely cuts anything out of your address space. As you've noted, there are dlls, though, which load at other points in the address space. IIRC <code>shlwapi.dll</code> is a particularly bad example, loading at about 0x2000000 (again IIRC) which often splits a large portion of the available address space into two smaller pieces. The problem with this is that once the DLL is loaded, there is nothing that you can do to move this allocate space around.</p>

<p>If you link against the DLL (either directly or via another DLL), there is nothing that you can do. If you use <code>LoadLibrary</code> you can get sneaky and reserve its preferred address, forcing it to be relocated - frequently somewhere better in the address space - before releasing that reserved memory. This doesn't always work, though.</p>

<p>Under the hood, Address Space Monitor uses <code>VirtualQueryEx</code> to examine the address space of the process but there is another call from the psapi library which other tools use (e.g. <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Process Explorer</a>) which can show you which files (including DLLs) are mapped into which parts of the address space.</p>

<p>As you've found, it can be scarily easy to run out of room in a 2GB user address space. Fundamentally, you're best defence against memory fragmentation is simply to not require any large contiguous blocks of memory. Although difficult to retro-fit, designing your applicationg to work with 'medium sized' chunks usually makes substantially more efficient usage of the address space.</p>

<p>Similarly you can use a  paging strategy, possibly using memory mapped files or <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366527%28VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Address Windowing Extensions</a>.</p>

<p>If you like the widgets that the Django Admin application uses, feel free to use them in your own application! They’re all stored in django.contrib.admin.widgets.</p>

<p>In this case, you want the <code>FilteredSelectMultiple</code> widget. To use it, apply the widget on a form field like so:</p>
<pre><code>my_field = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(queryset=MyModel.objects.all(), widget=FilteredSelectMultiple(&quot;verbose name&quot;, is_stacked=False))
</code></pre>
<p>Make sure to include the forms <code>media</code> in the template as it needs to include a few JS files.</p>

"1702315","<p>Morning stackers! So my question today isn't dealing with any code, but how to go about this the correct way from the start. I have a video player built to a static size (max: 800x600) which I'll have to re-code every time I need it to be a different size.</p>

<p>What I need it to do in the near future is dynamically resize itself and all the elements inside of it based on 1 width variable that it will received either from HTML or XML.</p>

<p><strong>Now to me there are 2 ways to go about this:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Start with the smallest size possible and resize upwards, but I'm unsure of how the Flash movie will actually expand upwards as of right now.</li>
<li>Or 2, start with the largest size possible (in this case 800x600) and size everything down.</li>
</ul>

<p>Step 1, I think seems to be the better way to go about this (ala YouTube style), but Step 2 also seems like it could be the easier way? A friend of mine mentioned that I should go with the larger size and have elements resize in each class, then fix to the upper left hand corner. However for the player to fit inside of certain div columns on sites, blogs whatever he said that there will have to be an HTML/CSS side of this... meaning that the div containing the resized flash player will have to cover up the areas of the Flash movie that are not to be shown? Is that possible to put a 800x600 flash movie into a div that smaller then 800 pixels wide? And cover it up with another div?</p>

<p><strong>Anyways, my mission is to be able to have a dynamically sized player like this:</strong></p>

What you're trying to accomplish is a simple full width and height layout aligned to the top left with no scaling. First you need to tell flash exactly that with these two lines at the top of frame one or in the constructor of you document class:</p>

<pre><code>stage.scaleMode = StageScaleMode.NO_SCALE;
stage.align =  StageAlign.TOP_LEFT;
</code></pre>

<p>then you just need to position your display objects using the width and height values you pass in to your swf. Starting big or starting small don't really have anything to do with it since you're really trying to make it dimension agnostic. You're going to have to make layout decisions built into your code that are triggered by various dimension combinations.</p>

Turns out that the width of my center content margin was dictated by margins instead of just a direct width (ie. 500px).  So whenever the page was resized, the margins on the sides of the browser tried to stay as they were, thus making the entire column smaller.  I just had to get rid of the margins and specify where I wanted the column to sit on the page and just justify a width for it.</p>

<p>…and <code>drawRect</code> is called with the correct size. In a way, this makes sense, because <code>UITableViewCell</code>'s <code>initWithStyle:reuseIdentifier:</code> makes no mention of the size of the cell, and only the table view actually knows how big each row is going to be, based on its own size and its delegate's response to <code>tableView:heightForRowAtIndexPath:</code>.</p>

"1704872","<p>I have a <code>WebView</code> that I'm using to open some files stored in the <code>assets/</code> directory of my project. It works fine for most of the files, but there's one in particular (and I'm sure others I haven't found) that it just <strong>will not</strong> open. </p>

<p>The file I'm having problems with is named: </p>

<pre><code>""assets/ContentRoot/Photos/XXX Software Logo - jpg - 75%.JPG""

<pre><code>""file:///android_asset/ContentRoot/Photos/XXX%20Software%20Logo%20-%20jpg%20-%2075%.JPG""

<p>Neither of these URLs were able to open the file (and they both look okay to me). Anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> If I encode the <code>%</code> by hand (using <code>%25</code>, as commonsware.com suggested) then it loads the image, but it tries to parse it as text, not as an image, so I just get a lot of (basically) garbage.</p>

After you call SetExpressCheckout, you'll get a token back that represents the checkout you're performing.  You'll need to use that token and redirect the user to Paypal to approve the payment.  After they approve it, Paypal will redirect back to your site and then you can call GetExpressCheckoutDetails and/or DoExpressCheckoutPayment.  The GetExpressCheckoutDetails call is useful for getting things like shipping address, etc, since the buyer can set that stuff as part of the approval flow.  Once you have all the info you need, the buyer has approved the payment and you're ready to get paid, then call DoExpressCheckoutPayment to get your money.</p>

"1707620","<p>I've been implementing an adaptation of <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=6119571473300502765"" rel=""noreferrer"">Viola-Jones' face detection algorithm</a>. The technique relies upon placing a subframe of 24x24 pixels within an image, and subsequently placing rectangular features inside it in every position with every size possible.</p>

<p>These features can consist of two, three or four rectangles. The following example is presented.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/5MKl7.png"" alt=""Rectangle features""></p>

<p>They claim the exhaustive set is more than 180k (section 2):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given that the base resolution of the detector is 24x24, the exhaustive set of rectangle features is quite large, over 180,000 . Note that unlike the Haar basis, the set of rectangle
  features is overcomplete.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following statements are not explicitly stated in the paper, so they are assumptions on my part:</p>

<ol>
<li>There are only 2 two-rectangle features, 2 three-rectangle features and 1 four-rectangle feature. The logic behind this is that we are observing the <em>difference</em> between the highlighted rectangles, not explicitly the color or luminance or anything of that sort.</li>
<li>We cannot define feature type A as a 1x1 pixel block; it must at least be at least 1x2 pixels. Also, type D must be at least 2x2 pixels, and this rule holds accordingly to the other features.</li>
<li>We cannot define feature type A as a 1x3 pixel block as the middle pixel cannot be partitioned, and subtracting it from itself is identical to a 1x2 pixel block; this feature type is only defined for even widths. Also, the width of feature type C must be divisible by 3, and this rule holds accordingly to the other features.</li>
<li>We cannot define a feature with a width and/or height of 0. Therefore, we iterate <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> to 24 minus the size of the feature.</li>
</ol>

<p>Based upon these assumptions, I've counted the exhaustive set:</p>

<pre><code>const int frameSize = 24;
const int features = 5;
// All five feature types:
const int feature[features][2] = {{2,1}, {1,2}, {3,1}, {1,3}, {2,2}};

int count = 0;
// Each feature:
for (int i = 0; i &lt; features; i++) {
    int sizeX = feature[i][0];
    int sizeY = feature[i][1];
    // Each position:
    for (int x = 0; x &lt;= frameSize-sizeX; x++) {
        for (int y = 0; y &lt;= frameSize-sizeY; y++) {
            // Each size fitting within the frameSize:
            for (int width = sizeX; width &lt;= frameSize-x; width+=sizeX) {
                for (int height = sizeY; height &lt;= frameSize-y; height+=sizeY) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The result is <strong>162,336</strong>.</p>

<p>The only way I found to approximate the ""over 180,000"" Viola &amp; Jones speak of, is dropping assumption #4 and by introducing bugs in the code. This involves changing four lines respectively to:</p>

<pre><code>for (int width = 0; width &lt; frameSize-x; width+=sizeX)
for (int height = 0; height &lt; frameSize-y; height+=sizeY)
</code></pre>

<p>The result is then <strong>180,625</strong>. (Note that this will effectively prevent the features from ever touching the right and/or bottom of the subframe.)</p>

<p>Now of course the question: have they made a mistake in their implementation? Does it make any sense to consider features with a surface of zero? Or am I seeing it the wrong way?</p>

"1711784","<p>I'm currently working on writing a version of the MATLAB <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/regionprops.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RegionProps</a> function for <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GNU Octave</a>.  I have most of it implemented, but I'm still struggling with the implementation of a few parts.  I had <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1532168/what-are-the-second-moments-of-a-region"">previously asked</a> about the <em>second central moments</em> of a region.</p>

<p>This was helpful theoretically, but I'm having trouble actually implementing the suggestions.  I get results wildly different from MATLAB's (or common sense for that matter) and really don't understand why.</p>

<p>Consider this test image:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/nVn1B.png"" alt=""Slanting ellipse.""></p>

<p>We can see it slants at 45 degrees from the X axis, with minor and major axes of 30 and 100 respectively.  </p>

<p>Running it through MATLAB's <code>RegionProps</code> function confirms this:</p>

<pre><code>MajorAxisLength: 101.3362
MinorAxisLength: 32.2961
Eccentricity: 0.9479
Orientation: -44.9480
</code></pre>

<p>Meanwhile, I don't even get the axes right. I'm trying to use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_moments#Central_moments"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">these formulas</a> from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>My code so far is:</p>

<h3>raw_moments.m:</h3>

<pre><code>function outmom = raw_moments(im,i,j)

  total = 0;
  total = int32(total);
  im = int32(im);

  [height,width] = size(im);

  for x = 1:width;
     for y = 1:height;
        amount = (x ** i) * (y ** j) * im(y,x);
        total = total + amount;
     end;
  end;

  outmom = total;
</code></pre>

<h3>central_moments.m:</h3>

<pre><code>function cmom = central_moments(im,p,q);

  total = 0;
  total = double(total);
  im = int32(im);

  rawm00 = raw_moments(im,0,0);

  xbar = double(raw_moments(im,1,0)) / double(rawm00);
  ybar = double(raw_moments(im,0,1)) / double(rawm00);

  [height,width] = size(im);

  for x = 1:width;
    for y = 1:height;
      amount = ((x - xbar) ** p) *  ((y - ybar) ** q) * double(im(y,x));
      total = total + double(amount);
    end;
  end;

  cmom = double(total);
</code></pre>

<p>And here's my code attempting to use these.  I include comments for the values I get
at each step:</p>

<pre><code>inim = logical(imread('135deg100by30ell.png'));

cm00 = central_moments(inim,0,0);          % 2567

up20 = central_moments(inim,2,0) / cm00;   % 353.94
up02 = central_moments(inim,0,2) / cm00;   % 352.89
up11 = central_moments(inim,1,1) / cm00;   % 288.31

covmat = [up20, up11; up11, up02];
%[ 353.94  288.31
%  288.31  352.89 ]

eigvals = eig(covmat);          % [65.106 641.730]

minoraxislength = eigvals(1);   % 65.106
majoraxislength = eigvals(2);   % 641.730
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong.  I seem to be following those formulas correctly, but my results are nonsense.  I haven't found any obvious errors in my moment functions, although honestly my understanding of moments isn't the greatest to begin with.</p>

<p>Can anyone see where I'm going astray?  Thank you very much.</p>

Given such a binary mask <code>BW</code> of a convex quadrilateral, what would be the most efficient way to determine the four corners?</p>

<p>E.g.,</p>

<p><strong>Best Solution so far:</strong>
Use <code>edge</code> to find the bounding lines, the Hough transform to find the 4 lines in the edge image and then find the intersection points of those 4 lines or use a corner detector on the edge image. Seems complicated, and I can't help feeling there's a simpler solution out there. </p>

<p>Btw, <code>convhull</code> doesn't always return 4 points (maybe someone can suggest <code>qhull</code> options to prevent that) : it returns a few points along the edges as well.</p>

But there could be multiple ""corners"" at each real corner since the peaks aren't unique. I could cluster them based on <strong>θ</strong> and average the ""corners"" around a real corner but the main problem is the use of <code>order(1:10)</code>. </p>

<p>Is <code>10</code> enough to account for all the corners or will this exclude a ""corner"" at a real corner?</p>

<p>Note that I start by extracting the edges, getting the boundary, then converting it to signature.  Finally we find the points on the boundary that are furthest from the centroid, those points constitute the corners found. (Alternatively we can also detect peaks in the signature for corners).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
In response to Jacob's comment, I should explain that I first tried to find the peaks in the signature using first/second derivatives, but ended up taking the furthest N-points. 10 was just an ad-hoc value, and would be difficult to generalize (I tried taking 4 same as number of corners, but it didn't cover all of them). I think the idea of clustering them to remove duplicates is worth looking into.</p>

<p>As far as I see it, the problem with the 1st approach was that if you plot <code>rho</code> without taking <code>θ</code> into account, you will get a different shape (not the same peaks), since the <em>speed</em> by which we trace the boundary is different and depends on the curvature. If we could figure out how to <em>normalize</em> that effect, we can get more accurate results using derivatives.</p>

<p>This will obviously have more information but I'm just trying to get the basics working for now. I set up a composition and am using XML Downloader to load the above XML file from the filesystem.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is thus: when I use the Structure Key Member patch on an element with multiple children, I get back multiple children BUT when I use Structure Key Member on an element with just one child I get back the single child instead of a collection of 1 item.</p>

<p>I've illustrated the problem below in an example composition:</p>

"1719267","<p>With RAM typically in the Gigabytes on all PC's now, should I be spending time hunting down all the small (non-growing) memory leaks that may be in my program? I'm talking about those holes that may be less than 64 bytes, or even a bunch that are just 4 bytes.</p>
<p>Some of these are very difficult to identify because they are not in my own code, but may be in third party code or in the development tool's code, and I may not even have direct access to the source. In those cases, it would involve lengthy communication with the vendors of these products.</p>

<p>While any error in your application is always bad, there are types of errors, which can be not visible in certain environments. For example, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_leak"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">memory or resources leaks</a> errors are relatively harmless on client machines and <a href=""https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040317-00/?p=40223"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">can be deadly on servers</a>.</p>

","Do Small Memory Leaks Matter Anymore?","<memory-leaks>","2009-11-12 01:23:35","5038","1719330","17","<p>This is completely a personal decision.</p>

<p>However, if:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the question I am really asking is, if I know I have a program that leaks, say 40 bytes every time it is run, does that matter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this case, I'd say no.  The memory will be reclaimed when the program terminates, so if it's only leaking 40 bytes <strong>one time</strong> during the operation of an executable, that's practically meaningless.</p>

<p>If, however, it's leaking 40 bytes repeatedly, each time you do some operation, that might be more meaningful.  The longer running the application, the more significant that becomes.</p>

<p>I would say, though, that fixing memory leaks often is worthwhile, even if the leak is a ""meaningless"" leak.  Memory leaks are typically indicators of some underlying problem, so understanding and correcting the leak will often make your program more reliable over time.</p>

<p>The problem is that when one of the instances switch over to playing a new FLV, then some of the other instances ""glitch out""! See this image for what the glitch looks like:</p>

<p>This glitch also happens when they first start playing (first load).</p>

<p>More details of Flash:</p>

<ul>
<li>24fps</li>
<li>FlashPlayer 10</li>
<li>Actionscript 3</li>

<p>More details of the FLVs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encoded with On2 VP6</li>
<li>24fps</li>
<li>transparent background (alpha channel)</li>
<li>dimensions 640x480</li>
<li>filesize are about 150KB each</li>
<li>FLVs are imported using option: ""Embed video in SWF and play in timeline""</li>
</ul>

<p>Has anyone seen this before? Does anyone have a reason for why this might be happening? And any possibly ways to stop it from happening.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT*</strong>
It seems to only ""glitch"" when an FLV is started from a random frame (a frame that is not the first frame). I don't think it always does it, but it does it quite often.</p>

"1730731","<p>I've successfully created an app that minimizes to the tray using a NotifyIcon. When the form is manually closed it is successfully hidden from the desktop, taskbar, and alt-tab. The problem occurs when trying to start with the app minimized. At first the problem was that the app would be minimized but would still appear in the alt-tab dialog. Changing the FormBorderStyle to one of the ToolWindow options (from the ""None"" option) fixed this, but introduced another problem. When the app first starts the titlebar of the minimized window is visible just above the start menu:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/FwfAW.gif"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/FwfAW.gif"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Opening the form and the closing it causes it to hide properly. I've tried lots of variations, but here's essentially how it's working right now...</p>

<p>WindowState is set to Minimized in the Designer. After some initialization in the constructor I have the following lines:</p>

<pre><code>this.Visible = false;
this.ShowInTaskbar = false;
</code></pre>

<p>When the NotifyIcon is double-clicked I have the following:</p>

<pre><code> this.WindowState = FormWindowState.Normal;
 this.Visible = true;
 this.ShowInTaskbar = true;
</code></pre>

<p>Like I said, I've tried lots of minor variations on this (this.Hide(), etc.). Is there a way to have the NotifyIcon be the primary component such that I can completely start and dispose of the form while leaving the NotifyIcon running? There's got to be a way to start the app with the form minimized without any of the weirdness. Please help me find it!</p>

    private void exitToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {
        allowClose = true;
        Application.Exit();

<p>Note a wrinkle with the Load event, it won't fire until the main form is first shown.  So be sure to do initialization in the form's constructor, not the Load event handler.</p>

<p>I will use a simple div element, with the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> that the animated image will have, the png sprite as <code>background-image</code>  and <code>background-repeat</code> set to <code>no-repeat</code></p>

<p><strong>CSS Needed:</strong></p>

<pre><code>#anim {
  width: 14px; height: 14px;
  background-image: url(https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/im/emotisprites/wink2.png);
  background-repeat: no-repeat; 
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Markup needed:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""anim""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The trick is basically to scroll the background image sprite up, using the <code>background-position</code> CSS property.</p>

<p>We need to know the <code>height</code> of the animated image (to know how much we will scroll up each time) and how many times to scroll (how many <em>frames</em> will have the animation).</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript implementation:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var scrollUp = (function () {
  var timerId; // stored timer in case you want to use clearInterval later

  return function (height, times, element) {
    var i = 0; // a simple counter
    timerId = setInterval(function () {
      if (i &gt; times) // if the last frame is reached, set counter to zero
        i = 0;
      element.style.backgroundPosition = ""0px -"" + i * height + 'px'; //scroll up
      i++;
    }, 100); // every 100 milliseconds
  };
})();

// start animation:
scrollUp(14, 42, document.getElementById('anim'))
</code></pre>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> You can also set the CSS properties programmatically so you don't have to define any style on your page, and make a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Guide/Creating_New_Objects/Using_a_Constructor_Function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">constructor function</a> from the above example, that will allow you to show multiple sprite animations simultaneously:</p>

<p><strong>Usage:</strong></p>

<pre><code>var wink = new SpriteAnim({
  width: 14,
  height: 14,
  frames: 42,
  sprite: ""https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/im/emotisprites/wink2.png"",
  elementId : ""anim1""
});

var monkey = new SpriteAnim({
  width: 18,
  height: 14,
  frames: 90,
  sprite: ""https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/im/emotisprites/monkey1.png"",
  elementId : ""anim4""
});
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Implementation:</strong></p>

<pre><code>function SpriteAnim (options) {
  var timerId, i = 0,
      element = document.getElementById(options.elementId);

  element.style.width = options.width + ""px"";
  element.style.height = options.height + ""px"";
  element.style.backgroundRepeat = ""no-repeat"";
  element.style.backgroundImage = ""url("" + options.sprite + "")"";

  timerId = setInterval(function () {
    if (i &gt;= options.frames) {
      i = 0;
    }
    element.style.backgroundPosition = ""0px -"" + i * options.height + ""px"";
     i++;
  }, 100);

  this.stopAnimation = function () {
    clearInterval(timerId);
  };
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that I added a <code>stopAnimation</code> method, so you can later stop a specified animation just by calling it, for example:</p>

<p><strong>What's wrong</strong> - disabled Delphi IDE toolbar and menu buttons are ugly black/white images.<br />
<strong>What I want to do</strong> - make them look gray-scaled.</p>

<p><strong>How?</strong> I made some research. Main problem in virtual <code>TCustomImageList.DoDraw</code> method. When paramater <code>Enabled = False</code> it paints ugly things (see disabled buttons on screenshot). I created my own override for this function and it paints gray-scaled images when <code>Enabled = False</code></p>

<p>Now I want to <strong><em>replace default <code>DoDraw</code> with my own</em></strong> in IDE (using design-time package):</p>

<ol>
<li>I figured out that unit ImgList is compiled-in bds.exe, so trick with patching this function in <code>rtlXXX.bpl</code> will not work. </li>
<li>Searching for function's body content gave no result. Looks like bds.exe's implementation (I'm talikng about machine codes) of <code>DoDraw</code> is a bit different.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any suggestions or ideas of how can I make this possible? As base example of runtime code patching I took Andy's Midas Speed Fix: <code>FindMethodPtr</code>, <code>HookProc</code>, <code>UnhookProc</code></p>

"1743331","<p>I need a functionality to have optional columns in a LINQ to SQL definition. So that LINQ to SQL normally ignores this column within selects and updates etc.
But if a select contains a value for this column it should use this value.</p>
<p>Long version:</p>
<h2>The Scenario</h2>
<p>I've the following tables:<br />
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/i1PhY.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>
<p>If Field.FieldViews.Count() greater than 0 than should this field be visible.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>If I check the visibility as mentioned above with:</p>
<pre><code>Field.FieldViews.Count()
</code></pre>
<p>Than it makes a single query to the database for every field.
So in my project sometimes up to 1000x</p>
<h2>My Solution</h2>
<p>I wrote a stored procedure:</p>
<pre><code> SELECT
   f.*,
   (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [fieldViews] v WHERE v.fieldId = f.fieldId) AS Visible
  FROM [fields] f
  WHERE
   f.X BETWEEN @xFrom AND @xTo AND
   f.Y BETWEEN @yFrom AND @yTo
</code></pre>
<p>To use this additional column I added the following code:</p>
<pre><code> public partial class Field
  {
   private bool visible = false;
 
   [Column(Storage = &quot;Visible&quot;, DbType = &quot;INT&quot;)]
   public bool Visible
   {
    get
    {
     return visible;
    }
    set
    {
     visible = value;
    }
   }
  }
</code></pre>
<p><strong>This works just fine.</strong></p>
<p>But ...</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>If I fetch entries from Fields table without the stored procedure:</p>
<pre><code>from d in DataContext.Fields select d;
</code></pre>
<p>I got the following error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>Bad Storage property: 'Visible' on member 'Models.Field.Visible'.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I added the column &quot;Visible&quot; to the database table:</p>
<pre><code>ALTER TABLE dbo.Fields ADD
 Visible int NOT NULL CONSTRAINT DF_Fields_Visible DEFAULT 0
</code></pre>
<p><strong>With this I could solve the error mentioned above.</strong></p>
<p>But …</p>
<h3>Next problem</h3>
<p>I have fetched some Field objects using the stored procedure.
Now I make some changes to some of these objects.
If I now try to submit these changes it doesn't work. Looking at the generated query unveils the reason:</p>
<pre><code> UPDATE [dbo].[Fields]
 SET [X] = @p3
 WHERE ([FieldId] = @p0) AND ([X] = @p1) AND ([Y] = @p2) AND ([Visible] = 3)
</code></pre>
<p>The problem here is, that it uses the &quot;Visible&quot; column in the where statement. But the &quot;Visible&quot; column is always 0.
Visible is only greater than 0 if I fetch data using the stored procedure...</p>
<h2>What I need</h2>
<p>Something like the ColumnAttribute where the column is not required</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>a way to remove a column from the where statement when updating.</p>

"1744348","<p>I'm working a small qt app (using PyQt4) and I've come up with an idea but I'm unsure as to how to implement it. I have a QTableView that represents some data and I'd like to add another column to the QTableView that contains a checkbox control that could be wired up to some piece of the model. For example, something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/web/library/wa-custmtag/screen_3.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Note the Delete column has a checkbox widget for each row (although this is a web app, not a desktop Qt app, the principal is the same). Bonus points if I can select multiple rows, right click, and choose ""Check/Uncheck Selected"".</p>

<p>If any of this is unclear, drop a comment here and I'll clarify.</p>
","Embedding a control in a QTableView?","<python><qt><pyqt4><tableview>","2009-11-16 19:34:53","4663","1746130","3","<p>Implementing your own table model is more work than using <code>QStandardItemModel</code> (as @Andy recommends), but it does give you a fine control over what you want to do, so I'll try to give you a summary of what to do.  I assume you know all about <a href=""https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Qt's documentation</a> and <a href=""http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/classes.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PyQt's class documentation</a> and can look up whatever classes you need.  (I may be overexplaining if you already have a <code>QTableView</code> but better than leaving something out, I think.)</p>

<p>To get checkable states:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a subclass of <code>QTableModel</code>.

<ul>
<li>Select some data structure to store the contents of your rows.  This can be pretty simple (a big internal list), or as complex as a SQL database (in which case see <code>QSqlTableModel</code> instead).</li>
<li>Override <code>rowCount</code>, <code>columnCount</code>, <code>data</code>, and <code>setData</code>.

<ul>
<li><code>rowCount</code> and <code>columnCount</code> correspond fairly directly to what you use for a data model.  If you basically are using a 2D array (or list of lists), they can be as short as one-liners.</li>
<li><code>data</code> is where things get interesting.  Item models store several different fields (which Qt calls <em>roles</em>) and what <code>data</code> returns depends on what role is being asked for.  Note that I talk about the data types of what's returned but it always needs to be wrapped into <code>QVariant</code>.

<ul>
<li><code>Qt.DisplayRole</code> is whatever text is displayed in the cells of the table.  This is your actual data, and is by far the common case (so that this is the default role).</li>
<li><code>Qt.CheckStateRole</code> is a boolean.  Returning <code>Qt.Checked</code> will display a checked check-box, and <code>Qt.Unchecked</code> will return an unchecked one.  If all you want a column to contain is check-boxes only handle this role.</li>
<li>The other roles are useful for icons, for background colors, and a number of other features but these.</li>
<li>Any unhandled role should return a <code>QVariant</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>setData</code> is symmetric to <code>data</code>.  You should handle the roles you handle in <code>data</code>: <code>Qt.DisplayRole</code> for the actual data, and <code>Qt.CheckStateRole</code> for the checkboxes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>To allow multiple selection of rows and columns and cells.  To do that you want to understand <a href=""https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/model-view-programming.html#handling-selections-in-item-views"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">selection models</a>.  The short version is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set the <em>selection mode</em> on your table view: <code>view.setSelectionMode( QAbstractItemView.ContiguousSelection</code>).  This will let you highlight contiguous cells.  You can highlight arbitrary cells as well: see <code>QAbstractView.SelectionMode</code>.</li>
<li>To determine which cells are actually selected following an action ask the table view for its <em>selection model</em> (note the <strong>'l'</strong>): <code>view.selectionModel().selectedIndexes()</code>.  You can iterate through these with a <code>for</code> loop.</li>
</ul>

<p>To allow right-clicking:</p>

<ul>
<li>Override your view's <code>contextMenuEvent</code>.</li>
<li>Create a <code>QMenu</code> and connect it to whatever slots you need.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a more in-depth understanding read the <a href=""https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/model-view-programming.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Qt guide to Model/View</a> if you haven't already.  And definitely look at the <a href=""https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/examples-itemviews.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Qt item view examples</a>.  Many of the ones describe are implemented in PyQt in much less code (including the two @Jesse mentions), and the tree model examples carry over to tables but with much less work (you need to implement much less, as described above.)</p>

<p>Basically draws a window with a pretty gradient background, using a HeaderedContentControl to create the title bar, which uses a HeaderTemplate to put the x button there.</p>

<p>Like so:</p>

<p>However, as you can see, I've tried binding the command of the X (close) button to the CloseCommand in my ViewModel. Assuming my ViewModel is correct and that my lack of understanding of the WPF databinding stuff is the problem, what am I doing wrong? Can it not be done the way I'm trying?</p>

<p>(Note: For the purposes of this question I merged all resources in use by the window into the windows resource dictionary.)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Since Sam suggested my DataContext for my window isn't set, I'll clarify that it is set, but done in the code behind for App.Xaml when it creates the MainWindow.</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Interaction logic for App.xaml
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public partial class App : Application
{
    protected override void OnStartup(StartupEventArgs e)
    {
        base.OnStartup(e);

        MainWindow mainWindow = new MainWindow();            
        var viewModel = new MainWindowViewModel();

        viewModel.RequestClose += (s, ev) =&gt; mainWindow.Close();

        mainWindow.DataContext = viewModel;

        mainWindow.Show();
    }
}

<p>Except I would like to have nothing to the left of the progress bar, and a cancel button on the right.</p>

<p>I've fiddled around with code, trying to do this, but I've never worked with the toolbar of a nav controller before, so I'm unsure of where to start.</p>

<p><strong>Does anyone know I might go about doing this, or where I could find resources explaining how to do this?</strong></p>

<p>I've read over the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/DOCUMENTATION/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/ApplicationControls/ApplicationControls.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH13-SW7"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Human Interface Guide</a>, the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UINavigationController_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006934-CH3-SW30"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UINavigationController class reference</a>, and the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/featuredarticles/ViewControllerPGforiPhoneOS/NavigationControllers/NavigationControllers.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007457-CH103-SW4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">View Controller Programming Guide</a>, but they only show how to do very basic toolbar layouts, with simple buttons and segmented controls.</p>

"1758484","<p>I'm creating a website for my schools ""Math Relay"" competition.</p>

<p>I have a ""Container"" div (with a white background), then a top-bar, left-bar, and right-bar div inside the container.</p>

<p>left-bar and right-bar are both floated inside ""Container"".</p>

<p>However, if you look in the image below you can see the right-bar has the grey background showing beneath it.  If ""Container"" is truly containing both top, left and right bar then it should be the containers background which shows through and the bottom should all be at a uniform level with a white color.</p>

<p>Instead, it seems that container isn't fully containing the left &amp; right bar and therefore the actual body background shows through on the bottom of the right bar.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/DuCXf.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Here is my CSS:</p>

<pre><code>#container {
    margin: 0 auto;
    width: 750px;
    background-color: #ffffff; }

#top-panel {
    background-color: #000000;
    text-align: left;
    width: 100%;
    height: 88px;

    background-color: #ffffff;
    float: left;
    width: 499; }

"1760419","<p>The program I am working on is having a null reference exception whenever it tries to delete the node.</p>

<p>The buggy code:</p>

                    {
                        uninstallernodename = InstalledListNodes.LocalName;

<p>The second one is where it is deleted</p>

<pre><code>XmlNode PackagesListForRemoval = InstalledList.SelectSingleNode(""/packages/installed/"" + uninstallernodename);
                        PackagesListForRemoval.ParentNode.RemoveChild(PackagesListForRemoval);
                        InstalledList.Save(""Apps.installed"");

<p>This selects all child nodes that have the title that is substituted in, regardless of type. If you follow this with a couple more simple lines of code:</p>

"1760620","<p>I use <a href=""http://www.scootersoftware.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Beyond Compare</a> (a great program), and was very impressed when it displayed a ""New Version Available"" label on its Menu Bar. I clicked on it, up popped an install new version box, it installed, the program restarted itself and there was the new version and no more label.</p>

<p>I thought that was a great feature. The label is there prominently on the menu bar where the user can't miss it. I've already got the update procedure, so all I had to do was add the label. That should be easy.</p>

<p>Here's the label where I want it:

<p>... Wrong. I couldn't figure out how to add a label there. The menu bar and the control area above it appear to be hands-off area for visual components. I couldn't place one there.</p>

<p>But I know it can be done, because Beyond Compare is a Delphi program. </p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what I have to do to put a TLabel in my Menu Bar or at least make it appear to be over the Menu Bar in the correct position?</p>

<p>For reference, I use Delphi 2009.</p>

<hr>

<p>Conclusion: Christopher seems to have correctly figured out what the Beyond Compare people did. I've decided to implement the menu item, but without the customization of his ""owner draw"" solution. So I don't get the blue bold underline hyperlink look, but I also don't lose all the automatic things (like the Vista styling) that owner draw skips.</p>

<p>To space the menu item over to the right, I've added an item after the ""Help"" that has the caption ""      "" and is disabled.</p>

<p>Thanks, Christopher. I was stuck thinking it must be a Label, but you saw around that.</p>

The squared indicator at left is ok, but so ugly, I want it round !</p>
<p>I have tried with rounded corner (cf indicators at the right of the screenshot), and I wonder if there is possibility to add a rounded mask to hide the corners (cf. css3 mask : <a href=""http://webkit.org/blog/181/css-masks/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://webkit.org/blog/181/css-masks/</a>), but it seems like it's only for img...</p>
<p>The solution can works only on webkit browsers, because it's for a mobile webapp.</p>
<p>Here is my code to create the (ugly) indicator in the image above :</p>

            &lt;div class=&quot;meter-text&quot;&gt; 70 % &lt;/div&gt;
     &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>And the css :</p>
<pre><code>.meter-wrap{
    position: relative;
}
.meter-value {
 
 background-color: #489d41;
 
}
.meter-wrap, .meter-value, .meter-text {
    width: 30px; height: 30px;
/* Attempt to round the corner : (indicators at the right of the screenshot)
-webkit-border-radius : 15px;*/
}
.meter-wrap, .meter-value {
    background: #bdbdbd top left no-repeat;
}          
.meter-text {
    position: absolute;
    top:0; left:0;
    padding-top: 2px;         
    color: #000;
    text-align: center;
    width: 100%;

<p>Since I'm working on a new project and I've transitioned to version 3.2.1 of Xcode in tandem, I'm not sure if it's my program configuration or Xcode that's causing the problem.  I have found one reference to the issue coupled with a post on the <code>dyld</code> leak that seems to be prevalent with the 3.2.1 release.</p>

<p>Since I haven't been able to find much on the problem I'm guessing it's something I've created rather than a systematic issue with Xcode.  If someone has any idea where I might have thrown a wrench in the works, I would love some pointers.  Also, if someone could just verify that the stack trace is indeed functioning properly in 3.2.1 that would be useful as well.</p>

<li>Use our  <em>background  number 1</em> on <code>.first</code> cell and align it to left, and do same on <code>.last</code> and align to right. </li>

<li>use the ImageIndex combobox in the object inspector, the list is empty (normally i'd see the available images in the combobox).</li>

<ol>
<li>paste these components into an empty form </li>
<li>add a 32x32 image to the image list</li>

<p><strong>Flash messages in Symfony projects give feedback to website users after an action is performed. They usually only show for one page load after the action is triggered.</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, when <strong>caching</strong> is turned on my messages fail to appear and only the cached version of the page is returned.</p>

<p>In one instance a version of a page with a message was cached, meaning that the message was displayed to everyone.</p>

<li>Clear selected parts of the cache whenever you set and display the flash (remember to clear it after the display of the cache, otherwise you'll bump into your problem with the flash appearing to other users again. Alternatively you can choose to programmatically disable the cache once on the page that displays the flash (see the symfony docs on '<a href=""http://www.symfony-project.org/book/1_2/12-Caching#chapter_12_sub_configuring_the_cache_dynamically"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Configuring the Cache Dynamically</a>).

"1770791","<p>Using standalone SWT Scrollbars is something of a hack (using <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1675514/swt-standalone-scrollbar-widget"">this workaround</a>), but it can be done. Here's a snippet:</p>

<pre><code>ScrolledComposite scrolledComposite = new ScrolledComposite(
                parent, SWT.V_SCROLL);
ScrollBar scrollbar = scrolledComposite.getVerticalBar();
Shell tip = new Shell(UserInterface.getShell(), SWT.ON_TOP
                | SWT.NO_FOCUS | SWT.TOOL);
// ..stylize and fill the tooltip..
</code></pre>

<p>Now what I'm trying to do is monitor when the user is interacting with the scrollbar. In particular, I want to know when the user is dragging the scrollbar&mdash;and when it has been released&mdash;in order to display an Office 2007-style tooltip revealing which page the position of the scrollbar corresponds with.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/CBfwJ.png"" alt=""Word-style scrolling tooltip""></p>

<p>Presently, I have the following code which displays the tooltip:</p>

<pre><code>scrollbar.addSelectionListener(new SelectionListener() {
    public void widgetDefaultSelected(SelectionEvent event) {}
    public void widgetSelected(SelectionEvent event) {
        tip.setVisible(true);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>It would seem logical then to have the tooltip disappear when the mouse button is released:</p>

<pre><code>scrollbar.addListener(SWT.MouseUp, new Listener() {
    public void handleEvent(Event event) {
        tip.setVisible(false);
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>However, neither <code>scrollbar</code> nor <code>scrolledComposite</code> seem to respond to the <code>SWT.MouseUp</code> event when the user interacts with the scrollbar.</p>

<p>I presently have a workaround that hides the tip after a timeout, but I'm not satisfied with this. Any insights would be most appreciated!</p>
","Mouse events on an SWT Scrollbar","<java><swt><scrollbar><mouseevent>","2009-11-20 14:30:43","4858","1800088","3","<p>Scrollbar's javadoc said this:</p>

<p>So my suggestion is get your tooltip to appear and disappear is to check for the event.detail type.</p>

<p>How can I take two 3D points and lock them to a single axis? For instance, so that both their z-axes are 0.</p>

<p><strong>What I'm trying to do:</strong></p>

<p>I have a set of 3D coordinates in a scene, representing a a box with a pyramid on it. I also have a camera, represented by another 3D coordinate. I subtract the camera coordinate from the scene coordinate and normalize it, returning a vector that points to the camera. I then do ray-plane intersection with a plane that is behind the camera point.</p>

<pre><code>O + tD
</code></pre>

<p>Where O (origin) is the camera position, D is the direction from the scene point to the camera and t is time it takes for the ray to intersect the plane from the camera point.</p>

<p>If that doesn't make sense, here's a crude drawing:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/I0Zmk.png"" alt=""Crude drawing""></p>

<p>I've searched far and wide, and as far as I can tell, this is called using a ""pinhole camera"".</p>

<p>The problem is not my camera rotation, I've eliminated that. The trouble is in translating the intersection point to barycentric (uv) coordinates. </p>

<p>The translation on the x-axis looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>uaxis.x = -a_PlaneNormal.y;
uaxis.y = a_PlaneNormal.x;
uaxis.z = a_PlaneNormal.z;

point vaxis = uaxis.CopyCrossProduct(a_PlaneNormal);

point2d.x = intersection.DotProduct(uaxis);
point2d.y = intersection.DotProduct(vaxis);

return point2d; 
</code></pre>

<p>While the translation on the z-axis looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>uaxis.x = -a_PlaneNormal.z;
uaxis.y = a_PlaneNormal.y;
uaxis.z = a_PlaneNormal.x;

point vaxis = uaxis.CopyCrossProduct(a_PlaneNormal);

point2d.x = intersection.DotProduct(uaxis);
point2d.y = intersection.DotProduct(vaxis);

return point2d; 
</code></pre>

<p>My question is: how can I turn a ray plane intersection point to barycentric coordinates on both the x and the z axis?</p>

<p>The criterion for a point (p) on a plane containing (p1) and with normal (n) is:</p>

<pre><code>(p - p1).n = 0
</code></pre>

<p>So, plug&amp;chug:</p>

<pre><code>(p0 + t*v - p1).n = (p0-p1).n + t*(v.n) = 0

                   = 0

<p>If you want to fix the Z coordinate at a particular value, you need to choose a normal along the Z axis (which will define a plane parallel to XY plane).</p>

<p>Then, you have:</p>

<pre><code>n = (0,0,1)

"1776204","<p>I'm working in C#.  I have a small VS Solution with 4 projects:  </p>

"1778122","<p>first of all, sorry for the non descriptive title, I'm just too rushed so I couldn't come up with a better one. <br />
Second: <br/> 
I have a portion of my database the looks like the following diagram: <br /> 
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/waPjv.png"" alt=""alt text"">
I have contributors on the system, each write to many sources, and a source can have many working contributors. Users can subscribe to as many contributors as they like and as many sources as they like. Now, what I want to do is simply retrieve all the articles for certain user. These articles are either coming through a contributor or a source the user subscribes to. To make it easy, when a user subscribes to a source I simply copy all the sources contributors to the users_contributors table. One tricky piece, when I retrieve the user's articles I retrieve all the articles that he his contributors write, and all the articles that were published in the sources he follows where those articles doesn't have a valid contributor on the system. (I.E contributorID is null). <br /> 
I created the following query: <br /> </p>

<pre><code> Select Articles.ArticleID, Articles.ContributorId, Contributors.Name, 
    Sources.Name, Articles.ArticleTitle
From Articles 
            Inner Join Contributors On Articles.ContributorId = Contributors.ContributorId
            Inner Join Sources On Articles.SourceId = Sources.SourceID          
Where Articles.ContributorId in (
    Select ContributorId from Users_Contributors
    Where UserID = 3
    )
    OR (

        Articles.SourceId in (
            Select SourceId from Users_Sources
            Where UserID = 3
            )

            and 
            Articles.ContributorId is null
    )
</code></pre>

<p>The problem with the above query is that, it doesn't return any article with contributorID null. I understand this is because of the join on the contributors table. What should I do in such a  case? <br /> </p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Should I consider denormalization?</strong> </li>
<li><strong>What are the prober fields to index on each table for this query
to run fast (Rowset returned are
approximately 10000)?</strong></li>
<li><p><strong>I need to support paging on this query, will ""With { }"" clause be
appropriate to me, or should I
consider another strategy?</strong></p>

<p><br /> 
Thanks in advance. <br />

<ul>
<li><strong>Text</strong> - in this case you just add link to your message like raw text. No special formating is required, but it'll depend on email client to handle the link. Most email clients will interpret string starting from <code>http://</code> as link.</li>
<li><strong>Html</strong> - in this case just add the link as usual html code <code>&lt;a href=""...""&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code>. Most email agents undestand basic html well.</li>

<p>By default <code>mail()</code> function sends email in raw text. Here is small example:</p>

    ""Hello!"",

<p>To get around this you need to subclass whatever container you want to add your styled scrollbars to and remove the child called ""whitebox"":</p>

<pre><code>var whitebox:DisplayObject = rawChildren.getChildByName('whiteBox');
if (whitebox)

"1783700","<p>I need to perform an ON DELETE CASCADE on my table named CATEGORY, which has the following columls
CAT_ID (BIGINT)
NAME (VARCHAR)
PARENT_CAT_ID (BIGINT)</p>

<p>PARENT_CAT_ID is a FK on CAT_ID. Obviously, the lovely SQL Server does not let me use ON DELETE CASCADE claiming circular or multiple paths to deletion.</p>

<p>A solution that I see often proposed is triggers. I made the following trigger:</p>

<pre><code>USE [ma]

SET NOCOUNT ON

DELETE CATEGORY FROM deleted, CATEGORY WHERE deleted.CAT_ID = CATEGORY.PARENT_CAT_ID

<p>When I manually delete a category with child categories, I get the following exception:</p>

<p>Any idea what is wrong with my trigger?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
Sorry for the edit, but I have another column CATEGORY.CAT_SCH_ID, which is a FK of another table CAT_SCH.ID. This FK has a CASCADE DELETE as well, meaning that once I delete a CAT_SCH, its CATEGORies must also be deleted. So, I get this error when I define the trigger:</p>

<p><em>Cannot create INSTEAD OF DELETE or INSTEAD OF UPDATE TRIGGER 'TRG_DEL_CATEGORY_WITH_CHILDREN' on table 'CATEGORY'. This is  because the table has a FOREIGN KEY with cascading DELETE or UPDATE.</em></p>

I usually do up my GridView starting with the overall width then calculating the width of each column and setting it declaratively in the grid markup attributes. What can throw the whole thing off is if you don't have matching widths for the headers - then it can appear that the width in the columns is not being applied. Use the RowStyle and HeaderStyle templates for this. </p>

<p>Is there some reason you are using DataGrids with 3.5? A sample of the markup might help :-)</p>

"1791068","<p>I have a doosie of a layout problem that looks like a browser bug.</p>

<p>It manifests only in FF3 (haven't tested ff2).</p>

<p>It only shows up on the first load of the page. If I resize the window it behaves properly.</p>

<p>It goes away when I put a border on the problem element, and comes back when I take the border off.</p>

<p>No other properties change.</p>

<p>Here is an image of the problem:
<img src=""https://i255.photobucket.com/albums/hh131/NashvilEric/ffMagicBorderFix.png"" alt=""footer width problem""></p>

<p>Firebug's DOM inspector thinks that the footer spans the whole width in both cases. It seems like it's only the text-align:center that's not correctly respecting the full width.
*Update: taking off text-align:center does not solve it. The text runs flush up against the left side of the screen (correct) or the purple box (incorrect).</p>

<p>The 1px purple border you can see in the screen is #centerHolder, the child of a different element and should not affect the layout of the footer, though it clearly does.
*Update: Shrinking the height of the purple box to 85%, where it couldn't possibly be in the way, doesn't change the problem at all. The text still thinks the purple box is in the way.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments and ideas.</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""container""&gt;

"1795438","<p>I have done some web based projects, but I don't think too much about the load and execution sequence of an ordinary web page. But now I need to know detail. It's hard to find answers from Google or SO, so I created this question.</p>

<p>A sample page is like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script src=""jquery.js"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src=""abc.js"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;
  &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;link rel=""stylesheets"" type=""text/css"" href=""abc.css""&gt;&lt;/link&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;h2{font-wight:bold;}&lt;/style&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
  $(document).ready(function(){
     $(""#img"").attr(""src"", ""kkk.png"");
  });
 &lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;img id=""img"" src=""abc.jpg"" style=""width:400px;height:300px;""/&gt;
    &lt;script src=""kkk.js"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So here are my questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How does this page load?</li>
<li>What is the sequence of the loading?</li>
<li>When is the JS code executed? (inline and external)</li>
<li>When is the CSS executed (applied)?</li>
<li>When does $(document).ready get executed?</li>
<li>Will abc.jpg be downloaded? Or does it just download kkk.png?</li>
</ol>

<p>I have the following understanding:</p>

<ol>
<li>The browser loads the html (DOM) at first.</li>
<li>The browser starts to load the external resources from top to bottom, line by line.</li>
<li>If a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> is met, the loading will be blocked and wait until the JS file is loaded and executed and then continue.</li>
<li>Other resources (CSS/images) are loaded in parallel and executed if needed (like CSS).</li>
</ol>

<p>Or is it like this:</p>

<p>The browser parses the html (DOM) and gets the external resources in an array or stack-like structure. After the html is loaded, the browser starts to load the external resources in the structure in parallel and execute, until all resources are loaded. Then the DOM will be changed corresponding to the user's behaviors depending on the JS.</p>

<p>Can anyone give a detailed explanation about what happens when you've got the response of a html page? Does this vary in different browsers? Any reference about this question?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I did an experiment in Firefox with Firebug. And it shows as the following image:

<p>Note that the download may be asynchronous and non-blocking due to behaviours of the browser. For example, in Firefox there is this setting which limits the number of simultaneous requests per domain.</p>
<p>Also depending on whether the component has already been cached or not, the component may not be requested again in a near-future request. If the component has been cached, the component will be loaded from the cache instead of the actual URL.</p>
<p>When the parsing is ended and document is ready and loaded, the events <code>onload</code> is fired. Thus when <code>onload</code> is fired, the <code>$(&quot;#img&quot;).attr(&quot;src&quot;,&quot;kkk.png&quot;);</code> is run. So:</p>
<ol>
<li>Document is ready, onload is fired.</li>
<li>Javascript execution hits <code>$(&quot;#img&quot;).attr(&quot;src&quot;, &quot;kkk.png&quot;);</code></li>
<li><code>kkk.png</code> is downloaded and loads into <code>#img</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>$(document).ready()</code> event is actually the event fired when all page components are loaded and ready. Read more about it: <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Introducing_$(document).ready()"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Introducing_$(document).ready()</a></p>
<h3>Edit - This portion elaborates more on the parallel or not part:</h3>
<p>By default, and from my current understanding, browser usually runs each page on 3 ways: HTML parser, Javascript/DOM, and CSS.</p>
<p>The HTML parser is responsible for parsing and interpreting the markup language and thus must be able to make calls to the other 2 components.</p>
<p>For example when the parser comes across this line:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; onclick=&quot;alert('test');return false;&quot; style=&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;a hypertext link&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The parser will make 3 calls, two to Javascript and one to CSS. Firstly, the parser will create this element and register it in the DOM namespace, together with all the attributes related to this element. Secondly, the parser will call to bind the onclick event to this particular element. Lastly, it will make another call to the CSS thread to apply the CSS style to this particular element.</p>
<p>The execution is top down and single threaded. Javascript may look multi-threaded, but the fact is that Javascript is single threaded. This is why when loading external javascript file, the parsing of the main HTML page is suspended.</p>
<p>However, the CSS files can be download simultaneously because CSS rules are always being applied - meaning to say elements are always repainted with the freshest CSS rules defined - thus making it unblocking.</p>
<p>An element will only be available in the DOM after it has been parsed. Thus when working with a specific element, the script is always placed after, or within the window onload event.</p>
<p>Script like this will cause error (on jQuery):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;/* &lt;![CDATA[ */
  alert($(&quot;#mydiv&quot;).html());
/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;mydiv&quot;&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Because when the script is parsed, <code>#mydiv</code> element is still not defined. Instead this would work:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;mydiv&quot;&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;/* &lt;![CDATA[ */
  alert($(&quot;#mydiv&quot;).html());
/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>OR</p>
<pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;/* &lt;![CDATA[ */
  $(window).ready(function(){
                    alert($(&quot;#mydiv&quot;).html());
                  });
/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;mydiv&quot;&gt;Hello World&lt;/div&gt;

 Y2 = Y1 + (int)(Math.Cos(orientation) * distance);

<p>Where orientation is a radian double value. You may want to round the result since (int) is a brutal way to convert to int.</p>

<pre><code>bool isTooClose = ( ((X - pY)*(X - pY)) + ((Y - pY)*(Y - pY)) &lt; (d*d));

The EmbeddedObjects property of a NotesDocument only includes embedded OLE objects, and not file attachments. However, the NotesRichTextItem class has an embeddedObjects property which does included file attachments. So, if you know the name of the ""field"" which will hold your file attachments - and for email using the standard template, this will be ""Body"" - you can get that field as a rich text item and then get the file attachments from there. Here is a sample:</p>

<pre><code>m_Doc = m_View.GetFirstDocument()

if (m_Doc.hasItem(""body"")) then

<p>I've got a class named EngineParameters, which holds all of those settings.</p>

<p>For the purpose of databinding, I created a <strong>bndEngineParameters</strong> class, which encapsulates all the relevant fields with getters and setters</p>

<pre><code>public class bndEngineParameters

            get { return _parameters.keyFlowAssistants; }
            set { _parameters.keyFlowAssistants = value; }
        }        
    }
</code></pre>

<p>It's not complete - there will be int values (maximum number of hours one can work etc.); I want those bool values to be bound to checkboxes on my form</p>

<p>And it's at that trivial task where I surprisingly ran into problems</p>

<p>Using ""Add New DataSource"" wizard, I created a binding source</p>

<pre><code>private System.Windows.Forms.BindingSource bndEngineParametersBindingSource;
</code></pre>

<p>I then bound the <strong>Checked</strong> property of my Checkbox to the respective property of my binding source:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/DMpW7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/DMpW7.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>I implemented a local variable <strong>boundParameters</strong> so that I get an access to the parameters set by the user</p>

<pre><code>  public partial class formGenerateRota : Form
    {

        public bndEngineParameters boundParameters;

        // (...)

        public formGenerateRota()
        {
            InitializeComponent();

        {
            boundParameters = new bndEngineParameters(new engineParameters());
            bndEngineParametersBindingSource.Add(boundParameters);            
        }

        // (...)
}
</code></pre>

<p>And what? Nothing happens. There is an bndEngineParameters object under <strong>bndEngineParametersBindingSource.Current</strong> (in run-time of course), but the <strong>avoidWeekends</strong> value never changes (when I check the checkbox on and off), and the <strong>bndEngineParametersBindingSource_CurrentItemChanged</strong> event is never fired</p>

<p>What's wrong?</p>

<hr>

<p>SORRY! it does change, but only after the checkbox loses focus (after validation).</p>

"1812311","<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am creating a Source List for my application and I want it structured in a way similar to that of iTunes, with two types of items:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Fixed"" items – these do not change and can't be moved around – at the top</li>
<li>Editable items underneath, which <em>can</em> be changed by the user – moved around, renamed etc (in the iTunes example, like Playlists and Smart Playlists)</li>
</ul>

<p>In my iTunes analogy:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/CmhD2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/CmhD2.jpg"" alt=""iTunes Source List""></a><br>
<sub>(source: <a href=""http://perspx.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/itunessourcelist.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">perspx.com</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>The way I've structured my data so far is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The items which I want to be editable are ""group"" items, in the form of <code>Group</code> Core Data entities.</li>
<li>Each item in the Source List is represented as a <code>SourceListItem</code> regular Objective-C object so that I can associate each item with a title, icon, child items etc</li>
<li>The fixed items are currently represented by <code>SourceListItem</code> instances, stored in an array in my controller object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Question</h2>

<p>I am unsure of how to amalgamate these two types of item into the Source List, so that the fixed items are at the top and always there and do not change, and the editable items are at the bottom and can be moved around and edited.</p>

<p>These are the ideas I've come up with so far:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Add the fixed items to the Core Data model.</strong> This means that I can create an entity to represent Source List items and have my fixed and editable items placed in instances of these. Then these can be bound to the Outline View table column with an Array/Tree Controller. However, this means that I'd have to create a new entity to represent the Source List items, and then sync the <code>Group</code>s with this. I'd also have to have some way of creating all the fixed items only once, and if something happened to any of the persistent store files then the fixed items would not be displayed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Merge the fixed items with the group items.</strong> Whilst both are stored in separate arrays, this could be done in the controller for my window when the Outline View requests the data (if adopting the <code>NSOutlineViewDataSource</code> protocol, not bindings). However this means that I'd have to create new <code>SourceListItem</code>s for each group in the array controller (to associate each with icons and other attributes), store these and then watch the group array controller for changes to remove, add or modify the <code>SourceListItem</code> instances when changes are made to the groups.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Does anyone have any better ideas on how I can implement this?</p>

<p>I would like my application to be compatible with OS X v10.5 so I'd prefer any solutions that <strong>didn't</strong> depend on having Snow Leopard installed.</p>

<p>I have 5 main entities in my Core Data Model:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>AbstractItem</code> - an abstract Entity that has the attributes common to all items, like <code>name</code>, <code>weight</code>, and <code>editable</code>. Also has two relationships: <code>parent</code> (to-one relationship to <code>AbstractItem</code>) and <code>children</code> (to-many relationship to <code>AbstractItem</code>, and the inverse of <code>parent</code>).</li>
<li><code>Group</code> - concrete child Entity of <code>AbstractItem</code>.</li>
<li><code>Folder</code> - concrete child Entity of <code>AbstractItem</code>. Adds a many-to-many relationship to the basic <code>Item</code> entity.</li>
<li><code>SmartFolder</code> - concrete child Entity of <code>Folder</code>. Adds a binary attribute <code>predicateData</code>. Overrides <code>Folder</code>'s ""items"" relationship accessor to return the results of executing a fetch request with the predicate defined by the <code>predicateData</code> attribute.</li>
<li><code>DefaultFolder</code> - concrete child Entity of <code>SmartFolder</code>. Adds a string attribute <code>identifier</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the ""Library"" section items, I insert <code>DefaultFolder</code> objects and give them a unique identifier so I can retrieve them easily and differentiate between them.  I also give them an <code>NSPredicate</code> that corresponds to what <code>Items</code> they're supposed to show.  For example, the ""Music"" <code>DefaultFolder</code> would have a predicate to retrieve all Music items, the ""Podcasts"" <code>DefaultFolder</code> would have a predicate to retrieve all Podcast items, etc.</p>

<p>The root-level items (""Library"", ""Shared"", ""Store"", ""Genius"", etc) are all <code>Group</code> items with a <code>nil</code> parent.  The groups and Folders that cannot be edited have their <code>editable</code> attribute set to <code>NO</code>.</p>

<p>As for actually getting this stuff in your outlineView, you'll have to implement the <code>NSOutlineViewDataSource</code> and <code>NSOutlineViewDelegate</code> protocols yourself.  There's just too much behavioral complexity here to pump it out through an <code>NSTreeController</code>.  However, in my app, I got all of the behavior in (even drag-and-drop) in under 200 lines of code (so it's not <em>that</em> bad).</p>

"1813645","<p>Folks!</p>

<p>I am trying to display ® and superscript TM symbols in my silverlight app. I want to save the text containing the symbols in a resx file.</p>

<p>Things i have tried:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Copy paste the ® symbol from any document to resx file. ® symbol gets
  displayed in the resx file. But, when
  running the silverlight app,
  xamlparseexception is thrown.</p></li>
  <li><p>Use unicode text &amp;#174 instead of ® symbol in the resx file. Same
  xamlparseexception thrown.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>My resx file encoding is utf-8.</p>

<p>Appreciate your thoughts!</p>

<p>EDITED:<br>
Incorrectly mentioned @ instead of ®.   </p>

<p>Redbox in the snapshot is how the symbol gets displayed in Silverlight. Bluebox is how it needs to be displayed.<br>
<img src=""https://i818.photobucket.com/albums/zz109/pencilslate/snapshot.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>EDIT 2 and SOLUTION:
The way the symbols are displayed are dependant on the font used. Also, displaying superscripts in Silverlight is a bit tricky. But, the simplest solution i found was to create the superscript text in Windows character map tool and copy paste it your app resource file.</p>

Some fonts draw it as a superscript others draw it as a standard character.  For example the ""Lucida Sans Unicode"" font treats it like a Superscript where as the ""Lucida Grande"" font draws it like a normal character.  Hence you need to be careful which font you use to render it.</p>

<p>I'm seeing a case in point just as I write this.  The text box where I'm writing this in SO has the ® character as a superscript whereas looking at the preview box below the character is normal size.</p>

"1814331","<p>I am creating an application with 3 different languages: english, spanish and french. I have created in-app purchases in these 3 languages and have created users on itunes sandbox for these 3 stores: France, USA and Spain.</p>

request.delegate = self;

<p>What am I missing?</p>

<p>Another point is this: if the user is not logged in on iTunes, he/she will always see the message in English and the prices in dollars. After logging in, he will see the name of the in-app object in his language and the price in his currency, but the rest of the window will be in english. See next image:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Text decorations on inline boxes are
  drawn across the entire element, going
  across any descendant elements without
  paying any attention to their
  presence. The 'text-decoration'
  property on descendant elements cannot
  have any effect on the decoration of
  the element<br>
  . . . .<br>
  Some user agents
  have implemented text-decoration by
  propagating the decoration to the
  descendant elements as opposed to
  simply drawing the decoration through
  the elements as described above. This
  was arguably allowed by the looser
  wording in CSS2.</p>

"1824606","<p>I'm making a renderer using OpenGL. I have textured models in Blender / Sketchup (I can exchange between the two easily), and I'd like to be able to export those files into my renderer. My initial idea was to simply export the raw faces and render those triangles, but I'd like to easily slice my texture files into texture coordinates as well.</p>

<p>By that, I mean that my model faces get carved into triangles. You can see in <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/g4SOJ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this image</a> (reproduced below) that my curve becomes 24 triangles. I would like to know what texture coordinates to use for each triangle.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/4TutA.png"" alt=""Polygonized curved 3D object""></p>

<p>Would a DAE file be the easiest way to do that? I've been reading the specs for the format and it looks easy enough. I think I could parse the XML and faithfully recreate the models in OpenGL. I'm wondering if there is an easier way (i.e. one that doesn't reinvent the wheel).</p>

When I perform a database search, I bind the resulting dataset to the <code>datagridview</code>.</p>

<p>I handle the <code>CellFormatting</code> event to paint rows a certain color, depending on their data.</p>

<p>My DataGridView code:</p>

<pre><code>resultsGridView.DataSource = results.DefaultViewManager.DataSet.Tables[0];
resultsGridView.AlternatingRowsDefaultCellStyle.BackColor = Color.AliceBlue;
resultsGridView.BorderStyle = BorderStyle.Fixed3D;
resultsGridView.CellFormatting += new DataGridViewCellFormattingEventHandler(resultsGridView_CellFormatting);

<pre><code>void resultsGridView_CellFormatting(object sender, DataGridViewCellFormattingEventArgs e)
{
    int rowIndex = e.RowIndex;
    DataGridViewRow therow = resultsGridView.Rows[rowIndex];
    if ((bool)therow.Cells[""Sealed""].Value == true)
    {

    {
        therow.DefaultCellStyle.BackColor = Color.LightGreen;
    }
}

<p>Everything works great except that, when I handle the CellFormatting, the whole form's Paint event seems to be turned off. The cursor stops blinking in the textbox, and the form's menustrip looks like this:</p>

<p>The top is before a search, the bottom after. The menubar won't redraw until I mouse over where the menuitems are, and then the last item to be highlighted will stay that way when I move the mouse out of the menubar. Moving the form seems to cause it to repaint, but then the problem remains.</p>

<p>Commenting out the <code>resultsGridView.CellFormatting</code> line in the datagridview code completely fixes the problem.</p>

<p>Am I painting the cells wrong, or is there something else I need to handle?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Graphical Device Interface (GDI)</strong> </p>
  
  <p>Prior to Windows Vista and Windows
  Server 2008, a window handle (HWND)
  was painted directly to the screen,
  which had certain benefits, but
  limited how Windows could display and
  manage top-level windows. In Windows
  Vista and Windows Server 2008, all
  top-level windows are rendered to an
  off-screen bitmap (similar to
  WS_EX_LAYERED), and the Desktop Window
  Manager combines the images together
  to draw the desktop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sounds like all rendering is now done to an off-screen bitmap:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>windows are rendered to an off-screen bitmap </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this correct?</p>

<p>The reason i ask is because i still see flickering during the standard paint cycle:</p>

<ul>
<li>WM_ERASEBKGND</li>
<li>WM_PAINT</li>
</ul>

<p>while desktop composition is enabled:</p>

<p>i would have assumed that between the calls to </p>

<pre><code>   BeginPaint(hWnd, paintStructure);
   ...
   EndPaint(hWnd, paintStructure);
</code></pre>

<p>that all painting would happen to a back buffer:</p>

<p>Yup (which is how the thumbnails can show you parts of the window that are currently obscured).</p>

<p>DWM's rendering of the screen is double-buffered. However, if it grabs your buffer betewen erasing and painting... it's going to show up as a visible artefact. So you still need to double buffer. The double buffering occurs on the desktop (i.e. it draws the next desktop view completely and then flips), not on the off-screen buffers that each window is drawn to.</p>

"1841515","<p>So I have a datagridview.</p>

<p>Normally I can create a bindinglist of my object and it will display all the data and colums correctly</p>

<p>E.g</p>

<pre><code>BindingList&lt;Customer&gt; CustomerList = new BindingList&lt;Customer&gt;();
myDataGridView.DataSource = CustomerList;
</code></pre>

<p>And it will display a column for each property in Customer which has a getter.
It will also display a row for each object.</p>

<p>Perfect result.</p>

<p>Now in my current scenario, I have these objects:</p>

<pre><code>public class Reservedele
{
    public int Rnr { get; private set;}
    public string Navn { get; private set;}
    public double Pris { get; private set;}
    public string Type { get; private set;}

    public Reservedele(int rnr, string navn, double pris, string type)
    {
        Rnr = rnr;
        Navn = navn;
        Pris = pris;
        Type = type;
    }
}
public class IndkøbsKurvReservedele
{
    public Reservedele Reservedel  { get; private set;}
    public int Antal { get; private set; }
    public double Pris { get; private set; }

    public IndkøbsKurvReservedele(Reservedele reservedel, int antal, double pris)
    {
        Reservedel = reservedel;
        Antal = antal;
        Pris = pris;
    }
}

<pre><code>BindingList&lt;IndkøbsKurvReservedele&gt; ReserveDeleListeIndKøbsKurv = new BindingList&lt;IndkøbsKurvReservedele&gt;();
myDataGridView.DataSource = ReserveDeleListeIndKøbsKurv;

<p>It won't work :(
The error is that the datagridview shows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The object itself</li>
<li>Antal</li>
<li>Pris</li>

</p>

<p>How can I instruct the datagridview that I want it to have the properties from <code>Reservedel</code> followed by the properties in <code>IndkøbsKurvReservedele</code> as headers??</p>

<p>For reference, Reservedel means ""spare parts"" and IndkøbsKurvReservedel means something like ""ShoppingBasketOfSpareParts"".
Antal means ""amount"" as in how many there is.
Sorry for the foreign variable naming.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I have another question: How can I make the <code>Rnr</code> property not to show up as a column?</p>

A rectangle works as a container for data regions. If I place the table into a rectangle, it will only grow within the boundaries of the rectangle, without pushing other report items around.
In order for this to work, though, the table must be a child control of the rectangle.  This is achieved by dropping a new table into an existing text box, or by dropping an existing table some place outside of the rectangle, then moving it back inside. If you just draw a rectangle around the table, it will not become a child. This can be verified by right-clicking on the table. If it only says ""select body"" and not ""select rectanglexx"" as well, it is not a child of the rectangle.
Alternatively, it is possible to place other items (text boxes, etc into a rectangle that is on one side of a table. The top edge of the rectangle must be above the bottom edge of the table. Then any controls in the rectangle will be unaffected by the growth of the table, but other items below the table will. </p>

"1849182","<p>Ok so I'm trying to use Apache Commons Math library to compute a double integral, but they are both from negative infinity (to around 1) and it's taking ages to compute. Are there any other ways of doing such operations in java? Or should it run ""faster"" (I mean I could actually see the result some day before I die) and I'm doing something wrong?</p>

<p>EDIT: Ok, thanks for the answers. As for what I've been trying to compute it's the Gaussian Copula:
<img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/a/c/8/ac8e3a7b79c030c2bf8ff053b80823c3.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>So we have a standard bivariate normal cumulative distribution function which takes as arguments two inverse standard normal cumulative distribution functions and I need integers to compute that (I know there's a Apache Commons Math function for standard normal cumulative distribution but I failed to find the inverse and bivariate versions).</p>

<p>EDIT2: as my friend once said ""ahhh yes the beauty of Java, no matter what you want to do, someone has already done it"" I found everything I needed here <a href=""http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~simardr/ssj/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~simardr/ssj/</a> very nice library for probability etc.</p>
","Numerical computation in Java","<java>","2009-12-04 19:37:51","2096","1850129","4","<p>There are two problems with infinite integrals: convergence and value-of-convergence. That is, does the integral even converge? If so, to what value does it converge? There are integrals which are guaranteed to converge, but whose value it is not possible to determine exactly (try the integral from 1 to infinity of e^(-x^2)). If it can't be exactly returned, then an exact answer is not possible mathematically, which leaves only approximation. Apache Commons uses several different approximation schemes, but all require the use of finite bounds for correctness. </p>

<p>The best way to get an appropriate answer is to repeatedly evaluate finite integrals, with ever increasing bounds, and compare the results. In pseudo-code, it would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>double DELTA = 10^-6//your error threshold here
double STEP_SIZE = 10.0;
double oldValue=Double.MAX_VALUE;
double newValue=oldValue;
double lowerBound=-10; //or whatever you want to start with--for (-infinity,1), I'd
                       //start with something like -10
double upperBound=1;

do{
     oldValue = newValue;

     lowerBound-= STEP_SIZE;
     newValue = integrate(lowerBound,upperBound); //perform your integration methods here
}while(Math.abs(newValue-oldValue)&gt;DELTA);
</code></pre>

<p>Eventually, if the integral converges, then you will get enough of the important stuff in that widening the bounds further will not produce meaningful information.</p>

<p>A word to the wise though: this kind of thing can be explosively bad if the integral doesn't converge.  In that case, one of two situations can occur: Either your termination condition is never satisfied and you fall into an infinite loop, or the value of the integral oscillates indefinitely around a value, which may cause your termination condition to be incorrectly satisfied (giving incorrect results). </p>

<p>To avoid the first, the best way is to put in some maximum number of steps to take before returning--doing this should stop the potentially infinite loop that can result.</p>

<p>To avoid the second, hope it doesn't happen or prove that the integral must converge (three cheers for Calculus 2, anyone? ;-)).</p>

<p>To answer your question formally, no, there are no other such ways to perform your computation in java. In fact, there are no guaranteed ways of doing it in <em>any</em> language, with <em>any</em> algorithm--the mathematics just don't work out the way we want them to. However, in practice, a lot (though by no means all!) of the practical integrals do converge; its been my experience that only about ~20 iterations will give you an approximation of reasonable accuracy, and Apache should be fast enough to handle that without taking absurdly long.</p>

"1849906","<p>I have what I thought was a pretty simple need but I'm not sure how to go about implementing it.</p>

<p>At various points in my interface, the user is asked to make a selection of something rather visual (like choosing a layout for a page or a color option.) These selections are made from a pre-defined set of options. Normally you'd use an NSPopUpButton, or maybe an NSTableView, but I would like the user to see thumbnails of each selection option. These thumbnails ought to be a decent size, too--at least 100x100 pixels. Each thumbnail should also be accompanied by a text label. Only one selection is allowed at once.</p>

<p>Apple implements something rather like this in iWeb:</p>

<p>I'm thinking that an NSCollectionView is the place to start, but I've only ever seen this used in much more complicated scenarios (eg: displaying the contents of a directory, supporting drag and drop, etc.) Therefore, most of the code I've found is rather complicated.</p>

<p>Is there a simpler solution to populate this view with static, pre-defined data and just allow for a simple selection? In other words, I'm looking for the functionality of a pop-up button but a different user interface.</p>

<p><strong>Update: solution</strong></p>

<p>I used IKImageBrowser, as suggested. <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/DOCUMENTATION/GraphicsImaging/Conceptual/ImageKitProgrammingGuide/ImageBrowser/ImageBrowser.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40004907-CH5-SW1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This tutorial</a> was very helpful. In IB: I just made an IKImageBrowser in my interface, wrapped it in a scroll view, and made it the data source of the browser object. In code: implemented the data source protocol in my controller like the tutorial explains, set allowsMultipleSelection and allowsEmptySelection to NO, created a custom image object using the URL image representation exactly as explained in the tutorial.</p>

<p>Then, to get the selection, I wrote the following method to be triggered when the user clicks the ""OK"" button:</p>

<pre><code>NSIndexSet *retval = [imageBrowser selectionIndexes];
NSInteger i = [retval firstIndex];  //the index of the selection. Corresponds to index in my array data source
NSString* path = [[styleViewData objectAtIndex:i] imageRepresentation]; //path to selected image, if you need it

<p>The Items property is a collection of System.Object.  That allows a combo box to store and display any kind of class object.  But you'll have to cast it from object to your class type to use the selected object in your code.  That can't work in your case, you added an object of an anonymous type.  You'll need to declare a small helper class to store the Value and Text properties.  Some sample code:</p>

"1855800","<p>Instead of rating items with grades from 1 to 10, I would like to have 1 vs 1 ""fights"". Two items are displayed beside each other and you pick the one which you like more. Based on these ""fight"" results, an algorithm should calculate ratings for each item.</p>

<p>You can see this approach on <a href=""http://www.flickchart.com/faq"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flickchart.com</a> where movies are rated using this approach.</p>

<p>It looks like this:</p>

<p>As you can see, items are pushed upwards if they win a ""fight"". The ranking is always changing based on the ""fight"" results. But this can't be only based on the win quote (here 54%) since it's harder to win against ""Titanic"" than against ""25th Hour"" or so.</p>

<p>There are a few things which are quite unclear for me:
- How are the ratings calculated? How do you decide which film is on the first place in the ranking? You have to consider how often an items wins and how good are the beaten items.
- How to choose which items have a ""fight""?</p>

<p>Basically, all movies start off with 0 wins/losses and every time they get a win they get a certain amount of points. You usually have an average around 20 (but any number will do) and winning against a movie with the same rating as yourself will give exactly that 20. Winning against a bad movie will maybe give around 10 points, while winning against a better movie might give you 30 points. The other way around, losing to a good movie you only lose 10 points, but if you lose to a bad movie, you lose 30 points.</p>

<p>FWIW, we never ended up implementing this in our code. The two features that required internet access (entering the sweepstakes, and buying the dvd), were not main features. Nothing else required internet access. </p>

<p>Instead of adding more code, we just set the background of both internet views to a notice telling the users they must be connected to the internet to use this feature. It was in theme with the rest of the application's interface, and was done well/tastefully. They said nothing about it during the approval process, however we did get a personal phone call to verify that we were giving away items that actually pertained to the movie. According to their usually vague agreement, you aren't allowed to have sweepstakes otherwise. </p>

<p>I would also think this adheres more strictly to their ""only use things if you absolutely need them"" ideaology as well.  </p>

"1863309","<p>my question today deals with Flash AS3 video buffering. (Streaming or Progressive) I want to be able to detect when the video is being buffered, so I can display some sort of animation letting the user know to wait just a little longer.</p>

It seems to me that the key status to be working in is <code>""NetStream.Buffer.Empty""</code> so I added some code in there to see if this would trigger my animation or a trace statement. No luck yet, however when the Buffer is full it will trigger my code :/ Maybe my video is always somewhere between <code>Buffer.Empty</code> and <code>Buffer.Full</code> that's why it won't trigger any code when I test case for <code>Buffer.Empty</code>?</p>

<p>My goal is to set up a connection to a MySQL database using Entity Framework (an ADO.NET Entity Data Model). I'm getting frustrated by all the wizards and dialog boxes and I still can't find what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>Here's what I've done so far: I just installed the MySQL .NET Connector v6.1.3 on my machine (to my knowledge, it is correctly installed.  It shows up in Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel).  In Visual Studio (Visual C# 2008 Express Edition SP1 with Entity Framework Version that ships with SP1), I click to add a reference to a project, click on ""ADO.NET Entity Data Model"" and that brings me to a screen that asks ""What should the model contain?""  I select ""Generate from database"" and then click Next.</p>

<p>This screen asks me which data connection I should use.  I click ""New Connection"" and get a screen that looks like this:</p>

"1865294","<p>I'm trying to display the MS Word ""Print Setup"" dialog in a VSTO AddIn for Microsoft Word 2003. I can display the dialog box, but the options button at the bottom left corner of the dialog is always disabled as per the following screen capture.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/xOkgh.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/xOkgh.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>

Ben</p>
","How to programmatically enable the ""Options..."" button in the MS Word Print Setup dialog","<c#><ms-word><ms-office><vsto>","2009-12-08 07:38:52","2100","1911888","2","<p>I now have a solution that works that I got from a colleague. </p>

<p>While it doesn't solve the more general case of launching this dialog from any VSTO C# code, it does work for launching this dialog correctly as a result of clicking a toolbar button (which is what we are trying to do). So this fixes the problem for us.</p>

<p>I'm actually of the opinion now that this is a bug (feature?) of MS Word and that there isn't any general way of displaying this dialog from code and having the ""Options..."" button enabled. I think it can only work if the dialog is invoked automatically by MS Word due to it being hooked up to the CommandBar as a built-in control. I've seen the same behaviour in VBA as well as through VSTO which tends to support the theory that it's a Word limitation/bug.</p>

<p>So we previously had code like this:</p>

<pre><code>public MyCommandBar()
{
  _myBar = App.CommandBars.Add(""My Toolbar"", 1, Type.Missing, true);

  // Add a button to call our custom event handler
  _printSetup = (CommandBarButton)
          _myBar.Controls.Add(MsoControlType.msoControlButton, 
          Type.Missing, Type.Missing, 1, true); 
  _printSetup.Click += printSetup_Click(); // Call the handler shown in my original question
  // More stuff...
}
</code></pre>

<p>And when modified to call the built-in control by changing the second argument (Id) to Controls.Add() from Type.Missing to 511 (the ID for the File Print Setup dialog) like this the ""Options..."" button is enabled like one would expect:</p>

<pre><code>public MyCommandBar()
{
  _myBar = App.CommandBars.Add(""My Toolbar"", 1, Type.Missing, true);

  // Call the built-in File Print Setup dialog automagically
  _printSetup = (CommandBarButton)
          _myBar.Controls.Add(MsoControlType.msoControlButton, 
          511, Type.Missing, 1, true); 
  // More stuff...
}

<p>Hopefully this helps others who run into this problem.</p>

"1866903","<p>I'm drawing a custom diagram of business objects using .NET GDI+. Among other things, the diagram consists of several lines that are connecting the objects.</p>

    return; // not a line

  double dx = endPoint.X - startPoint.X;
  double dy = endPoint.Y - startPoint.Y;
  if (dx == 0)
  {
    // vertical line:
    if (endPoint.Y &lt; startPoint.Y)
      endPoint.Y -= pixelCount;
    else
      endPoint.Y += pixelCount;
  }
  else if (dy == 0)
  {
    // horizontal line:
    if (endPoint.X &lt; startPoint.X)
      endPoint.X -= pixelCount;
    else
      endPoint.X += pixelCount;
  }
  else
  {
    // non-horizontal, non-vertical line:
    double length = Math.Sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
    double scale = (length + pixelCount) / length;
    dx *= scale;
    dy *= scale;
    endPoint.X = startPoint.X + Convert.ToSingle(dx);
    endPoint.Y = startPoint.Y + Convert.ToSingle(dy);
  }

"1872251","<p>tl;dr; Even without my explanation one can look at the code below and the output and see something is fishy.  Splice returns the index it spliced but the data remains in the array.</p>

<p>So I have an object that's keyed almost like an array (0,1,2,3...etc).  Each object key has an array value.  The array is an array of objects.  Here's a simplified object that shows the basic structure I'm working with:</p>

<pre><code>obj = {
    '1': [{},{},{},{}],
    '2': [{},{},{},{}],
    '3': [{},{},{},{}]
};
</code></pre>

<p>I have some code that needs to splice out one of the array indices (objects) from one of those arrays.  This is the code, with console logging around everything (which I will show the output of below).</p>

<pre><code>console.log(indices_to_remove);
for(j = 0; j &lt; indices_to_remove.length; j++) {
    console.log(""i: "" + i)
    console.log('j: ' + j)
    console.log(this._index);
    console.log(this._index[i].splice(indices_to_remove[j], 1));
    console.log(this._index);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice on the second ""console.log(this._index);"" the spliced object is still part of the original array.  I would assume that this._index[2] would now have one less item.  Also, I should be splicing out index 0, yet it returns index 1.  </p>

<p>Here's the output:

<p>So if anyone has any insight into what I might be doing wrong please speak up!</p>

<pre><code>2*i3 + i2 - i1 - 1.5 &gt;= 0
</code></pre>

<p>First, let's look at the highest positively-weighted value. If <code>i3</code> is 0, the most you can get for the left side is -0.5, so <code>i3</code> has to be 1 to get a non-zero output. The equation then becomes:</p>

<pre><code>i2 - i1 + 0.5 &gt;= 0
</code></pre>

<p>Now look at the negatively-weighted value. If <code>i1</code> is 0, the output will always be greater than zero no matter what <code>i2</code> is. If <code>i1</code> is 1, <code>i2</code> has to be 1 as well for there to be a non-zero output.</p>

<p>You therefore have these combinations which create a non-zero output:</p>

"1884150","<p>I've been toying with the idea of building a web-based Roguelike game using Silverlight (or maybe just a desktop game using WPF).</p>

<p>If you don't know what a Roguelike is, it's a type of graphical RPG where the graphics are rendered using text. Because the graphics engine is relatively simple, you get to spend your time building features into the game and it's possible for one person to quickly build something fun.</p>

<p>For instance, a typical screen might look something like this (the @ is the player, # is a wall, the other characters are things like monsters, stairs, and items):</p>

<p>I'm an experienced ASP.Net dev and I'm just getting started with Silverlight. Is there a particular approach I should take for this? </p>

<p>To provide some background, in Winforms, most standard approaches are too slow  -- the text ends up updating with a visible, ugly blink. I'm thinking something to do with the Canvas might be appropriate, but even better would be to somehow draw a screen into a buffer and then instantly flip that onto the screen so that it becomes visible instantly. </p>

<p>But I don't really want to mess around with DirectX right now - I'm hoping WPF can get me to where I need to be without a big learning curve.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> So this turned out to be pretty challenging. I tried a lot of different approaches and I was finally able to get it to actually render fast enough, but I think that to make it blazing hot fast you should probably build a sprite map of the font you want to use and work from that instead of trying to use any of the built in font rendering stuff. I didn't do that.</p>

<p>When I got the core rendering engine done, I ended up with some annoying artifacts related to quirks of font rendering (even fixed width fonts are sometimes a liiitle bit wide...), and when I finally worked that out I discovered <a href=""http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/features/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libtcod</a>, which is a very impressive roguelike engine that has a C# wrapper. That's all console based. I played with it a little and I was blown away. </p>

<p>As of 1.5.1, everything I've touched in libtcod works great except for the mouse input stuff and one of the keyboard input modes (which I think they recently ditched), but everything you need to make a roguelike is in there, and that includes several line-of-sight, pathfinding, and even dungeon generation algorithms. It's pretty advanced visually. Have you ever seen an RL like this?</p>

<p>In a nutshell, it's possible to build a roguelike with silverlight, but I wouldn't go in expecting it to be easy unless you've already got a strong silverlight or game dev background. You're going to be re-inventing some serious wheels, and even with a powerful toolkit that allows to focus on gameplay, there's no shortage of things to do.</p>

<p>Silverlight would probably work, but it doesn't have the same hardware acceleration that WPF provides, so the performance will be lower.</p>

<p>There are lots of options for actual implementation.  You could use a canvas and render yourself.  Alternatively, if you're getting update issues, a grid of canvases (only updating the ones as needed) might help the retained mode rendering system perform a bit better, but I doubt, with standard screen resolutions, you'd have any issues with this amount of text in WPF.</p>

<p>I'm displaying preview images to users in my UI within a ListBox.  When a user hovers over the image, I'd like to expand it so the user can see more detail.</p>

<p>I've gotten to the point where I can ""pop up"" the image, but of course it is still within its normal position in the layout, meaning that rather than the image being displayed on top of the other controls near it, it only appears on top of the controls rendered before it and underneath those rendered after it.  It is also being cropped by the bounds of the ListBox.</p>

<p>Is there a simple (i.e., no custom control development) way to, temporarily, remove that image from the visual layout and put it above all other elements?</p>

<p>Here's a crappy demo app that shows what I'm talking about:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/nfOaI.png"" alt=""Description of the issue""></p>

<p>Notice the zoomed image is clipped by the bounds of the ListBox (outside of the list box is red).  Also, notice that UI elements rendered after the zoomed image overlay it still--both icons that come later and item names (""Item 5"" and others seen in the lower left hand corner).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>In this snippet, the popup is not open until <code>IsMouseOver</code> is true for its Image (named ""icon"").  When the mouse enters the image, two things happen.  The Popup opens (at 640x640) and an image is shown (48px by 48px).  This image has a scale transform on it.  The ""icon"" Image also has a storyboard for MouseEnter and MouseLeave.  This storyboard uses a double animation, targeted at the popup image's ScaleTransform.  This storyboard enlarges the image when the mouse enters and shrinks it when it leaves with a nice easing function.</p>

<p>The use case would be:  ""User is presented a listbox with small images for each item in the list.  When the user hovers over the small image (icon), it springs forward and enlarges, giving the user a better view of the image.  When the mouse leaves the image, it shrinks back to its original size.""</p>

You can achieve this by setting each cone's aperture to create a circumscribed circle around each cubemap face. In this case you don't have to worry about overlapping, since the <em>would be overlapping</em> parts are out of the faces' area.</p>

<p>In other terms: adjust the lights' projection matrix' FOV, so it won't the view frustum that includes the light cone, but the cone will include the view frustum.</p>

","BlackBerry - Creating custom Date Field","<user-interface><datetime><blackberry><custom-controls><datetimepicker>","2009-12-11 21:53:14","5394","1892794","3","<p>It could be simple Label or Bitmap Field extention, with navigation event handling.  </p>

<p>You will need to hold String array with values which will be changed in circle on horizontal navigation.<br>
If such custom Field is focused, draw Up and Down arrays.  </p>

<p>So, there will be one such Field for DayOfWeek, one for Month, one for DayOfMonth, one for Year.</p>

<p>Place them all in HorizontalFieldManager, which will be placed in PopupScreen, on popup close geather all values and compose Date value (may be passed over FieldChangeListener)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<h2>Storm support</h2>

<p>On devices with wheel its easy to implement save-and-close functionality on navigation click, but in Storm that would be a problem (dialog will be closed on each field focus action). To solve this, OK and Cancel buttons added.</p>

<p>Also, touchEvent added to handle proper value change using touch click.</p>

<p>You may keep different implementations for RIM OS &lt;= 4.6 and RIM OS >= 4.7, and replace them on build task.</p>

To enable scrolling in any direction, you can set the <code>allowsUserInteraction</code> property of the plot space to YES.</p>

<p>We currently have no means of locking that movement to one direction.  The scrolling action takes place in the <code>-pointingDeviceDraggedAtPoint:</code> method on CPXYPlotSpace, so you could subclass CPXYPlotSpace, copy over its implementation of that method, and alter it to only allow movement in the X direction.  Even better, we'd appreciate any contributions to extend the functionality of the CPXYPlotSpace to add support for unidirectional movement.</p>

<p>Here is a copy of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2305097/installation-of-eclipse-closed"">a more general answer (since then deleted)</a> on Eclipse installation:</p>

<p>Having a simple JRE is enough for eclipse to run.<br>
Eclipse will try to launch with the default ""java.exe"" (the first one referenced by your PATH)</p>

<p>Three things to remember:</p>

<ul>
<li>""installing"" a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1906445/whats-the-work-of-jdk-and-jre"">JRE or a JDK</a> can be as simple as unzipping or copying it from another computer: there is no special installation steps, and you can have as many different JVM versions (1.4, 5.0, 6.0...) as you want, ""installed"" (copied) almost anywhere on your disk.</li>
<li>the JVM you will reference <em>within</em> your Eclipse session is <em>not</em> always the one used for launching Eclipse because:

<ul>
<li>you only need a JRE to launch Eclipse, but once Eclipse launched, you should register  a JDK for your projects  (especially for Java sources and debugging purposes, also in theory for compilation but Eclipse has its own Java compiler)<br>
Note: You could register just a JRE within Eclipse because it is enough to <em>run</em> your program, but again a JVM will allow for more operations.</li>
<li>Even though the default registered Java in Eclipse is the one used to launch the session, you can want to register an older SDK (including a non-Sun one) in order to run/debug your programs with a JRE similar to the one which will actually be used in production. </li>
</ul></li>
<li>I would recommend to always run Eclipse with the <strong>lastest JRE</strong> possible (to benefit from the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/198577/real-differences-between-java-server-and-java-client"">latest hotspot</a> evolutions). You can reference that in your <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/142357/what-are-the-best-jvm-settings-for-eclipse/1409590#1409590"">eclipse.ini</a>.</li>

        &lt;/HierarchicalDataTemplate&gt; 
    &lt;/TreeView.ItemTemplate&gt; 
&lt;/TreeView&gt;  
</code></pre>

<p>And the tree structure:</p>

<pre><code>
public class Node : IEnumerable { 
    private string text; 
    private ObservableCollection&lt;Node&gt; children; 
    public string Text { get { return text; } } 
    public ObservableCollection&lt;Node&gt; Children { get { return children; } } 
    public Node(string text, params string[] items){ 
        this.text = text; 
        children = new ObservableCollection&lt;Node&gt;(); 
        foreach (string item in items) 
            children.Add(new Node(item)); 
    } 
    public IEnumerator GetEnumerator() { 
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; children.Count; i++) 
            yield return children[i]; 
    } 
} </code></pre>

<p>I set the ItemsSource of this tree to be the root of my tree structure, and the children of that become root-level items in the tree (just as I want):</p>

<pre><code>
private Node root; 

root = new Node(""Animals""); 
for(int i=0;i&lt;3;i++) 
    root.Children.Add(new Node(""Mammals"", ""Dogs"", ""Bears"")); 
tree.ItemsSource = root; 
</code></pre>

<p>I can add new children to the various non-root nodes of my tree structure, and they appear in the TreeView right where they should.</p>

<pre><code>root.Children[0].Children.Add(new Node(""Cats"", ""Lions"", ""Tigers""));  </code></pre>

<p>But, if I add a child to the root node:</p>

<pre><code>root.Children.Add(new Node(""Lizards"", ""Skinks"", ""Geckos"")); </code></pre>

"1900614","<p>I'm working on a UI which needs to work in different aspect ratios, 16:9, 16:10, 4:3</p>

<p>The idea is conceptually simple: Everything is centered to the screen in a rough 4:3 area and anything outside this portion of screen has basic artwork, so something like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/kO9f1.png"" alt=""alt text"">
(not drawn to scale)</p>

<p>Where the pink area represents whre all the UI objects are positioned and the blue area is just background and effects.</p>

<p>The trick is in usability, if I pass in coordinates (0,0) in a 4:3 aspect ratio environment (0,0) would be the top left of the screen. However if I'm in a 16:9 environment (0,0) needs to get renormalized based on the new aspect ratio for it to be in the appropriate place. So my question is: How can I achieve this?</p>

<p>edit: for clarification this is basically for a UI system and while I listed the ratios above as 4:3, 16:9, 16:10 it should be able to dynamically adjust values for whatever aspect ratio it is set to.</p>

<p>edit 2: Just to add more details to the situation: When the positions fo rsetting are passed in they are passed in as a % of the screens current widht height, so basically setting position x would be: [pos x as portion of screen]*SCREEN_WIDTH where screen width is the width of the current screen itself.</p>

Since 4x3 is 16x9, it appears you want a 16x9 screen to have 2x9 bands to the left and the right. Hence, the X offset should be (2/16) * width.</p>

<p>For 16x10 screens, the factor is slightly more complicated: 4x3 is 13.33x10, so you have edges of width 1.67, and the X offset should be (1.67/16) * width = (5/48)* width.</p>

","Creating the Phone App's in-call view in iPhone","<iphone><objective-c><user-interface><uikit>","2009-12-14 15:58:28","866","1902089","1","<p>They all look suitably different to be custom views to me. If you just want a control like this for a single view (i.e. not a more flexible configurable container type control) it should be relatively quick &amp; easy to knock it up in xcode &amp; IB. I've done similar things in my apps. Steps I would take are as follows:</p>

<p>1) create an empty NIB file and design your control there by using UIView, UIImageView, UIButton controls etc.</p>

<p>2) Create a new ObjC class derived from UIView</p>

<p>3) Ensure the 'root' UIView object in the NIB has class type matching your ObjC UIView derived class</p>

<p>4) Attach IBOutlets &amp; IBAction event handlers to your class and wire up all the button events ('Touch up inside') to your class event handler methods in IB.</p>

<p>5) Add a static factory function to your class to create itself from the NIB. e.g. </p>

<pre><code>// Factory method - loads a NavBarView from NavBarView.xib
+ (MyCustomView*) myViewFromNib;
{
    MyCustomView* myView = nil;
    NSArray* nib = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@""MyCustomViewNib"" owner:nil options:nil];
    // The behavior here changed between SDK 2.0 and 2.1. In 2.1+, loadNibNamed:owner:options: does not
    // include an entry in the array for File's Owner. In 2.0, it does. This means that if you're on
    // 2.2 or 2.1, you have to grab the object at index 0, but if you're running against SDK 2.0, you
    // have to grab the object at index:1.
#ifdef __IPHONE_2_1
    myView = (MyCustomView *)[nib objectAtIndex:0];
#else
    myView = (MyCustomView *)[nib objectAtIndex:1];
#endif
    return myView;
}
</code></pre>

<p>6) Create and place onto your parent view as normal:</p>

<pre><code>    MyCustomView* myView = [MyCustomView myViewFromNib]; 
    [parentView addSubview:myView];
    myView.center = parentView.center;
</code></pre>

<p>With regard to the event handling, I tend to create just one button event handler, and use the passed id param to determine which button is pressed by comparing against IBOutlet members or UIView tags. I also often create a delegate protocol for my custom view class and call back through that delegate from the button's event handler. 
e.g. </p>

<p>MyCustomViewDelegate.h:</p>

<pre><code>@protocol MyCustomViewDelegate
- (void) doStuffForButton1;
// etc
@end
</code></pre>

<p>ParentView.m:</p>

<pre><code>myView.delegate = self;

- (void) doStuffForButton1
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>MyCustomView.m:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction) onButtonPressed:(id)button
{
    if (button == self.button1 &amp;&amp; delegate)
    {
        [delegate doStuffForButton1];
    }
    // or
    UIView* view = (UIView*)button;
    if (view.tag == 1 &amp;&amp; delegate)
    {
        [delegate doStuffForButton1];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem seems to be with page height.  On the other browsers if the page is not very tall, this Premium Services section still retains a height that fits everything, but in Webkit if the page is short, this section shortens itself and puts the first item next to the Premium Services header image rather than on the line below it.  If the page is long enough, then this issue doesn't occur.</p>

<p>You can see in the code below I am naively looping through ALL cells at every index to determine if there is a cell at the requested index. This works great when I have a few (hundred) cells, but breaks down quickly when I have thousands of cells.</p>

<p>In this particular case the highlighted group is mobile, and can only move to the index before or after the previous/next occupied cell. So groupMinX/maxX is the minimum and maximum x value it can move based on the position of other cells in the row.</p>

<p>From your image I think you can make a small image of dimension 5*5 or something and make it repeat vertically and horizontally. For that you don't have to set the background position, because <code>repeat</code> is the initail value for <strong><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms530721%28VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">background-position</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I now have my data moved from a single 400 column table to a much more managable database structure with many thanks to Damir Sudarevic.</p>

<p>My database looks like this:</p>

<pre><code> CREATE TABLE JobFiles (

<p>However, for a particular function of my application I need to list every JobParamType.Name row as columns containing a JobMeasurement.Value or JobTrait.Value as its data for each JobFiles.Name.</p>

<p>JobParamType.IsTrait is used to determine if a value is a Measurement or Trait.</p>

<p>i.e. </p>

<pre><code>JobName  |  ParamName1      |  ParamName2      |  ParamName3       ... | ParamName400
""MyJob""     MesurementValue    TraitValue         MesurementValue  ...   TraitValue  
""TestJob""   MesurementValue    TraitValue         MesurementValue  ...   TraitValue  
""Job2""      MesurementValue    TraitValue         MesurementValue  ...   TraitValue  

etc
</code></pre>

<p>I have been playing with pivoting tables and have managed to get the columns from the JobParamType table by looking at examples and following them but it is now getting quite complicated because my data is split between several tables and it is starting to make my head hurt!!!</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @cols NVARCHAR(MAX)
SELECT  @cols = STUFF(( SELECT DISTINCT TOP 10 PERCENT

                        ORDER BY '],[' + tParams.Name
                        FOR XML PATH('')
                      ), 1, 2, '') + ']'
print @cols

<p>I hope this makes sense and I look forward to your help and discussions.</p>

","SQL Syntax to Pivot multiple tables","<sql><sql-server><t-sql><pivot>","2009-12-16 12:14:12","5720","1915438","1","<p>I will post a few examples from <strong><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1762305/sql-server-one-table-with-400-columns-or-40-tables-with-10-columns/1771094#1771094"">this model</a></strong> -- because I already have them. Both models are very similar, so you should not have too much trouble adopting this technique.</p>

<p>When it comes to headache, I find that the simplest way is to go step by step, and optimize later.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>.<br>
Create a view to flatten the model; (<strong><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1762305/sql-server-one-table-with-400-columns-or-40-tables-with-10-columns/1771094#1771094"">see the model</a></strong>)</p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW dbo.vProperties AS 
SELECT  m.MachineID AS [Machine ID]
,s.SetupID AS [Setup ID]
,p.PropertyID AS [Property ID]
,t.PropertyTypeID AS [Property Type ID]
,m.Name AS [Machine Name]
,s.Name AS [Setup Name]
,t.Name AS [Property Type Name]
,t.IsTrait AS [Is Trait]
,x.Value AS [Measurement Value]
,x.Unit AS [Unit]
,y.Value AS [Trait]
FROM dbo.Machine AS m
JOIN dbo.Setup AS s ON s.MachineID = m.MachineID
JOIN dbo.Property AS p ON p.SetupID = s.SetupID
JOIN dbo.PropertyType AS t ON t.PropertyTypeID = p.PropertyTypeID
LEFT JOIN dbo.Measurement AS x ON x.PropertyID = p.PropertyID
LEFT JOIN dbo.Trait AS y ON y.PropertyID = p.PropertyID
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>.</p>

<p>Create a view to generate only <code>[Setup Name], [Property Type Name], [Value]</code>; note that in this one the measurement value and trait end up in the same column. You would probably use <code>JobName, ParameterTypeName, Value</code></p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW dbo.vSetupValues AS 
SELECT  [Setup Name]
       ,[Property Type Name]
       ,COALESCE(cast([Measurement Value] AS varchar(50)), [Trait]) AS [Val]
FROM dbo.vProperties
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>.</p>

<p>Create list of properties (Parameters) with a column to order by</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @Props TABLE (
id int IDENTITY (1,1)
,PropName varchar(50)
);

INSERT INTO @Props  (PropName)
SELECT DISTINCT [Name]
FROM dbo.PropertyType
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong>.</p>

<p>Now I will dynamically create the query text</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @qw TABLE(
id int IDENTITY (1,1)
, txt nchar(500)
)

INSERT  INTO @qw (txt)
  SELECT  'SELECT' UNION
  SELECT  '[Setup Name]' ;

INSERT  INTO @qw (txt)   
  SELECT  ',MAX(CASE [Property Type Name] WHEN ''' + PropName
  + ''' THEN Val ELSE NULL END) AS [' + PropName + ']'
  FROM  @Props
  ORDER BY id;

INSERT  INTO @qw (txt)
 SELECT  'FROM dbo.vSetupValues' UNION
 SELECT  'GROUP BY [Setup Name]' UNION
 SELECT  'ORDER BY [Setup Name]';
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong>.</p>

<p>And here is the text of the query, form this point I can package this into a stored procedure, another view, or into a variable to use as dynamic sql.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT txt FROM @qw

"1914947","<p>What is the best approach to implement tabs that look like web applications on the iPhone, like the screenshot below (notice the ""Checkin-Info-Friends"" tabs)? These are not part of the UIKit standard library, but seems to be very common lately.</p>

<p>I've spent considerable time developing applications for the iPhone, but not developing controls like that one. What would be the best approach here:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a new UIView for each tab content, and add the three subviews to the mainview straight away?</li>
<li>create new UIViews only when the user clicks on each of the tabs?</li>
<li>Put all the content in a UIScrollView, and just change the page as the user clicks on each tab?</li>
</ul>

<p>Maybe there are open source controls for this out there? I couldn't find anything.</p>

<p>I thought this was a good compromise - a speedy reaction to the user at first (and in my case memory footprint is at its lowest at this point in my app), and then a response to low memory to avoid being shot.</p>

I have reworked and tested to ensure that this works in your scenario.</p>

<p>Sending Channel - wraps the raw hl7 into your xml structure, and forwards to a channel called ReceiveXML. I have coded this in the Source Transformer, but you should code it where it works for you.</p>

<pre><code>var wrappedHL7 = &lt;MyMessage&gt;&lt;ID&gt;123&lt;/ID&gt;

router.routeMessage(""ReceiveXML"", wrappedHL7);

<p>Receiving Channel - extracts the hl7 from the xml, converts it to xml, and assigns back to the msg object. I have coded this in the source Filter - hence ""return true;""</p>

<pre><code>msg = new XML(SerializerFactory.getHL7Serializer(false,false,true).toXML(msg['hl7v2'].toString()));
return true;

<p>Microsoft's response gives a very easy workaround:</p>

<p>1) Create a subclass of <code>ToolStripSystemRenderer</code>, overriding <code>OnRenderToolStripBorder</code> and making it a no-op:</p>

<pre><code>public class MySR : ToolStripSystemRenderer
{
    public MySR() { }

    protected override void OnRenderToolStripBorder(ToolStripRenderEventArgs e)
    {
        //base.OnRenderToolStripBorder(e);
    }
}

<p>2) Use that renderer for your toolstrip. The renderer must be assigned <em>after</em> any assignment to the toolstrip's RenderMode property or it will be overwritten with a reference to a System.Windows.Forms renderer.</p>

That question led me onto thinking about this but is different enough to warrant its own thread.</p>

<p>I am creating a game (for fun and learning purpose) and would like to know if I am using good standards for design or not.  I think I might have gone OTT on separation of concerns, or just got the whole thing wrong, but I am hoping that isn’t the case.  I have no problem rewriting it as I want to learn “best practices” and the practical application of them.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Let me explain a little more about the game, It is based on Jawbreaker a game found on many mobile phones (<a href=""http://bigfrog.net/jawbreaker/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">quick demo found here</a>).  Objective is to select balls that are in groups to remove them from play and score as many points as possible.</p>

<p>I am trying to expand it a little and have different types of boards, balls move in different ways, and different ball types, the balls may just go where they are told to, or they might do something along the way.</p>

<p>The Objects DLL holds the basic objects used in the game, Balls and a Board.  They do not contain any logic about how they act / react to situations (the ball does implement the CompareTo and the Equals methods).  There could be X number of implementations of IBall (and the same for IBoard, although there will not be that many I imagine).</p>

<p>The InstanceManager DLL is used as a way of Creating Objects, not sure this was 100% needed it could have gone in the Objects DLL.  The Factories are static classes that have various overloaded methods to create IBall objects.  The BallFactory can take the BallType Enum, A Drawing.Color object, etc.  The BoardFactory is very similar.  Jawbreaker is a singleton object that deals with things like holding a Random Object as it is used very regularly and some GameConfiguration data, (not so relevant to this topic).</p>

<p>The Engine DLL is where most of the work happens.  The LogicFactories take the BallType and BoardType objects to create the relevant Logic Objects.  The logic objects are used to control how an IBall and IBoard object works.  The BallLogic tells the ball what it can do when its events fire.  For example when a Ball is selected a method is called on the Ball Logic saying Ball X on Board Y has been selected.  The Ball can then do whatever its type of ball should / could do.  The BoardLogic is very similar and deals with how the board acts.  </p>

<p>The Engine Object is another singleton and is how the GUI would interact with the whole game.  The GUI would not instantiate any of the other objects directly.</p>

<p>So to summarize the IBall and IBoard classes hold just the data about them, the Logic classes deal with all the functionality.</p>

<p>What I would like to know is:</p>

<p>1)  Is this a sensible approach?</p>

<p>2)  Should (in general) Logic be separate from the Objects / data?</p>

<p>3)  Have I gone too far with the separation of concerns?</p>

<p>4)  Any other comments about the design / structure</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>The reason I have used a couple of singletons is partly for simplicity of accessing the data in one place without keeping hold of objects all the time and also just because it is a single game and will not be scaled to either high end or across multiple machines.  I do understand that they are not great and its not something I use regularly, but appreciate the comments. </p>

<p>Thank you for your thoughts and feedback.</p>
","question of design / structure of application and separation of concerns","<design-patterns><separation-of-concerns>","2009-12-17 17:01:07","366","1924176","2","<p>It's hard to critique your design without a better idea of what you are trying to do. I know that it involves balls and boards, but other than that, I have no idea.</p>

<p>Try to avoid singletons as much as possible. Yes, I know that the GoF book lists it, and I know that it is a common pattern, but in my experience it ends up becoming an anti-pattern. </p>

<p>You mention that IBall and IBoard don't have any logic about how they interact. Does that imply that they don't have any methods? Are their methods just getters and setters for their private data? If IBall and IBoard are just structs (or their equivalent), then they don't need to be interfaces. Could you flesh out your description to talk about the kinds of messages that you can send to an IBall and to an IBoard?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2) Should (in general) Logic be separate from the Objects / data?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes. If you have plain old data, then separating the logic from the plain data is fine. Of course, then you're not doing OOP anymore - you are writing procedural code. I think you're struggling with the desire to not hard-code any behavior into Ball. Perhaps some other entity should be responsible for deciding how balls interact, but you still have room for Ball to participate in the decision. This is where the strategy pattern (among other patterns) would come into play. Think about how things work in the real world - how would a physical ball and a physical board coordinate their interactions? If they talked to each other, what would they say? See if you can implement that in your code.</p>

<p>Finally, a word about design. I think it's good to want to ""get the design right."" On the other hand, that's the path towards becoming an <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/05/01.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">architecture astronaut</a>. Consider what problems you currently have with your code base.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it hard to refactor?</li>
<li>Is it hard to add new types of things?</li>
<li>Is too much ""hard-wired""?</li>
</ul>

<p>Design doesn't exist in a vacuum - it is informed by the current state of the world. Just look at some of the crazy cell phone concept art that people come up with, and you'll see good examples of bad design. Cell phones are limited by current technology, and designs that ignore the restrictions of the real world are nothing more than dreams. The same is true in software. Pay attention to what the code is telling you it needs, and you'll do fine.</p>

<p>The more software you write (and finish), the more experience you will have, and the better your sense of aesthetic will become. Don't let fear of ""doing it wrong"" stop you from finishing your software. Persevere, make it work, and then see what you learned from the process.</p>

<p>It is normal for EXEC_BAD_ACCESS to ""crash"" in code paths that do not belong to you.  Most likely <em>your</em> code created the over-released object.</p>

<p>The key part of using NSZombie is running the <code>malloc_history</code> on the command line. You'll get the call stack showing where the over-released object originated from.  For example:

<p><strong>Question</strong>: how can you connect from VS 2008 Pro to a TFS 2010 server?</p>

<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>

<p>Here's how I solved this problem:</p>

<p><strong>Installations</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>when adding a TFS server to Team Explorer, you <strong>MUST</strong> specify the URL as such:

<li>in my case above, it was <code>http://serverX:8080/tfs/AppDev-TestProject</code></li>
<li>you cannot simply add the TFS server name and have VS look for all Project Collections on the server. TFS 2010 has a new URL (by default) and VS 2008 doesn't recognize how to gather that list.</li>

<p>I've made my password field background transparent and I placed <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element ""behind"" the password input, so that it appears to be part of the password field. Now I wrote a standard function for toggling element like this :</p>

<pre><code>function togglePassword(obj) {
                    var el = document.getElementById(obj);
                    if ( el.style.display != 'none' ) {
                        el.style.display = 'none';
                    }
                    else {
                        el.style.display = '';
                    }
                }
</code></pre>

<p>I trigger this function onforus and onblur from password field so that label disappears when the password field is focused but I have problems with onblur, because after I type password and hit TAB on the which takes me to login submit button then the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code> element appears with password value again and its mixed with typed password. <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/VyhKm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/VyhKm.png"" alt=""image""></a>
 Here is the image of that, so I tried to come up with something new.</p>

<pre><code>function togglePassword(obj) {
                var el = document.getElementById(obj);
                        var input_el = document.getElementById('password_field');
                   if(input_el.value.length &gt; 0)
                            {
                                el.style.display = 'none';
                            }
                           else {
                              if ( el.style.display != 'none' ) {
                        el.style.display = 'none';
                        }
                        else {
                            el.style.display = '';

                    }
                               }
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this code doesn't work .. can someone point to me where did I made mistake? So this second code should check whether password field is emtpy or not, if its not empty then continue to toogle if it is don't toggle just hide the password value. Help :D thank you</p>

"1928321","<p>I need to generate a user interface for entering a sales document (eg invoice). I'm trying to use components of ""developer express"" specifically the QuantumGrid component (TcxGrid).

<p>I just need to edit a record (document) at a time and using a pair of objects dataware components (eg TDBEdit) in the header and a grid to handle the detail.</p>

If you setup the relationship in the data components you can simply hook the controls up to the correct DataSource and everything will work.</p>

<p>So if you have two DataSets Customer and Invoice.  The Invoice Master Datasource is the Customer DataSource.  Then on your edit controls you point to the Customer DataSource and you point the Grid to the Invoice DataSource.</p>

<p>If you think about what the Master/Detail relationship is doing it really just filters the records on the Detail DataSet to match the current record on the Master DataSet.  Individual Edit controls will always display the ""current"" record in the DataSet they are connected to.  Grids will show all visible records in the DataSet they are connected to.</p>

<p>I have a tendency to not use Master/Detail relationships in an edit form like you show here.  I'm assuming there is some way on a different screen to pick the invoice to edit.  I usually create a copy of the needed DataSets with only the records needed for this edit.  If I am editing a existing invoice I copy the current records.  If it is a new invoice I can start off with an empty recordset.  It is more work - I have some generic library functions that will copy a DataSet Structure and then copy one or more records into that Dataset.  Depending on your setup you can also requery your Database to just get the records you are interested in.  Obviously that should not be done in all cases.  Another issue with this approach is you need a way to update any other Datasets you may have with this data - i.e. your main search screen.</p>

<p>However, once I get on the edit screen I find it makes things eaiser.  Now I don't need to worry about the master detail relationship at the top level.  If the invoice has internal Master/Detail relationships you can just deal with those, but you know that the DataSets only have the data for this one invoice - not everything in the Database.</p>

<p>In the case of your form if you limit the Data in the DataSets you can just hook everything up directly and it should work as you expect.  You would only have one record in the Customer DataSet and the invoice would just have the records for this Invoice.</p>

<p>IE seems to be a bit messed up as far as the canvas is the wrong size but firefox is going crazy!  What gives with this aspect ratio?  Why does the second half of my arc not appear?
Also, some times firefox just flat out doesn't show anything.</p>

<p><a href=""http://codepaste.net/8bnd2z"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is my code by the way.</a></p>
","drawImage on canvas has weird aspect ratio in firefox and other problems","<javascript><firefox><html><canvas>","2009-12-18 22:59:17","6996","1931592","2","<h1>Aspect ratio problem</h1>

<p>If you don't set a width on the <code>canvas</code> element, it defaults to 300x150. In your CSS, you set the <em>style</em> to 94x120, so it scales the image to that size. To fix it, you need to either set the width and height in the HTML, or with JavaScript.</p>

<h3>In HTML:</h3>

<pre><code>&lt;canvas id=""c"" width=""94"" height=""120""&gt;Ugh, this just ain't gonna work&lt;/canvas&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>In JavaScript (with jQuery):</h3>

<pre><code>$('canvas').attr('width', '94').attr('height', '120');
</code></pre>

<h1>Internet Explorer's incorrect size</h1>

<p>Adding the size to the canvas element should fix this problem too. Since IE is using VML instead of a canvas to render the image, the CSS rule for canvas won't apply. excanvas should see the specified size and apply it in IE.</p>

<h1>Missing the second half of the arc</h1>

<p>The <code>simpleArc</code> function doesn't work in Firefox when the amplitude is negative. The problem is that a negative amplitude results in a negative radius for the arc, which is illegal according to the <a href=""http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-canvas-element.html#dom-context-2d-arc"" rel=""noreferrer"">canvas spec</a>. It should actually throw an <code>INDEX_SIZE_ERR</code> exception, but Firefox just seems to ignore the call.</p>

<p>There are two possible solutions (basically; there are several ways you could accomplish either): when you pass a negative amplitude, either calculate the parameters for the arc taking into account the negative radius (with a different center point and angles, etc.), or change the sign and use transformations to rotate the arc. I implemented the second solution like this:</p>

<pre><code>ctx.simpleArc = function(x,y, length, amplitude) {
    var rotate = false;

    // Check whether we need to rotate the image
    if (amplitude &lt; 0) {
        rotate = true;
        amplitude = -amplitude;
    }
    var radius = amplitude/2+ length*length/(8*amplitude);
    var outerAngle = Math.asin((radius-amplitude)/radius);
    var innerAngle = Math.PI - 2*outerAngle;

    // The translate/rotate/translate steps could be combined into one matrix
    // transformation, but I think this is clearer and less error-prone.
    if (rotate) {
        this.save(); // So we can easily undo the transformation
        this.translate(x + length, y);
        this.rotate(Math.PI);
        this.translate(-length, -y);
    }
    this.arc(x+length/2, y+(radius-amplitude), radius, -(outerAngle+innerAngle), -outerAngle, false);

    // Reset the transformation matrix to its original value
    if (rotate) {
        this.restore();
    }
    return this;
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Firefox not showing anything</h1>

<p>In your code, you create the image and set the source, but it may not be loaded before the rest of the code get's executed. The image loads asynchronously, and when you draw the image onto the canvas, it doesn't wait for it to finish. You will need to call the code that uses the image from an <code>onload</code> event.</p>

<pre><code>var img = $('&lt;img&gt;');
img[0].onload = function() {
    ctx.drawImage(img[0], 0, 0);
    ctx.strokeStyle = ""blue"";
    ctx.simpleStroke(function(ctx) { ctx.simpleArc(0, 70, img_w/2, 3)});
    ctx.simpleStroke(function(ctx) { ctx.simpleArc(img_w / 2, 70, img_w/2, -3)});
};

// I moved this so it happens after you set the `onload` event, because I
// think IE won't call `onload` if it happens to already be loaded.
img.attr('src', 'shortcylinder.png');
</code></pre>

<p>You could also pre-load all the images you will need instead of creating them when you need them. You would still need to prevent the code from running until all the images are loaded.</p>

"1932693","<p>I think that it's easier to explain my problem with an example:</p>

","DSUM: How to define the criteria range using braces?","<excel><excel-formula>","2009-12-19 11:39:34","13911","1932708","4","<p>Based on what's said about D-Functions on <a href=""http://www.cpearson.com/excel/ArrayFormulas.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this page</a>, I think you need to have the criteria in a separate cell.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> If the goal of including the criteria in the formula is to make it more readable, you could work with <a href=""http://www.techonthenet.com/excel/formulas/dsum.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">named ranges</a> instead.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> <em>In response to your comments</em>.<br>
It's not possible to do what you want (include the criteria in the formula) because of how the <code>DSUM()</code> function works. Take a look at the <a href=""http://www.techonthenet.com/excel/formulas/dsum.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation for <code>DSUM</code></a> and compare it with <a href=""http://www.techonthenet.com/excel/formulas/vlookup.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>VLOOKUP</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The syntax for the DSum function is:</p>

<pre><code>DSum( range, field, criteria )
</code></pre>
  
  <p><em>range</em> is the range of cells that you want to apply the criteria against.</p>
  
  <p><em>field</em> is the column to sum the values. You can either specify the numerical position of the column in the list or the column label in double quotation marks.</p>
  
  <p><em>criteria</em> is the <strong>range of cells</strong> that contains your criteria.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note the difference:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The syntax for the VLookup function is:</p>

<pre><code>VLookup( value, table_array, index_number, not_exact_match )
</code></pre>
  
  <p><em>value</em> is the value to search for in the first column of the table_array.</p>
  
  <p><em>table_array</em> is two or more <strong>columns of data</strong> that is sorted in ascending order.</p>
  
  <p><em>index_number</em> is the column number in table_array from which the matching value must be returned. The first column is 1.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As <code>DSUM</code> is looking for a <strong>range of cells</strong> that contain the criteria, there's nothing you can do to avoid passing it just that - a range of cells.</p>

<p>I think the best you can do is define your different criteria as named ranges, which will make it a lot easier to reference the different ones depending on what you want to do in the formula. Unfortunately, if the regular <code>SUM</code> function is not fast enough for you, there's not much else you can do - you <em>will</em> have to specify criteria in cells to use <code>DSUM</code>.</p>

<p>Then I opened Blend and added an instance of UserControl1 to Window1. I right clicked on UserControl1 and said EditTemplate | Edit a Copy.</p>

<p>This created a copy of my user control template in the Window.Resources. From within this new template I went up to the Triggers panel and clicked the button to add a new property trigger.</p>

<p>Right away Blend defaulted to selecting my property in the ""Activated When"" section.</p>

<p>Ok good the screen shot means everything is getting submitted correctly to your php page.
So then as we were suggesting the issue is with your SQL. Since the vote SQL seems to work fine its localized to insert youre trying to perform.</p>

<p>If you could, can you post the sql schema for your ""comments"" table.</p>

<p>also while youre doing thathave you tried runng the same query with a some test data directly form the commandline or a gui client to the sql server?</p>

<p>for example from the commandline:
mysql -u $USER -p $DATABASE
INSERT INTO comments (comment,aid) VALUES ('i have something to say!', $AID);</p>

<p>Where <code>$USER</code> is your username, and <code>$DATABASE</code> is your dbname... youll be prompted for the password for your user of course.</p>

<p>Now im not sure what your schema looks like so if <code>aid</code> is a auto-increment you shouldnt be supplying a value, if its pk something arbitrary but unique for <code>$AID</code> (making sure it fits the column type - ie. int, text, varchar, etc..)</p>

<p>post back your schema and whatever result the test query gives you.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>OK I want you to do this and then ammend your question with the output:</p>

<p>use this code for submission (assuming #comment is still the id of the textarea:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#submit_js"").click(function() {
  $.post(
    ""user_submit.php"", 
    {comment: $(""#comment"").val()}, 
    function(data){
        alert(data);
  });
});
</code></pre>

<p>Put this in your <code>user_submit.php</code> and comment out everything else:</p>

<pre><code>print ""Request Data is:\n"";
print_r($_REQUEST);
print ""\n\nPost data is:\n"";
print_r($_POST);
</code></pre>

<p>Post back what you see in the alert window that pops up.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>i have posted the updated
  user_submit.php. this now even updates
  text in ajax. it is still unable to
  print the comment - amit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think i might know what it is... Exactly what type of element is <code>#comment</code>?
Can you post the relevant HTML from your submission page?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I think youre confused about how ajax works. Youre assuming it works just like if you submit a form to a plain php page, then that page renders to the browser. This is not what happens. Instead you post to a page and you get a http response back, instead of rendering that response to the browser you get it as a javascript variable. Then you have to do something with that variable - like add it to the page somewhere. The problem is you havent done anything with the response youre getting back.</p>

<p>Ok so...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""@BranTheMan: then why isnt it
  echo'ing the text? and why isnt it
  adding anything to the DB? – amit""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Its not echoing anythign in you page because youre not telling it to. What you seen in the firebug console is the response body. That doesnt go into your page with <code>$.post</code>. It jsut makes the call and give you the response. if you want to echo it in the current page then you need to tell it to do so.</p>

<p>for example with the things you listed above:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#submit_js"").click(function() {
  $.post(
      ""user_submit.php"", 
      {comment: $(""#comment"").val()}, 
      function(data){
         $('#submit_js').append($('body', data).html());
      });
});
</code></pre>

<p>As for your SQL i dont know why its not adding properly... it looks fine. Have you checked your logs for any sql errors? Might want to through some error checking on the return from the query.</p>

<p>I've problem in understanding the table. </p>

<p><strong>Q2:</strong> in the 2nd entry of the table. Again, why DX:AX. Why not EAX or EDX?</p>

<p>Now consider following code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>imul eax ; edx:eax = eax * eax
mov ebx, eax ; save answer in ebx
mov eax, square_msg ; square_msg db ""Square of input is "", 0
call print_string ; prints the string eax
mov eax, ebx 
call print_int ;  prints the int stored in eax
call print_nl ; prints new line
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Q3:</strong> Its previsously said that <code>The notation EDX:EAX means to think of the EDX and EAX registers as one 64 bit register with the upper
32 bits in EDX and the lower bits in EAX.</code> So the answer is also stored in edx, right? in the above code we didn't consider any EDX we are just referring to EAX
How is this still working?</p>

<p><strong>Q4:</strong> I've problem with rest of all entries in the table. worst case multiplication result of two n bit numbers(n = 8/16/32 bits) is 2n bits. How come its storing the result of two 16/32 bit multiplication result in register of same size itself?</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/6XI70.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/6XI70.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>The goal is to re-arrange the tiles so that they appear in their natural positions. You can only slide one tile at a time. Each possible state of the puzzle is a node in the search graph.  </p>

<p>For the h(x) function, I am using an aggregate sum, across all tiles, of the tile's dislocation from the goal state.  In the above image, the 5 is at location 0,0, and it belongs at location 1,0, therefore it contributes 1 to the h(x) function.  The next tile is the 11, located at 0,1, and belongs at 2,2, therefore it contributes 3 to h(x).  And so on. <strong>EDIT:</strong> I now understand this is what they call ""Manhattan distance"", or ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">taxicab distance</a>"".</p>

<p>I have been using a step count for g(x). In my implementation, for any node in the state graph, g is just +1 from the prior node's g.  </p>

<p>To find successive nodes, I just examine where I can possibly move the ""hole"" in the puzzle. There are 3 neighbors for the puzzle state (aka node) that is displayed: the hole can move north, west, or east.  </p>

<p>My A* search sometimes converges to a solution in 20s, sometimes 180s, and sometimes doesn't converge at all (waited 10 mins or more).  I think h is reasonable. I'm wondering if I've modeled g properly. In other words, is it possible that my A* function is reaching a node in the graph via a path that is not the shortest path?  </p>

<p>Maybe have I not waited long enough?   Maybe 10 minutes is not long enough?  </p>

<p><strong>For a fully random arrangement, (assuming no parity problems), What is the average number of permutations an A* solution will examine?</strong> (please show the math)</p>

<p>I'm going to look for logic errors in my code, but in the meantime, 
Any tips? </p>

<p>(ps: it's done in Javascript). </p>

<p>Also, no, this isn't CompSci homework.  It's just a personal exploration thing. I'm just trying to learn Javascript. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I've found that the run-time is highly depend upon the heuristic.  I saw the 10x factor applied to the heuristic from the article someone mentioned, and it made me wonder - why 10x?  Why linear?   Because this is done in javascript, I could modify the code to dynamically update an html table with the node currently being considered.   This allowd me to peek at the algorithm as it was progressing.  With a regular taxicab distance heuristic, I watched as it failed to converge. </p>

<p>There were 5's and 12's in the top row, and they kept hanging around.  I'd see 1,2,3,4 creep into the top row, but then they'd drop out, and other numbers would move up there.  What I was hoping to see was 1,2,3,4 sort of creeping up to the top, and then staying there. </p>

<p>I thought to myself - this is not the way I solve this personally. Doing this manually, I solve the top row, then the 2ne row, then the 3rd and 4th rows sort of concurrently.  </p>

<p>So I tweaked the h(x) function to more heavily weight the higher rows and the ""lefter"" columns.  The result was that the A* converged much more quickly.  It now runs in 3 minutes instead of ""indefinitely"".   With the ""peek"" I talked about, I can see the smaller numbers creep up to the higher rows and stay there. Not only does this seem like the right thing, it runs much faster.</p>

<p>I'm in the process of trying a bunch of variations.  It seems pretty clear that A* runtime is very sensitive to the heuristic.  Currently the best heuristic I've found uses the summation of  <code>dislocation * ((4-i) + (4-j))</code> where i and j are the row and column, and dislocation is the taxicab distance. </p>

<p>One interesting part of the result I got: with a particular heuristic I find a path very quickly, but it is obviously not the shortest path.  I think this is because I am weighting the heuristic.  In one case I got a path of 178 steps in 10s. My own manual effort produce a solution in 87 moves. (much more than 10s).  More investigation warranted. </p>

<p>So the result is I am seeing it converge must faster, and the path is definitely not the shortest.  I have to think about this more. </p>

You aren't looking for the <em>best</em> solution, but the <em>fastest</em> solution. Therefore, you can optimize your algorithm by returning the first solution, by weighting the number of moves lower than your heuristic function, and the heuristic can return an over-estimate.</p>

<p>The heuristic function itself is typically best modeled by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry"" rel=""noreferrer"">Manhattan distance</a> and linear conflict. Manhattan distance is well explained in other answers and in the Wikipedia article, and you seem to have a handle on it. Linear conflict adds two to the manhattan distance for each pair of blocks that would have to be swapped to reach a solution. For example, if a row contains ""3 2 1 4"", then the one and the three have to be swapped, and one would have to be moved to another row to do so.</p>

<p>Just taking over WM_PAINT and WM_ERASEBKGROUND aren't good enough, because the control will sometimes paint on other messages as well. </p>

<p>You are better off just writing your own edit control.  I know that's a huge amount of work, but in the long run it will be less work than trying to hack your way into taking over all of the Edit controls' drawing code. </p>

<p>I remember back in the good old days when everyone use to subclass the button control to add color and graphics, etc.  The thing is, one day I sat down and just wrote my own button window class. and it was LESS CODE than what we had in our source tree to subclass and custom draw the Windows button.</p>

<p>I've always preferred fixed-width layouts over fluid-width layouts, one of the main reasons is that I'm able to better understand how the whole picture will be without having to worry about the screen resolution.</p>

<p>But now the ""picture"" has changed, <strong>there is a high discrepancy between the lowest and highest resolutions used by most users nowadays</strong> and they seem to be here to stay.</p>

<p>I've a netbook that only supports 800 pixels or <strong>1024 pixels</strong> wide; I also have a 22"" monitor that supports <strong>1650 pixels</strong> and, 24"" monitors that support <strong>1920 pixels</strong> and more are becoming pretty common.</p>

<p>I've pretty much ""ignored"" the 800 pixels users for some time and I've been developing with fixed 950/960 pixels wide, I also notice that popular sites (<a href=""http://www.stackoverflow.com/"">SO</a> for one) either use this approach or the fluid one.</p>

<p>For text (almost) only websites (like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>) I don't see a problem using the fluid system but what about all the other <strong>websites that depend on images / video to create interesting content</strong>? Social Networks, Classifieds, and so on... What is (will be) their approach to address this issue?</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Seam Carving</a> seems like a good option for the near future but it hasn't matured enough (neither browsers nor jQuery nativelly support it at this point in time), I also feel like users wouldn't understand it, get confused with it and as a consequence abandon the website.</p>

<p>The <em>de facto</em> standard on the web is still 1024 pixels wide, and leaving <strong>980 pixels unused</strong> in a 24"" monitor just seems plain odd not to say wrong. <strong>So what are our options?</strong></p>

","Is it wise to use a Fluid Layout?","<css><fixed><fluid>","2009-12-26 10:09:31","1392","1973486","8","<p>I generally think that fluid layouts are a good idea. The problem starts when your fluid layout starts to get really wide with high resolution screens - there is a limit to how far the human eye can track horizontally without losing the vertical positioning. That is why newspaper columns, for example, are always rather narrow.</p>

<p>Try to look at wikipedia in a high resolution screen, and you'll see that they limit the maximum width to something around 800-900px - more then that (assuming a rather standard 12pt font) and people stop being able to read until the end of the line and then effortlessly find the start of the next line, and the whole thing breaks into a mess of eye and neck strain.</p>

<p>On web sites I build, I use max-width to limit the maximum width of the text content (and in that I also include images and other stuff) to about 720-800px, which with sidebars and such can possibly get to around 1000px. If the screen is wider then that, then either center the content of left align it (right align on RTL web sites) - both work well.</p>

<p>But you have to design your layout so that it flows when the available width is narrower - this is very useful for people with netbooks (which are rather popular now and I expect will become more popular in the future), smart phones and even small screen mobile devices. Such mobile devices more and more feature standard browsers and you should address this in your designs - even if a mobile browsers can reduce your website somehow, the ""mobile mode"" usually does this by messing up the page and killing your intended user-experience.</p>

<p>I have a webpage and i want to get images from another site. However i would like to prevent users to knowing which site. It doesnt need to be perfect just 'good enough'. Is there a way i can write <img src=""/redirect/id.jpg""> and have the browser get the image from another domain? If the user right clicks and hits view image i would like it to say mysite.com/redirect/id.jpg and not the new url. Is there a way to do this?</p>

<p>So far my only idea was to use WebClient to get the data from their server and send it out. But that would kill bandwidth. I dont need it to be perfectly hidden just good enough.</p>
","Redirect without changing urls?","<http><http-redirect>","2009-12-27 01:29:46","358","1964920","3","<p>Use CSS <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/css/pr_background-image.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>background-image</code></a> style on a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> instead of an <code>img</code> tag.  Since CSS backgrounds don't respond to ""right-click..Properties"" like <code>img</code> tags do, a casual viewer won't know the image location from right-click (although it will be visible via ""view source"").  </p>

<p>If you want to prevent view-source exposure too, you can also obfuscate one step further by pointing the <code>background-image</code> to a URL on your site which then redirects to the image you want.  If you do this, then the only way the user will know where the image came from is to use Fiddler, Firebug, or another tool which can actually dig into the DOM or the HTTP stream.  This won't perform as well as the CSS-only approach, but it's pretty cheap since you won't be tying up a thread on your server waiting for the remote server to respond. </p>

<p>BTW, if you're also concerned about the target site being annoyed that you're borrowing their content, be aware that the HTTP <code>Referer:</code> header of clients will let the target site the URL of your site that is ""borrowing"" the image.  It will be easy for them to cut you off if they so desire by blocking all requests from your referring site.  You can of course get around this (e.g. by requesting the pages from your own client on your server) but then the site can just look up your IP addresses and block you.  Moral of the story: if you want to ""borrow"" content from another site, keep it low-key and low-volume, because if you attract their attention you'll get banned.  </p>

<p>Or (this is the ideal) contact the site and let them know what you're doing and work out an arrangement so they won't block you if your site becomes popular!</p>

<p>I resolved it by manually writing every file into the main .pro file, which is not that much harder, but I still wonder - how exactly .pri files work, and why the solution linked above didn't add the folders, but only the .pri files, so it looked like this in Qt creator:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/80VN6.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/80VN6.png"" alt=""Qt creator screenshot""></a></p>

<p>So, my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the general format of the .pri files?</li>
<li>Why the solution above doesn't work?</li>
</ul>
","Using .pri files in Qt","<qt><qt-creator>","2009-12-28 01:27:38","52016","1970803","3","<p>My guess from looking at your screenshot is that QtCreator doesn't find the header files listed in the .pri file. If your .pri file is located in a different directory than your .pro file (which seems to be the case here), Qt looks for the files listed in the .pri file in the same directory as the .pri file (not the .pro file), and any relative path will be resolved from that directory.</p>

<p>When a file can't be found, QtCreator silently ignores it and simply doesn't add it to the folder in the projects view. If, for example, you used the full path for line.h, circle.h and bezier.h in your include.pri file, as soon as you save the file, you'll see them appear in the projects view. The key now is simply to figure out what is the appropriate relative path pointing to those files relative to the .pri file.</p>

"1969132","<p>I have a view that basically just returns all records from a table, and adds a column 'isodate' which is supposed to be the date in ISO-Format.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW [dbo].[v_bedarfe]

GO
</code></pre>

<p>The ""datum""-field is smalldatetime.
The results of a query on isodat were...'surprising', so to make the point clear, I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>select top 10 datum,isodat,convert(varchar(16),datum,20) As isodat2 from v_bedarfe
</code></pre>

<p>which led to:</p>

<p>and that looks very wrong. </p>

<p>So I assume I have wrong expectations or am 'abusing' something here, but I don't see what I could be doing wrong and would appreciate any suggestions how to get back on track here...</p>

"1971312","<p>So I'm happily working on a project making heavy use of custom .xml configuration files this morning.</p>

<p>All of a sudden, whenever I double-click an .xml file in Solution Explorer, it opens in Notepad instead of within Visual Studio.</p>

<p>Thinking that it was the Windows file associations, I right-clicked on a file in Explorer, selected Open With >> Choose Defaults, and selected Visual Studio 2008.</p>

<p>But the problem remains -- now when I open a file from Explorer, Visual Studio Opens, <em>then</em> it opens Notepad.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this is very frustrating, and Google is not much help. Has anyone else ever had this problem, and what did you do about it?</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>This only happens for .xml files. Other text files (.config, .txt) open within Visual Studio just fine.</li>
<li>This has nothing to do with <em>Windows</em> file associations, as Windows open up VS2008 just as it should. This is some crazy problem internal to Visual Studio.</li>
<li>I've also tried Tools >> Options >> General >> Restore File Associations. No luck.</li>
<li>Nothing present in Tools >> Options >> Text Editor >> File Extension</li>
<li>This is what my ""Open With"" menu looks like for .xml files. As you can see, ""XML Editor"" is set to the default.

<p>The problem arises when you have noise. Shapes that were labelled but aren't of your interest.

"1975484","<p>Apologies for the less than ideal title; had a hard time coming up with something.</p>
<p>Three entities: <code>Products</code>, <code>Clients</code> and <code>Client_Product_Authorization</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>Client</code> has access to many <code>Products</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>Product</code> is accessed by many <code>Clients</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>Client_Product_Authorization</code> authorizes a <code>Client</code> to access a <code>Product</code>.</p>
<p>We have 100,000+ <code>Products</code> (virtual goods) and managing <code>Client_Product_Authorizations</code> becomes a very labor intensive task. So we have <code>Products</code> that is a container of other <code>Products</code>. Example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Product X is a container for Products 1 through 2000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, by creating a <code>Client_Product_Authorization</code> granting a <code>Client</code> the <code>Product</code> X, we are indirectly providing for the client to access products 1 through 2000. Mind that product 1 might be contained in different container products (so, yes, it is a many-to-many self relationship).</p>
<p>Here is the entity level data model:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/cemQv.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/cemQv.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></a></p>

<p><strong>The advantage</strong> of this mechanism is that we can just change the composition of <code>Product</code> X (adding or removing other products) and it automatically adjusts the product list available to the clients authorized to <code>Product</code> X. Managing awarding access to our large product-base is a matter of selecting a few container products.</p>
<p><strong>The disadvantage</strong> is that it now became harder (in terms of creating a SQL statement, because of the many-to-many self-relationship) to know what the <code>Client</code> is actually authorized to see (as in the individual non-container products). As in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Product Z is a container for Product X and Product Y</p>
<p>Product X is a container for Products 1 through 2000</p>
<p>Product Y is a container for Products 2001 through 5000</p>
<p>What are the actual non-container products a client authorized to Product Z can see?</p>
<p>Products 1 through 2000 and 2001 through 5000.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would like to make the list of non-container products a client is authorized for to be materialized in some way. So that questions like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Should <code>Client</code> ABC be allowed to see <code>Product</code> 78?</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>What products is <code>Client</code> ABC authorized to see?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>can be easily responded with a query.</p>
<p><strong>The goal</strong> is to make the job of software trying to determine the list of products accessible to a client a simple mechanism, instead of requiring a traversal through all container products, their sub-container products, etc etc etc.</p>
<h2>Three questions:</h2>
<p>a) Is there a better data-model for this scenario?</p>
<p>b) Is there a different mechanism to simplify the management of access authorization for this large set of products?</p>
<p>c) How would you go about making the obtention of the list of non-container products available to a client as simple as possible?</p>
<p>I appreciate the collective's input. Thanks in advance!</p>

New paradigm for implementation?","<sql><sql-server-2005><database-design><data-modeling>","2009-12-29 16:25:49","191","1975527","2","<p>Since you're using SQL 2005 you should have access to common table expressions (CTEs) which makes the recursion of finding the children of a product much easier. You might want to look into CTEs and see if that's sufficient for what you're doing.</p>

<p>Also, I don't recall this specific scenario and my copy of the book is at home, but Joe Celko wrote a <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1558609202"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very good book on modeling hierarchies and trees in an RDBMS</a>. It's probably worth looking into to see if there is a better model for this. He had a few rather ingenious ones for other scenarios that didn't seem obvious at first, but which are very efficient. Even if there isn't a direct match, some of the techniques which he uses might be useful.</p>

<p>The model which you have is what's referred to as the adjacency list model. Celko also shows how to model hierarchies using what are called the nested set model and the path enumeration model.</p>

<p>The nested set model may seem a little complicated at first, but it's actually simple in a way. It's more expensive for updating, but selects from it are VERY fast compared to just about any other way to model hierarchies. You can find an abbreviated description of it <a href=""http://www.developersdex.com/gurus/articles/112.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. Since a product can be contained in multiple trees you would have to adapt it slightly for your case.</p>

<p>The path enumeration model basically just uses a delimited (or XML) string to list out the path to the row in question, starting at the root of the tree. You then use string (or XQuery) functions to find children of a parent, etc. As far as I know, it's only really useful for trees, which have a single root, so I don't think that you could use it in your case.</p>

<p>Instead of writing phone links in anchors like this <em>tel:myphonenumber</em>, i write <em>allo:myphonenumber</em>.</p>

<p>Thus, the <strong>shouldStartLoadWithRequest</strong> method is called. And i can substitute <em>allo:</em> by <em>tel:</em> in my <code>NSURLRequest</code> object.</p>

<p>edit, here is the code :</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)webView:(UIWebView *)webView
    shouldStartLoadWithRequest:(NSURLRequest *)request

      NSURL *requestURL = [[ request URL] retain];
      // Check to see what protocol/scheme the requested URL is.

      if ( 
          // ( [ [ requestURL scheme ] isEqualToString: @""http"" ] || [ [ requestURL scheme ] isEqualToString: @""https"" ] ) &amp;&amp;

<p>The screenshot shows the debugger reporting buttonType as 2 but the console showing button type = 0.  The same variable is being shown in the debugger and the console.  Any idea how this mismatch happens?</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) po ((UIButton *)control).buttonType

<p>There is no member named buttonType.</p>

<pre><code>    NSLog(@""################ CALL OUT ACCESSORY TAPPED: set pinColor to RED in call out accessory tapped"");
    NSLog(@""################ CALL OUT ACCESSORY TAPPED: UIButtonTypeDetailDisclosure = %d"",UIButtonTypeDetailDisclosure);
    NSLog(@""################ CALL OUT ACCESSORY TAPPED: control button type = %d"", ((UIButton *)control).buttonType);

        NSLog(@"" ############# CALL OUT ACCESSORY TAPPED: in buttonType = disclosure"");
        leftCallOutButton.available = YES;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The if statements evaluates to false!! Trying to understand why if buttonType is being reported as 2 (and if fact is created with type 2 )</p>

<p>as request by Mike:</p>

<pre><code>(gdb) p (int) [((UIButton *)control) buttonType]

<p>Ok, so this makes more sense.  The question now is why is the buttonType being changed from 2 to 0?  Its created with buttonType 2 and somehow gets changed to 0.  Any ideas??</p>

"1987284","<p>So I'm architecting an application that does necessarily C++ work, but MFC/ATL is too messy for my liking, so I had this brilliant idea of doing all the ""thinking"" code in native C++ and all the pretty UI code in C#. The problem, though, is interoperability between the two of them. Before I get too carried away with this, I was wondering if this is a solved problem, and there's a really good way to do this. Note that I don't want to mix logic and display in the same module, as it gives rise to annoyingly high coupling.</p>

<p>Here's what I have so far:</p>

<p>It's very easy to wrap a native C++ class in a <code>ref class</code> that's usuable directly from a C# user interface.</p>

<p>That being said - this was my plan, originally, in my current project.  My thinking was that I'd need the native code for some of the heavy math work we typically do.  I've found, however, that it's been easier, faster, and nicer to just move most of my logic directly into C# (separated from the UI code, but still in a C# assembly) rather than try to implement it in C++.</p>

<p>My experience has been that speed has not been an issue - unsafe C# code has nearly always managed to be as fast or faster than the equivelent C++ when tuned, and it's easier to profile and tune the C# code.</p>

One way around this would be to have a default, hidden checkbox containing a known value that you could filter out selected initially for each question (a ""not answered"" checkbox, if you will).  That would guarantee that you get a selection for each question and that a request parameter exists for each element in the array.</p>

<p>Think about it from the perspective of what gets posted back.  Only those elements that have values, have names, and aren't disabled get posted.  If not all the questions have values, then how many array items should it create?  At best it can guess that the last item selected should be the size of the array -- but what values should it use for any items in between?  The framework can't read your mind and, arguably, shouldn't though providing the default value for the type might be reasonable.  IMO, it would be better to just omit the value and, thus, force the developer to provide the default if desired.  That seems to be what is happening.</p>

<p>You cannot exactly sort data <em>using</em> a <code>DataGridView</code>, but you can set the display order of data in a <code>DataGridView</code>.</p>

<p>Set the <code>SortedColumn</code> property of your <code>DataGridView</code> object to the <code>DataGridViewColumn</code> by which you want your data sorted. If you need a more complex sorting order, you might want to call the <code>Sort</code> method with a custom <code>IComparer</code>. Refer to the MSDN documentation for details.</p>

<p>Or do you actually want to <em>filter</em> your data by the two criteria for which there is an input line in your screenshot? In that case, I'm not exactly sure about the best solution. Probably you need to iterate through all <code>DataGridViewRow</code>s and set each row's visibility depending on the entered criteria:</p>

<pre><code>For Each row As DataGridViewRow in dgv.Rows
    row.Visible = {some condition}
Next

"1993518","<p>I am using Jquery to get googlemap data and load it into a div. My googlemap comes from the <a href=""http://mvcmaps.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MVCMaps</a> control which is located on a usercontrol. My code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>$.get('&lt;%= Url.Action(""GetMapHtml"", ""Post"") %&gt;', function(data) {
     $('#MapWndCont').html(data);
});
</code></pre>

<p>My controller method:</p>

<pre><code> public ActionResult GetMapHtml()
 {
     return PartialView(""MapHtml"", null);
 }

<p>After the AJAX call completes and the data is received, as seen below (which is correct and shows up properly when shown static:</p>

</p>

<p>These are 2 more GET requests that are made from scripts loaded from the google map. The moment they are fired, my page goes blank and nothing at all shows up. The body element is also removed. In the image where you see the second ajax call. After that, the whole page is wiped of html and scripts. So scripts after that call is being executed and they cannot be found.</p>

<p>All help is appreciated in correcting this and having my google maps dynamically loaded.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>EDIT: I have been told by BinaryKitten on #JQuery chat on freenode. document.ready() was in the data of the ajax call. Now my problem is removing that from the MVCMAPS control.</p>

"1993671","<p>I am setting peroperty Margin and Padding of a window and it doesn't take effect:</p>

<p>Result:<br>
<img src=""https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2706/4238552347_4c9736c608_o.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The desired result is that the red frame of the lable should be away 44px from the window's frame (margin+padding).</p>

<p>Yes, I know I can set the margin of the label, but that's not what I want.
I have a whole project that all its windows are set to a style, I want to set this properties (or other) in the general window style.  </p>

<p>I guess if I won't find any solution I will create a named style for greed where I will set the margin/padding, then I will go Window by window and set the Grid's style, but that's the last option I wanna do.<br>
Thanks in advance. </p>
","Window.Margin & Window.Padding don't work","<wpf><xaml><window><padding><margin>","2010-01-03 02:00:49","10699","1993736","2","<p>It's not surprising that Margin doesn't work, because Margin is the amount of space to be placed <em>around</em> the control.  For a Window, this would mean making the frame smaller (and offset), not the client area, and that would be a bit strange (and might not play nicely with the Win32 hosting environment, not sure).  It <em>is</em> a bit surprising that Padding doesn't work, and I'm not sure why that would be.</p>

<p>However, there is a workaround which you can encapsulate in a style: replace the default Window ControlTemplate with your own template that does respect the Padding:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ControlTemplate TargetType=""Window""&gt;
  &lt;Border Background=""White"" Padding=""{TemplateBinding Padding}""&gt;
    &lt;ContentPresenter /&gt;
  &lt;/Border&gt;
&lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(You would probably want the Border Background to be the dynamic window background brush for production code, but you get the idea.)</p>

<p>Obviously you can put this template in a style Template setter so as to avoid having to repeat it on each Window.</p>

<p>Here is the full template (generated with Microsoft Expression):  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;Style x:Key=""WindowStyle"" TargetType=""{x:Type Window}""&gt;

<p>So next consider the fact that it wants to find the Sites by SiteID_i, and what kind of join you want this to be.</p>

<p>How about a Merge Join? That would be nice, but requires the data to be sorted on both sides. That's fine if the indexes are in the right order... </p>

<p>...and after that, you want to be finding stuff based on the Path. So how about:</p>

CREATE INDEX ix_usp on [dbo].[SitePath_T] (SiteID_i) INCLUDE (Path_v);

<pre><code>CREATE INDEX ix_sp on [dbo].[SitePath_T] (Path_v) INCLUDE (SiteID_i);

<p>There may be a Nested Loop used on this final one, but that's hopefully not too bad. The thing that's going to impact your system will be the first two indexes, which should let you see a Merge Join between the two tables in your EXISTS clause.</p>

"1999514","<p>I'm getting confused with what happens on the stack and heap in respect to value type properties in classes.</p>

<p>My understanding so far:</p>

<p>When you create a class with a structure (value type) like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Foo
{
  private Bar _BarStruct;
  public Bar BarStruct
  {
    get {return _BarStruct; }
    set {_BarStruct = value; }
   }
}

private struct Bar
{
  public int Number;
  Bar()
  {
    Number = 1;
  }
  Bar(int i)
  {
    Number = i;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you create a class instance like so:</p>

<pre><code>Foo fooObj = new Foo();
</code></pre>

<p>The stack and heap will look like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i962.photobucket.com/albums/ae105/acardy/stackheap-1.jpg"" alt=""https://i962.photobucket.com/albums/ae105/acardy/stackheap-1.jpg(https://i962.photobucket.com/albums/ae105/acardy/stackheap-1.jpg)""></p>

<p>...where the Bar structure is embeded in the Foo class in the heap. This makes sense to me, but I start to loose it when we consider modifying the Number integer in the BarStruct class, within the Foo Object. For example:</p>

<pre><code>Foo fooObj = new Foo();
fooObj.BarStruct.Number = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>As I understand, this should be returning a copy of BarStruct to live on the stack, which means that any changes of a member of BarStruct would not be carried through to the object, which is why the last line above gives an error.</p>

<p>Is this right so far?</p>

<p>If so, my question is, how come an assignment such as this:</p>

<pre><code>fooObj.BarStruct = new Bar(2);
</code></pre>

<p>...is valid and changes the heap value? Surely this is just changing the value on the stack?? Also, (by and by) I find it so confusing that you are able to use new on a value type. To me, new is for allocatting on the heap (as per C++) and feels unnatural to be doing this for items on the stack.</p>

<p>So just to re-iterate the question, Am I correct in my assumption of what happens when a property containing a structure is called and why can you assign a new structure to a copy and yet it still changes the reference on the heap?</p>

<p>Really hope this all make sense.</p>

<p>Yell if you need clarification!</p>

<p>Ta,</p>

<p>Andy. </p>

<p>The assignment isn't changing the value on the stack - it's calling the <em>setter</em> for the property.</p>

<p>In other words, whereas your first assignment is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>fooObj.get_BarStruct().Number = 1; // Bad
</code></pre>

<p>the second is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>fooObj.set_BarStruct(new Bar(2));
</code></pre>

<p>Does that help?</p>

<p>Note that the problematic assignment becomes a non-issue if you make your value type immutable to start with - which helps in general, in fact. Mutable value types are a really bad idea in C#; you can get into no end of trouble with them.</p>

<p>In terms of your expectations of ""new"" - try not to think in C++, basically. C# isn't C++, and various things (destructors, generics, behaviour during construction) will confuse you if you try to effectively write C++ in C#. A ""new"" statement creates a new instance of a type, whether that's a value type or a reference type.</p>

"2001375","<p><strong>Question:</strong> What are some other strategies on avoiding magic numbers or hard-coded values in your SQL scripts or stored procedures?</p>

<p>Consider a stored procedure whose job is to check/update a value of a record based on its <code>StatusID</code> or some other FK lookup table or range of values.</p>

<p>Consider a <code>Status</code> table where the ID is most important, as it's a FK to another table:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/aRFc6.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The SQL scripts that are to be avoided are <em>something like</em>:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE  @ACKNOWLEDGED tinyint

SELECT  @ACKNOWLEDGED = 3   --hardcoded BAD

UPDATE  SomeTable
SET     CurrentStatusID = @ACKNOWLEDGED
WHERE   ID = @SomeID
</code></pre>

<p>The problem here is that this is not portable and is explicitly dependent on the hard-coded value. Subtle defects exist when deploying this to another environment with identity inserts off.</p>

<p>Also trying to avoid a <code>SELECT</code> based on the text description/name of the status:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE  SomeTable
SET     CurrentStatusID = (SELECT ID FROM [Status] WHERE [Name] = 'Acknowledged')
WHERE   ID = @SomeID
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> What are some other strategies on avoiding magic numbers or hard-coded values in your SQL scripts or stored procedures?</p>

<p>Some other thoughts on how to achieve this:</p>

<ul>
<li>add a new <code>bit</code> column (named like 'IsAcknowledged') and sets of rules where there can be only one row with a value of <code>1</code>. This would help in finding the unique row: <code>SELECT ID FROM [Status] WHERE [IsAcknowledged] = 1)</code></li>
</ul>
","SQL: avoiding hard-coding or magic numbers","<sql><t-sql><stored-procedures>","2010-01-04 18:50:46","9710","2001472","11","<p>At some level, there's going to be some ""hard coding"" of values. The idea of eliminating them comes from two sides:</p>

<ol>
<li>Making the code more readable (i.e., saying <code>'Acknowledged'</code> rather than <code>3</code> is <em>probably</em> going to make your intentions more obvious to the reader.</li>
<li>Making the code more dynamic, where one function can take a parameter rather than several functions that don't (this is a simplification obviously, but the meaning should be fairly self-evident anyway)</li>
</ol>

<p>Making <code>bit</code> columns for various states can be a good or bad idea; it really just depends on the data. If the data goes through various ""stages"" (Received, Acknowledged, Under Review, Rejected, Accepted, Responded, etc.) then that approach quickly scales itself out of viability (not to mention the irritating process of having to ensure that <em>only one</em> of the columns is set to 1 at any given time). If, on the other hand, the state is really as simple as you describe, then doing that can make the code more readable and indexes perform better.</p>

<p>The biggest no-no in hard coding values is <em>hard coding values that reference other entities</em> (in other words, hard coding the primary key for a corresponding object). The string <code>'Acknowledged</code>' is still a hard-coded value, it's just more transparent in its meaning and it isn't a reference to something else. For me, it boils down to this: <strong>if you can (reasonably) look it up, do it</strong>. If you can't (or if something makes it an unreasonable task either from a performance or maintainability perspective), hard code it. Using this, you can look up the value of 3 by using <code>Acknowledged</code>; you can't look up <code>Acknowledged</code> from anything else.</p>

"2002521","<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I am attempting to implement supervised learning over a data set within a Java GUI application. The user will be given a list of items or 'reports' to inspect and will label them based on a set of available labels. Once the supervised learning is complete, the labelled instances will then be given to a learning algorithm. This will attempt to order the rest of the items on how likely it is the user will want to view them. </p>

<p>To get the most from the user's time I want to pre-select the reports that will provide the most information about the entire collection of reports, and have the user label them. As I understand it, to calculate this, it would be necessary to find the sum of all the mutual information values for each report, and order them by that value. The labelled reports from supervised learning will then be used to form a Bayesian network to find the probability of a binary value for each remaining report.</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong>  </p>

<hr>

<p>Here, an artificial example may help to explain, and may clear up confusion when I've undoubtedly used the wrong terminology :-) Consider an example where the application displays news stories to the user. It chooses which news stories to display first based on the user's preference shown. Features of a news story which have a correlation are <code>country of origin</code>, <code>category</code> or <code>date</code>. So if a user labels a single news story as interesting when it came from Scotland, it tells the machine learner that there's an increased chance other news stories from Scotland will be interesting to the user. Similar for a category such as Sport, or a date such as December 12th 2004.</p>

<p>This preference could be calculated by choosing any order for all news stories (e.g. by category, by date) or randomly ordering them, then calculating preference as the user goes along. What I would like to do is to get a kind of ""head start"" on that ordering by having the user to look at a small number of specific news stories and say if they're interested in them (the supervised learning part). To choose which stories to show the user, I have to consider the entire collection of stories. This is where Mutual Information comes in. For each story I want to know how much it can tell me about all the other stories when it is classified by the user. For example, if there is a large number of stories originating from Scotland, I want to get the user to classify (at least) one of them. Similar for other correlating features such as category or date. The goal is to find examples of reports which, when classified, provide the most information about the other reports.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>Because my math is a bit rusty, and I'm new to machine learning I'm having some trouble converting the definition of Mutual Information to an implementation in Java. Wikipedia describes the equation for Mutual Information as:</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/b/f/ebf36c4eb951e4273107124ff4c1f2ae.png"" alt=""mutual information equation""></p>

<p>However, I'm unsure if this can actually be used when nothing has been classified, and the learning algorithm has not calculated anything yet.</p>

<p>As in my example, say I had a large number of new, unlabelled instances of this class:  </p>

<pre><code>public class NewsStory {
    private String countryOfOrigin;
    private String category;
    private Date date;
    // constructor, etc.
}
</code></pre>

<p>In my specific scenario, the correlation between fields/features is based on an <em>exact match</em> so, for instance, one day and 10 years difference in date are equivalent in their inequality. </p>

<p>The factors for correlation (e.g. is date more correlating than category?) are not necessarily equal, but they can be predefined and constant. Does this mean that the result of the function <code>p(x,y)</code> <em>is</em> the predefined value, or am I mixing up terms?</p>

<p><strong>The Question</strong> <em>(finally)</em></p>

<hr>

<p>How can I go about implementing the mutual information calculation given this (fake) example of news stories? Libraries, javadoc, code examples etc. are all welcome information. Also, if this approach is fundamentally flawed, explaining why that is the case would be just as valuable an answer.</p>

<hr>

<p>PS. I am aware of libraries such as Weka and Apache Mahout, so just mentioning them is not really useful for me. I'm still searching through documentation and examples for both these libraries looking for stuff on Mutual Information specifically. What would really help me is pointing to resources (code examples, javadoc) where these libraries help with mutual information.</p>

<p>""Given a list of unlabeled examples, sort the list by how much the predictive accuracy of the model would improve if the user labelled the example and added it to the training set.""</p>

<p>If this is the case, I don't think mutual information is the right thing to use because you can't calculate MI between two instances. The definition of MI is in terms of random variables and an individual instance isn't a random variable, it's just a value.</p>

<p>The features and the class label can be though of as random variables. That is, they have a distribution of values over the whole data set. You can calculate the mutual information between two features, to see how 'redundant' one feature is given the other one, or between a feature and the class label, to get an idea of how much that feature might help prediction. This is how people usually use mutual information in a supervised learning problem. </p>

<p>I think ferdystschenko's suggestion that you look at active learning methods is a good one.</p>

<hr>

<p>In response to Grundlefleck's comment, I'll go a bit deeper into terminology by using his idea of a Java object analogy...</p>

<p>Collectively, we have used the term 'instance', 'thing', 'report' and 'example' to refer to the object being clasified. Let's think of these things as instances of a Java class (I've left out the boilerplate constructor):</p>

<pre><code>
class Example
{ String f1;
  String f2;
}

Example e1 = new Example(""foo"", ""bar"");
Example e2 = new Example(""foo"", ""baz"");
</code></pre>

<p>The usual terminology in machine learning is that e1 is an <em>example</em>, that all examples have two <em>features</em> f1 and f2 and that for e1, f1 takes the value 'foo' and f2 takes the value 'bar'. A collection of examples is called a <em>data set</em>.</p>

<p>Take all the values of f1 for all examples in the data set, this is a list of strings, it can also be thought of as a distribution. We can think of the feature as a <em>random variable</em> and that each value in the list is a sample taken from that random variable. So we can, for example, calculate the MI between f1 and f2. The pseudocode would be something like:
<code><pre>
mi = 0
for each value x taken by f1:
{  sum = 0
   for each value y taken by f2:
   {  p_xy = number of examples where f1=x and f2=y
      p_x = number of examples where f1=x
      p_y = number of examples where f2=y
      sum += p_xy * log(p_xy/(p_x*p_y))
   }
   mi += sum
}
</code></pre></p>

<p>However you can't calculate MI between e1 and e2, it's just not defined that way.</p>

","list onclick event problem in php","<php><list><onclick>","2010-01-05 16:15:45","2750","2007432","6","<p>Pretty simple: Your PHP code is executed <strong>ONCE</strong> when you access the site.</p>

<p>So for example the result of this block</p>

<pre><code>while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)){
        echo ""&lt;li onclick=\""toggle('hidden','hidden2','hidden3');\""&gt;"".$row['name'].'&lt;li&gt;';
        $query2 = ""SELECT * FROM site WHERE eid = '"".$row['id'].""'"";

        //$result2 = mysql_query($query2) or die(""query2 result error"".mysql_error());
        $result2 = mysql_query($query2) or die(""query2 result error"".mysql_error());
}
</code></pre>

<p>is that <code>$result2</code> holds all the sites of the last company in your list. This is then used in the next loop to generate the corresponding list of sites. Look at the source  of the generated HTML file. </p>

<p>PHP is a server side language, the code is executed at the server and it is not re-executed by your Javascript functions (i.e. not executed in the browser).</p>

<p>What you are after is dynamically loading the data from your server with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AJAX</a> and pass into the generated HTML.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>You could also do it without Ajax: Rewrite your PHP like this:</p>

<pre><code>$sitequeries = array()
while($row = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)){
        echo ""&lt;li onclick=\""showSites('sites_$row['id']');\""&gt;"".$row['name'].'&lt;li&gt;';
        $query = ""SELECT * FROM site WHERE eid = '"".$row['id'].""'"";
        $sitequeries[$row['id']] = mysql_query($query2 or die(""query2 result error"".mysql_error());
}
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    foreach($sitequeries as $id =&gt; $query) {
        echo ""&lt;ul class='sites' id='sites_$id'&gt;"";

        while($row2 = mysql_fetch_assoc($query)){
            //...
        }
        echo ""&lt;/ul&gt;"";
    }
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is not a working example but should give you the right idea. You have to adjust your JS accordingly to show only the corresponding lists, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>function showSites(id) {
   // Hide all lists with class 'site' here and only display the list with id 'id' e.g. 'sites_5'
}
</code></pre>

<p>But note that this is not a good solution if you have a lot of companies, site, employes, etc. as the generation of the HTML may take a while. Then Ajax is a better choice. </p>

<p>Raymond gives the example of a bug in a sound card driver:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The original function, called at
  hardware interrupt time, looks like
  this in the DDK:</p>

<pre><code>void FAR PASCAL midiCallback(NPPORTALLOC pPortAlloc, WORD msg,
                             DWORD dwParam1, DWORD dwParm2) {
   if (pPostAlloc-&gt;dwCallback)
      DriverCallBack(pPortalloc-&gt;dwCallback, HIWORD(pPortalloc-&gt;dwFlags),
                     pPortalloc-&gt;hMidi, msg, dwParam1, dwParam2);
}
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Their version of the function looked
  like this:</p>

<pre><code>void FAR PASCAL midiCallback(NPPORTALLOC pPortAlloc, WORD msg,
                               DWORD dwParam1, DWORD dwParm2) {
   char szBuf[80];

   if (pPostAlloc-&gt;dwCallback) {
      wsprintf(szBuf, "" Dc(hMidi=%X,wMsg=%X)"", pPortalloc-&gt;hMidi, msg);
#ifdef DEBUG
   OutputDebugString(szBuf);
#endif
      DriverCallBack(pPortalloc-&gt;dwCallback, HIWORD(pPortalloc-&gt;dwFlags),
                     pPortalloc-&gt;hMidi, msg, dwParam1, dwParam2);
   }
} 
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Not only is there leftover debug stuff in retail code, but it is
  calling a noninterrupt- safe function
  at hardware interrupt time. If the
  <code>wsprintf</code> function ever gets
  discarded, the system will take a
  segment-not-present fault inside a
  hardware interrupt, which leads to a
  pretty quick death.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now if i'm looking at that code i wouldn't have guessed that a call to the library function <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms647550(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>wsprintf</strong></a> would be a problem. What happens if my driver code needs to make use of the Win32 API?</p>

<p>What is a <strong>segment fault</strong>? i understand the concept of a <strong>page-fault</strong>: the code i need is sitting on a page that has been swapped out to the hard-drive, and will need to get back from the hard drive before code execution can continue. What is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">segment fault</a> when we're inside a device-driver's interrupt?</p>

<p>Is <strong>page-faults</strong> the protected mode equivalent of a <strong>segment-fault</strong>? How does one avoid segment faults? Does Windows ever swap out device driver code? How would i stop ""<em>wsprintf from being discarded</em>""? What would cause wsprintf to be ""discarded""? What is ""discarded""? What is the virtue of discarding? When it something <em>un</em>discarded</p>

<p>Why is calling an API call from inside a driver bad, and how would one work around it?</p>
","Win32 DDK: Is calling API from driver interrupt wrong?","<winapi><segmentation-fault><wdk>","2010-01-06 18:54:27","974","2015453","1","<p>A segmentation fault normally refers to an invalid memory access. In most modern operating systems the mechanism which generates seg-faults is also used to provide the demand paging mechanism. What they tend to do is ""swap"" pages of memory out to disc and mark them as invalid, the next time an instruction accesses that bit of memory the kernel recognises that it isn't <em>really</em> an error and will page in memory.</p>

<p>Windows cannot handle page-faults in certain contexts, one of them being in an interrupt. That is just the way it is designed. For example imagine you get a page fault in the code which reads memory pages data from the disk drive, how could it possible handle such an occurrance? So they define certain limitations on what modes of operation are allowed to page and what are not. If you cause a page fault in an interrupt the kernel will force a BSOD. </p>

<p>What you are supposed to do in an interrupt context if you need to do something which might need paging is to queue what is called a Deferred Procedure Call (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_Procedure_Call"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DPC</a>) in the interrupt handler. The DPC is then executed at DPC level (something you will see mentioned if you read some of the descriptions of DDK functions). DPC level can page and so you can use any function you need. </p>

<p>As for driver stuff, you can mark some of your code as non-pageable and you can allocate non-paged-pool which is memory you can access without causing page-faults. wsprintf could be paged out because no-one has used it and the kernel reclaims the memory.</p>

"2019716","<p>I have a QWebView which displays some HTML content and I used CSS to style the text:</p>

<pre><code>body { font-size: 10pt; }

<p>The window with the QWebView also has a <code>QTextEdit</code> field, for which I have set the font like this:</p>

<pre><code>QFont newFont;
newfont.setPointSize(10);
myEditField-&gt;setFont(newFont);
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, the text displayed in the <code>QWebView</code> is slightly larger than the text displayed in the <code>QTextEdit</code>. I have a feeling that this has something to do with DPI settings being different in the <code>QWebView</code>.</p>

<p>Is there a way to get the same font sizes displayed for both the <code>QWebView</code> and the <code>QTextEdit</code>?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It appears to be true that WebKit assumes 96 dpi as a fixed resolution. If this is how web content is designed then we have a problem changing that, because there are other people that expect WebKit to render web content like in web browsers.
  See also <a href=""https://www.webkit.org/blog/57/css-units/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.webkit.org/blog/57/css-units/</a></p>

<p>They suggested two solutions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>QWebView provides <a href=""https://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qwebview.html#zoomFactor-prop"" rel=""nofollow"">setZoomFactor</a> and <a href=""https://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/qwebview.html#setTextSizeMultiplier"" rel=""nofollow"">setTextMultiplier</a> which I believe could be used to get the desired behaviour (matching the QWidget ).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can calculate zoom factor and text multiplier using current DPI:</p>

<pre><code>QWidget* window = QApplication::desktop()-&gt;screen();
const int horizontalDpi = window-&gt;logicalDpiX(); 
m_view-&gt;setZoomFactor(horizontalDpi / 96.0);
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>QWebSettings::ZoomTextOnly</code> you can apply zooming to the text only.</p>

"2019942","<p>Is it possible to group items in a ItemsControl or Listbox in Silverlight? These controls are bound to a DomainDataSource.</p>

<p>Or are there any 3rd party controls that do this?</p>

<p>This is the sort of UI I am trying to create.</p>

<p>Say I have a datasource - <code>MyItems</code> - with fields: <code>Category</code>, <code>Section</code> and <code>Option</code>. I can create a <code>PagedCollectionView</code> from an <code>IEnumerable(of MyItems)</code> and tell it which fields to group by. </p>

<pre><code>Dim original As IEnumerable(Of MyItems) = GetMyItems()

Dim pcv = New PagedCollectionView(original)

pcv.GroupDescriptions.Add(New PropertyGroupDescription(""Category""))
pcv.GroupDescriptions.Add(New PropertyGroupDescription(""Section""))
</code></pre>

<p>Then I bind my first <code>ItemsControl</code> to the <code>PagedCollectionView</code></p>

<pre><code>hisMyItems.ItemsSource = pcv.Groups
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>PCV</code> creates a nested hierachy like:</p>

<pre><code>-Name
    -Items
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>Name</code> is the value in the grouped field and <code>Items</code> contains the rows/objects in that grouping. I guess you could also create the PCV in xaml if you prefer.</p>

<p>The xaml would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;controls:HeaderedItemsControl x:Name=""hisMyItems"" Header=""{Binding Name}"" ItemsSource=""{Binding Items}"" &gt;
    &lt;controls:HeaderedItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;

            &lt;controls:HeaderedItemsControl Header=""{Binding Name}"" ItemsSource=""{Binding Items}"" ItemsPanel=""{StaticResource ItemsPanelTemplate1}"" &gt;
                &lt;controls:HeaderedItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
                    &lt;DataTemplate&gt;

                &lt;/controls:HeaderedItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
            &lt;/controls:HeaderedItemsControl&gt;

        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/controls:HeaderedItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
&lt;/controls:HeaderedItemsControl&gt;

"2020499","<p>At the moment, i got quite badly fashioned view model.</p>

<p>Classes looks like this=></p>

<pre><code> public class AccountActionsForm
    {
        public Reader Reader { get; set; }
        //something...
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Problem is that Reader type comes from domain model (violation of SRP).</p>

<p>Basically, i'm looking for design tips (i.e. is it a good idea to split view model to inputs/outputs?) how to make my view model friction-less and developer friendly (i.e. - mapping should work automatically using controller base class)?</p>

<p>I'm aware of AutoMapper framework and i'm likely going to use it.</p>

<p>So, once more - what are common gotchas when trying to create proper view model? How to structure it? How mapping is done when there's a multiple domain object input necessary?</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm confused about cases when view needs data from more than 1 aggregate root. I'm creating app which has entities like Library, Reader, BibliographicRecord etc.</p>

<p>In my case - at domain level, it makes no sense to group all those 3 types into <code>LibraryReaderThatHasOrderedSomeBooks</code> or whatnot, but view that should display list about ordered books for specific reader in specific library needs them all.</p>

<p>So - it seems fine to create view <code>OrderedBooksList</code> with <code>OrderedBooksListModel</code> view model underneath that holds <code>LibraryOutput</code>, <code>ReaderOutput</code> and <code>BibliographicRecordOutput</code> view models. Or even better - <code>OrderedBooksListModel</code> view model, that leverages <a href=""http://automapper.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Flattening&amp;referringTitle=Home"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">flattening technique</a> and has props like <code>ReaderFirstName</code>, <code>LibraryName</code> etc.</p>

<p>But that leads to mapping problems because there are more than one input.<br>
It's not 1:1 relation anymore where i kick in one aggregate root only.<br>
Does that mean my domain model is kind a wrong?</p>

<p>And what about view model fields that live purely on UI layer (i.e. enum that indicates checked tab)?</p>

<p>Is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/944334/asp-net-mvc-view-with-multiple-models/944371#944371"">this</a> what everyone does in such a cases?</p>

<pre><code> FooBarViewData fbvd = new FooBarViewData();
   fbvd.Foo = new Foo(){ A = ""aaa""};
   fbvd.Bar = new Bar(){ B = ""bbb""};
   return View(fbvd);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not willing to do this=></p>

<pre><code>var fbvd = new FooBarViewData();
   fbvd.FooOutput =  _mapper.Map&lt;Foo,FooOutput&gt;(new Foo(){ A = ""aaa""});
   fbvd.BarOutput = _mapper.Map&lt;Bar,BarOutput&gt;(new Bar(){ B = ""bbb""});
   return View(fbvd);
</code></pre>

<p>Seems like a lot of writing. :)</p>

","How to handle view model with multiple aggregate roots?","<asp.net-mvc><viewmodel><automapper>","2010-01-07 13:16:43","3322","2042167","3","<p>It's tough to define all these, but here goes.  We like to separate out what we call what the View sees from what the Controller builds.  The View sees a flattened, brain-dead DTO-like object.  We call this a View Model.</p>

<p>On the Controller side, we build up a rich graph of what's needed to build the View Model.  This could be just a single aggregate root, or it could be a composition of several aggregate roots.  All of these together combine into what we call the Presentation Model.  Sometimes the Presentation Model is just our Persistence (Domain) Model, but sometimes it's a new object altogether.  However, what we've found in practice is that if we need to build a composite Presentation Model, it tends to become a magnet for related behavior.</p>

<p>In your example, I'd create a ViewFooBarModel, and a ViewFooBarViewModel (or ViewFooBarModelDto).  I can then talk about ViewFooBarModel in my controller, and then rely on mapping to flatten out what I need from this intermediate model with AutoMapper.</p>

<p>So in this image there is a diagram of the function, which is defined on the given points.
For example on points x=1..N.</p>

<p>Another diagram, which was drawn as a semitransparent curve, 
That is what I want to get from the original diagram, 
i.e. I want to approximate the original function so that it becomes smooth.</p>

<p>Are there any methods for doing that?</p>

<p>I heard about least squares method, which can be used to approximate a function by straight line or by parabolic function. But I do not need to approximate by parabolic function. 
I probably need to approximate it by trigonometric function.
So are there any methods for doing that?
And one idea, is it possible to use the Least squares method for this problem, if we can deduce it for trigonometric functions?</p>

<p>One more question!
If I use the discrete Fourier transform and think about the function as a sum of waves, so may be noise has special features by which we can define it and then we can set to zero the corresponding frequency and then perform inverse Fourier transform.
So if you think that it is possible, then what can you suggest in order to identify the frequency of noise?</p>
","approximation methods","<math><approximation>","2010-01-07 14:39:23","1788","2029978","5","<p>Unfortunately many solutions here presented don't solve the problem and/or they are plain wrong.
There are many approaches and they are specifically built to solve conditions and requirements you must be aware of !</p>

<p>a) Approximation theory: If you have a very sharp defined function without errors (given by either definition or data) and you want to trace it exactly as possible, you are using
polynominal or rational approximation by Chebyshev or Legendre polynoms, meaning that you
approach the function by a polynom or, if periodical, by Fourier series.</p>

<p>b) Interpolation: If you have a function where some points (but not the whole curve!) are given and you need a function to get through this points, you can use several methods:</p>

<p>Newton-Gregory, Newton with divided differences, Lagrange, Hermite, Spline</p>

<p>c) Curve fitting: You have a function with given points and you want to draw a curve with a given (!) function which approximates the curve as closely as possible. There are linear
and nonlinear algorithms for this case.</p>

<p><em>Your</em> drawing implicates:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is not remotely like a mathematical function.</li>
<li>It is not sharply defined by data or function</li>
<li>You need to fit the curve, not some points. </li>
</ul>

<p>What do you want and need is</p>

<p>d) Smoothing: Given a curve or datapoints with noise or rapidly changing elements, you only want to see the slow changes over time.</p>

<p>You can do that with LOESS as Jacob suggested (but I find that overkill, especially because
choosing a reasonable span needs some experience). For your problem, I simply recommend
the running average as suggested by Jim C.</p>

<p>Sorry, cdonner and Orendorff, your proposals are well-minded, but completely wrong because you are using the right tools for the wrong solution. </p>

"2028958","<p>I need to create a rich:dataTable (or even extended) with the following features:</p>

<p>I have a class Company having a collection of Product objects. I want to show the following table:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/kpCsu.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I still have not figured out how to do this with a subtable (in all the examples I found the subTable has the exact same columns as the master table). Presumably, I need to play with rowspans in the first two columns, but I still have not found the way.</p>

<p>Could someone provide a pseudo-code for this?</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong>
I tried set the <strong>rowspan</strong> of the columns in the left as the size of the list or products, and then :</p>

<ul>
<li>if the products is empty (no products for the company yet), I print two columns. I do this conditionally by setting their <strong>rendered</strong> attribute to <strong>#{myFuncs:sizeOf(company.products)}</strong></li>
<li>If the products are >= 1 then I iterate over them with <strong></strong> and inside that loop I insert two columns (one for product name and one for description), and for each product name column except the first one I set the <strong>breakBefore</strong> attribute to <strong>#{ !myFunc:firstProduct(company.products, product)}</strong>, which evaluates to true for all product names except the first one.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, this did not work for me, because the columns inside the <strong>a4j:repeat</strong> do not appear at all - not because of the <strong>rendered</strong> tag. The loop is correct because if I print standard text else, it appears.</p>

<p>Is there a way to achieve rowspan, or am I banging my head on the wall?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong>
The issue is probably related to this <a href=""http://blog.hibernate.org/11633.lace"" rel=""noreferrer"">article</a>, indicating the differences between iteration components such as <strong>&lt; a4j:repeat></strong> and the tag <strong>&lt; c:forEach></strong>. The first takes place at rendering time, while the second one operates earlier, when JSF components are placed onto the component tree of the page.</p>

<p>I tried to get the rich:columns outside the a4j:repeat and they get rendered (of course, not as expected, but they do).</p>

<p>It looks like there is no leak. My theory is that the request at 3:20 caused the young generation to fill up, and the resulting minor GC promoted some objects to older generation. The next major GC, caused by the request at 4:40 cleaned most of those up.</p>

<p>You can verify this by using a profiler to mark the heap before issuing the same request as the one at 3:20, forcing a full GC, and then checking what objects are lingering. I am not sure if VisualVM lets you (1) mark the heap and (2) force a full GC, but OptimizeIt used to do it.</p>

","Is using subviews in Alert undocumented","<objective-c><iphone>","2010-01-09 05:56:57","2122","2034076","3","<p>To follow on Henrik's reply, in the iPhone Human Interface Guidelines section <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/ModalViews/ModalViews.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH11-SW8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Designing an Alert""</a>, they say the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Although you can choose the number of
  buttons to place in an alert, a
  two-button alert is often the most
  useful, because it is easiest for
  users to choose between two
  alternatives. It is rarely a good idea
  to display an alert with a single
  button because such an alert cannot
  give users any control over the
  situation; instead, it can only
  display information and provide a
  dismiss button. <strong>An alert that contains
  three or more buttons is significantly
  more complex than a two-button alert,
  and should be avoided if possible.</strong> In
  fact, if you find that you need to
  offer users more than two choices, you
  should consider using an action sheet
  instead (see “Using Action Sheets” and
  “Designing an Action Sheet” for more
  information on this type of view).</p>
  
  <p><strong>Because users sometimes respond to
  alerts without reading them carefully,
  be sure to provide an appropriate
  default choice. To help guide
  inattentive users towards this choice,
  make the light-colored, right-hand
  button the safe, default alternative.</strong>
  For example, you might choose to make
  this button the Cancel button, to help
  users avoid inadvertently causing a
  dangerous action, or you might make it
  represent the most common response, if
  the resulting action isn’t
  destructive.</p>
  
  <p>The following guidelines describe how
  buttons are configured in an alert:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>In an alert with two buttons, the button on the left is always
  dark-colored and the button on the
  right is never dark-colored.</p></li>
  <li><p>In a two-button alert that proposes a potentially risky action, the button
  that cancels the action should be on
  the right and light-colored.</p></li>
  <li><p>In a two-button alert that proposes a benign action, the button that
  cancels the action should be on the
  left (and therefore dark-colored).</p></li>
  <li>In an alert with a single button, the button is light-colored.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>You are clearly violating the guidelines in size, shape, number, and color of the buttons in your alert view (red has a very clear meaning as a destructive action, not a confirmation).  Even if Apple doesn't reject your application in review (which they tend to do for clear violations of the Human Interface Guidelines), this would be extremely confusing to your users.</p>

<p>Also, navigating the hidden view hierarchy for any Apple-supplied user interface element is a very bad practice.  The view hierarchies are undocumented, and do change often.  Many of the applications that started crashing when people upgraded to iPhone OS 3.0 did so because those applications did something funky with subviews of UI elements, and those elements changed in the new OS version.  Apple even specifically called this out in the iPhone OS 3.0 migration documents (which I can't find now).  </p>

<p>Because of the problems this caused, they appear to have cracked down on this practice and have been rejecting applications because of it.  Even if they don't, it shows contempt for your users if you do this, because it means that you don't care if your application breaks with future OS upgrade.</p>

"2034037","<p>I am trying to emboss an image using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_Imaging_Library"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PIL</a>. </p>

<p>PIL provides a basic way to emboss an image ( using <code>ImageFilter.EMBOSS</code>).  </p>

<p>In image editing packages like GIMP, you can vary parameters like Azimuth, depth and elevation in this embossed image. </p>

<p>How to do this with PIL? At the very least I want to adjust the ""depth"" of the embossed image.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I tried things suggested by Paul (modifying the <code>filterargs</code>such as <code>scale, offset</code> and the matrix), but I couldn't change the ""depth"" effect. So still looking for an answer. </p>

<p>Here is the comparison of embossing effect using PIL (left) and GIMP (right).

<p>Within ImageFilter.py you will find this class:</p>

<pre><code>##
# Embossing filter.

class EMBOSS(BuiltinFilter):
    name = ""Emboss""
    filterargs = (3, 3), 1, 128, (
        -1,  0,  0,
        0,  1,  0,
        0,  0,  0
        )
</code></pre>

<p>Placing a -1 in a different corner of the matrix will change the azimuth and making it a -2 <em>may</em> have the effect you are looking for.</p>

<p>The matrix is applied pixel-by-pixel.  Each element in the matrix corresponds to the current pixel and surrounding pixels; the center value representing the current pixel.  The new, transformed current pixel will be created as a combination of all 9 pixels, weighted by the values in the matrix.  For example, a matrix with all zeros and a 1 in the center will not change the image.  </p>

<p>Additional parameters are <code>scale</code> and <code>offset</code>.  For the built-in EMBOSS, the values are 1 (scale) and 128 (offset).  Changing these will change the overall strength of the result.</p>

<p>From ImageFilter.py:</p>

<pre><code># @keyparam scale Scale factor.  If given, the result for each
#    pixel is divided by this value.  The default is the sum
#    of the kernel weights.
# @keyparam offset Offset.  If given, this value is added to the
#    result, after it has been divided by the scale factor.
</code></pre>

<p>As I am unfamiliar with the effects of GIMP's ""depth"" parameter, I cannot say which is most likely to do what you want.</p>

<p>You can also make the matrix a different size.  Replace the (3,3) with (5,5), and then create 25-element matrix.</p>

<p>To make temporary changes to the filter without re-saving source code, just do this:</p>

<pre><code>ImageFilter.EMBOSS.filterargs=((3, 3), 1, 128, (-1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0))
</code></pre>

<h2>Edit: (taking the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NumPy</a> approach)</h2>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/ZcNTR.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ZcNTR.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reading the RTF file as plain text I find that the control tags related to image size is <code>\picscalex100</code> and <code>\picscaley100</code> (where 100 denotes scaled to 100%).</li>
</ul>

<p>So yeah, is there a proper way or trick to this? Any advice on how to go about programming it? Or am I looking at the wrong control altogether?</p>

<p>Is there any way I can set in the Labels' styles so that their text bottoms should be aligned?<br>
I have the same question with TextBlocks as well.  </p>

<p>NOTE: since I've been struggling with this issue for a while, please post only certains answers that you know that work.<br>
I already tried: VerticalAlignment, VerticalContentAlignment, Padding, Margin. Is there anything else I am not aware of?</p>

<p>I've read <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1099754/vertically-aligning-labels-and-textblocks-at-top-in-xaml"">this</a> post, but it doesn't talk about a scenario of different font size.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: The problem is, that even Padding is set to 0 there is still an indeterminate space around the font, within the ContentPresenter area. this space varies on the font size.
If I could control this space I would be in a better situation.</p>

","Align bottoms of text in controls","<wpf><layout><textblock>","2010-01-10 03:09:20","12345","2037163","7","<p>There is no XAML only solution, you have to use code behind. Also, even with code-behind, there's no general solution for this, because what if your text is multi-line? Which baseline should be used in that case? Or what if there are multiple text elements in your template? Such as a header and a content, or more, which baseline then?</p>

<p>In short, your best bet is to align the text manually using top/bottom margins.</p>

<p>If you're willing to make the assumption that you have a single text element, you can figure out the pixel distance of the baseline from the top of the element by instantiating a <code>FormattedText</code> object with all the same properties of the existing text element. The <code>FormattedText</code> object has a <code>double</code> <code>Baseline</code> property which holds that value. Note that you still would have to manually enter a margin, because the element might not sit exactly against the top or bottom of its container.</p>

<p>See this MSDN forum post: <a href=""http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/wpf/thread/283fd759-a884-4c78-b508-89c68e0c8570"" rel=""noreferrer"">Textbox Baseline</a></p>

<p>Here's a method I wrote that extracts that value. It uses reflection to get the relevant properties because they are not common to any single base class (they are defined separately on <code>Control</code>, <code>TextBlock</code>, <code>Page</code>, <code>TextElement</code> and maybe others).</p>

<pre><code>public double CalculateBaseline(object textObject)
{
    double r = double.NaN;
    if (textObject == null) return r;

    Type t = textObject.GetType();
    BindingFlags bindingFlags = BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public;

    var fontSizeFI = t.GetProperty(""FontSize"", bindingFlags);
    if (fontSizeFI == null) return r;
    var fontFamilyFI = t.GetProperty(""FontFamily"", bindingFlags);
    var fontStyleFI = t.GetProperty(""FontStyle"", bindingFlags);
    var fontWeightFI = t.GetProperty(""FontWeight"", bindingFlags);
    var fontStretchFI = t.GetProperty(""FontStretch"", bindingFlags);

    var fontSize = (double)fontSizeFI.GetValue(textObject, null);
    var fontFamily = (FontFamily)fontFamilyFI.GetValue(textObject, null);
    var fontStyle = (FontStyle)fontStyleFI.GetValue(textObject, null);
    var fontWeight = (FontWeight)fontWeightFI.GetValue(textObject, null);
    var fontStretch = (FontStretch)fontStretchFI.GetValue(textObject, null);

    var typeFace = new Typeface(fontFamily, fontStyle, fontWeight, fontStretch);

    var formattedText = new FormattedText(
        ""W"", 
        CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, 
        FlowDirection.LeftToRight, 
        typeFace, 
        fontSize, 
        Brushes.Black);

    r = formattedText.Baseline;

    return r;
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Shimmy, in response to your comment, I don't believe you've actually tried this solution, because it works. Here's an example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/lyKjk.jpg"" alt=""Example Baseline Alignment""></p>

<p>Here's the XAML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;StackPanel&gt;
    &lt;StackPanel.Resources&gt;
        &lt;Style TargetType=""TextBlock""&gt;
            &lt;Setter Property=""Margin"" Value=""0,40,0,0""/&gt;
        &lt;/Style&gt;
    &lt;/StackPanel.Resources&gt;
    &lt;StackPanel Orientation=""Horizontal""&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock Name=""tb1"" Text=""Lorem "" FontSize=""10""/&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock Name=""tbref"" Text=""ipsum""/&gt;
    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
    &lt;StackPanel Orientation=""Horizontal""&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock Name=""tb2"" Text=""dolor ""  FontSize=""20""/&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock Text=""sit""/&gt;
    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
    &lt;StackPanel Orientation=""Horizontal""&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock Name=""tb3"" Text=""amet ""  FontSize=""30""/&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock Text=""consectetuer""/&gt;
    &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
&lt;/StackPanel&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the code behind that achieves this</p>

<pre><code>double baseRef = CalculateBaseline(tbref);
double base1 = CalculateBaseline(tb1) - baseRef;
double base2 = CalculateBaseline(tb2) - baseRef;
double base3 = CalculateBaseline(tb3) - baseRef;
tb1.Margin = new Thickness(0, 40 - base1, 0, 0);
tb2.Margin = new Thickness(0, 40 - base2, 0, 0);
tb3.Margin = new Thickness(0, 40 - base3, 0, 0);

"2044444","<p>I have a repeater that currently displays a list of counties and townships within those counties. The county records and township records are treated the same in the repeator, aside from having different RowFormat attributes. Each record also has a unique id and the unit (whether it be a township or county) name to display. There is also a column for townships to reference their parent counties. I utilize the AlternatingItemTemplate option on the repeator to display alternating colors on each township. </p>

<p>I want to be able to display and hide the township rows when the '+' or '-' images are clicked on each row. To add this image to only the county rows I've added an additional column to the bound DataTable which is either empty (for the townships) or contains a tablecell containing the '+' image:</p>

<pre><code>row[""Image""] = ""&lt;img src='/includes/plus.gif' /&gt;"";

I also need to switch the countiy's Image field to display the opposite image (i.e. from '+' -> '-' and vise versa).</p>

<p>I thought about potentially using a repeater for each county inside a datagrid to iterate each county's townships, but as of now I'm storing every record in the same datatable, and therefore would have to separate out the counties and towniships into multiple tables. Can anyone suggest a way to better approach this? I'm relatively new to ASP.NET, so I'm not aware of all of the options available to me.</p>

"2044752","<p>This is a SQL design question. First, the setup. I have three tables:</p>

<ol>
<li>A, which is automatically populated based on a query against a linked server. The data in this table cannot be changed;</li>
<li>B, which has just a dozen or so rows, containing the names for collections of As;</li>
<li>AtoB, which is the mapping table by which As are organized into named collections, with foreign keys on both columns;</li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/XQ46g.png"" alt=""SQL Mapping Table""></p>

<p>For example, A contains:</p>

<ol>
<li>Giraffe </li>
<li>Owl</li>
<li>Tiger</li>
</ol>

<p>And B contains:</p>

<ol>
<li>Seattle Zoo </li>
<li>San Jose Zoo</li>
</ol>

<p>And AtoB contains:</p>

<p>1,1 (Giraffe in Seattle)<br>
 2,1 (Owl in Seattle)<br>
 3,1 (Tiger in Seattle)<br>
 2,2 (Owl in San Jose)  </p>

<p>Now, the problem: </p>

<p>I've been asked to include in some of these collections items not found in A. So, I create a table, C, with the same identity and Name columns as A, and populate it. In keeping with the earlier example, let's say C contains:</p>

<ol>
<li>Dragon</li>
</ol>

<p>The question is, how do I include items from C in AtoB? What if I need to include a Dragon in the Seattle Zoo? </p>

<p>My first instinct, being naive, was to create a view V containing the union of A and C, and modifying AtoB to be VtoB. That's where my naivety paid off: one cannot create a foreign key to a view. </p>

<p>I suspect that there's a standard, correct means of relating one or more A OR C with a B. </p>

    WHERE AtoB.A_ID = A.ID &amp;&amp; B.ID = AtoB.B_ID 
UNION
SELECT C.Name as Animal, B.Name as Zoo FROM C, CtoB, B
    WHERE CtoB.C_ID = C.ID &amp;&amp; B.ID = CtoB.B_ID

<p>Then, you can perform a query like:</p>

"2049196","<p>I'm trying to come up with an iterative function that generates xyz coordinates for a hexagonal grid. With a starting hex position (say 0,0,0 for simplicity), I want to calculate the coordinates for each successive ""ring"" of hexagons, as illustrated here: </p>

    var tpRing = i*6;
    var tpVect = tpRing/3;
    // for each vector of ring
    for (var j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {
        // for each tile in vector
        for(var k = 0; k &lt; tpVect; k++) {
            xyz[0] = ???;
            xyz[1] = ???;
            xyz[2] = ???;
            console.log(xyz);
        }
    }
}

<p>I know each ring contains six more points than the previous and each 120&deg; vector contains one additional point for each step from the center. I also know that <code>x + y + z = 0</code> for all tiles. But how can I generate a list of coordinates that follow the sequence below? </p>

<h2>Edit:</h2>

<p><strong>Answers review</strong><br>
<em>John at CashCommons</em> and <em>Wayne Conrad</em> comment that my current approach is good and fast enough. Let me use a silly analogy: If you were given the task of counting the squares in a chess board in less than 1 minute, you could finish the task by counting the squares one by one, but a <em>better</em> solution is to count the sides and do a multiplication, because you later may be asked to count the tiles in a building.<br>
<em>Alex Reisner</em> points to a very interesting mathematical law that, unfortunately, doesn’t seem to be relevant to this problem.<br>
<em>Andres</em> suggests the same algorithm I’m using, but extracting digits with %10 operations instead of substrings.<br>
<em>John at CashCommons</em> and <em>phord</em> propose pre-calculating the digits required and storing them in a lookup table or, for raw speed, an array. This could be a good solution if we had an absolute, unmovable, set in stone, maximum integer value. I’ve never seen one of those.<br>
<em>High-Performance Mark</em>  and <em>strainer</em> computed the needed digits for various ranges. The result for one millon seems to indicate there is a proportion, but the results for other number show different proportions.<br>
<em>strainer</em> found some formulas that may be used to count digit for number which are a power of ten.
<em>Robert Harvey</em> had a very interesting experience posting the question at MathOverflow. One of the math guys wrote a solution using mathematical notation.<br>
<em>Aaronaught</em> developed and tested a solution using mathematics. After posting it he reviewed the formulas originated from Math Overflow and found a flaw in it (point to Stackoverflow :).<br>
<em>noahlavine</em> developed an algorithm and presented it in pseudocode.  </p>

<p><strong>A new solution</strong><br>
After reading all the answers, and doing some experiments, I found that for a range of integer from 1 to 10<sup>n</sup>-1:  </p>

<ul>
<li>For digits 1 to 9, n*10<sup>(n-1)</sup> pieces are needed </li>
<li>For digit 0, if not using leading zeros, n*10<sup>n-1</sup> - ((10<sup>n</sup>-1) / 9) are needed</li>
<li>For digit 0, if using leading zeros,  n*10<sup>n-1</sup> - n are needed</li>
</ul>

<p>The first formula was found by <em>strainer</em> (and probably by others), and I found the other two by trial and error (but they may be included in other answers).</p>

<p>For example, if n = 6, range is 1 to 999,999:</p>

<ul>
<li>For digits 1 to 9 we need 6*10<sup>5</sup> = 600,000 of each one</li>
<li>For digit 0, without leading zeros, we need 6*10<sup>5</sup> – (10<sup>6</sup>-1)/9 = 600,000 - 111,111 = 488,889</li>
<li>For digit 0, with leading zeros, we need 6*10<sup>5</sup> – 6 = 599,994</li>
</ul>

<p>These numbers can be checked using <em>High-Performance Mark</em> results. </p>

<p>Using these formulas, I improved the original algorithm. It still loops from the first to the last number in the range of integers, but, if it finds a number which is a power of ten, it uses the formulas to add to the digits count the quantity for a full range of 1 to 9 or 1 to 99 or 1 to 999 etc. Here's the algorithm in pseudocode:</p>

<pre>integer First,Last //First and last number in the range
integer Number     //Current number in the loop
integer Power      //Power is the n in 10^n in the formulas
integer Nines      //Nines is the resut of 10^n - 1, 10^5 - 1 = 99999
integer Prefix     //First digits in a number. For 14,200, prefix is 142
array 0..9  Digits //Will hold the count for all the digits

FOR Number = First TO Last
  CALL TallyDigitsForOneNumber WITH Number,1  //Tally the count of each digit 
                                              //in the number, increment by 1
  //Start of optimization. Comments are for Number = 1,000 and Last = 8,000.
  Power = Zeros at the end of number //For 1,000, Power = 3
  IF Power > 0                       //The number ends in 0 00 000 etc 
    Nines = 10^Power-1                 //Nines = 10^3 - 1 = 1000 - 1 = 999
    IF Number+Nines &lt;= Last            //If 1,000+999 &lt; 8,000, add a full set
      Digits[0-9] += Power*10^(Power-1)  //Add 3*10^(3-1) = 300 to digits 0 to 9
      Digits[0]   -= -Power              //Adjust digit 0 (leading zeros formula)
      Prefix = First digits of Number    //For 1000, prefix is 1
      CALL TallyDigitsForOneNumber WITH Prefix,Nines //Tally the count of each 
                                                     //digit in prefix,
                                                     //increment by 999
      Number += Nines                    //Increment the loop counter 999 cycles

<p>Note that this algorithm solves the problem without leading zeros. To use it with leading zeros, I used a hack:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If range 700 to 1,000 with leading zeros is needed, use the algorithm for 10,700 to 11,000 and then substract 1,000 - 700 = 300 from the count of digit 1.</p>

You can see that the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> containing the list overlaps the image for some reason.</p>

<p>Note: if the unordered list isn't in that div, then this works as expected. It's like the presence of bullets push it over further to the left.</p>

<p>Also note: this still doesn't work if I wrap the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> in it's own div.</p>

<p>The key things I'm doing here are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Removing the img element and applying it as a background image of .statsbox instead. This actually gives you lots of flexibility about where the image goes, without it impacting on the other elements in the html.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoiding using list-style-postition: inside - using this property means the bullets are basically rendered as a part of the text line they are on; if the lines happen to wrap for any reason, the bullets will fail to line up properly.</p></li>
<li><p>Made <code>&lt;p class=""statsbox_header""&gt; User Uploaded Images &lt;/p&gt;</code> an h3 instead. You've indicated that it's a heading so you might as well use that element, as it leads to cleaner markup/css.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed the class ""statsbox"" from the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements as CSS inheritance means you should be able to style these just by using a selector such as <code>.statsbox li</code> or similar. Which again makes your markup and styles simpler.</p></li>

"2064493","<p>Say you're writing a web page for fruit vendors using Spring MVC's <a href=""http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.6/api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/SimpleFormController.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SimpleFormController</a>, version 2.5.6. On this page the vendor can do simple things like change their name or their address. They can also change their inventory based on a drop down list filled with present inventory selections.</p>

<p>When this drop down list selection changes, the entire form changes to match the inventory of what has been selected. So one stock selection may have bananas and pears, another may have melons, blueberries and grapefruit. 
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/22v77.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/22v77.png"" alt=""Image to demonstrate what I am talking about.""></a>
</p>

<p>Inside each inventory selection is a input field that needs to be propagated back to the database, for the sake of this example let's say that the user enters the number of fruit.</p>

<p>The way this is modeled in the database is that each Stock name is stored in a table, which has a one to many relationship with the contents of each stock, which would be the type of fruit in this example. Then the type of fruit has a one to many relationship with the quantity the vendor selects. Stock name and the type of fruit in each stock are stored in the database and are unchangeable by the user, with the connected fruit quantity table being editable.</p>

<p>My question is, <strong>how do you model the form described above in Spring MVC?</strong>  </p>

<p>I've tried overriding the <a href=""http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.6/api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/SimpleFormController.html#isFormChangeRequest%28javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">isFormChangeRequest</a> and <a href=""http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.6/api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/SimpleFormController.html#onFormChange%28javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest,%20javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse,%20java.lang.Object,%20org.springframework.validation.BindException%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">onFormChange</a> to facilitate the form change, but I think I may be misunderstanding the intent of these methods.

<p>That's a huge difference. What's wrong this strange result? What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
I wrote a monitor script last night. It records the memory usage and number of on-line users. It is a radio server, so you can see there is radios and total listeners. Here is the figure I generated by matplotlib.

<p>Something is strange. Sometimes the memory usage printed by ps is very low, like this</p>

<p>What is the reason of the super low value of memory usage? And what's more, even there is no on-line radios, no listeners, the memory usage is still high.</p>

<p>it can be a bit confusing, 4 different size metrics can be seen with:</p>

<p>the virtual size includes memory that was reserved by the process and not used, the size of all shared libraries that were loaded, pages that are swapped out, and blocks that were already freed by your process, so it could be much larger than the size of all live objects in python.</p>

            &lt;/dataFormToolkit:DataForm.EditTemplate&gt;

<p>To make the second DataForm work, I simply created a Person class, and put the following in <b>Home.xaml.cs</b>:</p>

<p><pre><code>

{
    Person client = new Person { Age = 10, DateOfBirth = new DateTime(1980, 10, 20), FirstName = ""John"", LastName = ""Doe"" };

"2067501","<p>I have a legacy PHP form that I'm moving over to Drupal 6. I'm trying to make things easy for me as well as the future admins of the site. The below form is the heart of the old site data. So far in cck I have Locations, in taxonomy I have Countries, now I just need to allow these Species data to be added. I would do it in CCK, but I also want to be able to add N number of Species to each form with all 12 Quadrats of % Cover and Density. (For each species in that location there is % Cover, Density, Flower, Fruit, etc ie alot of data!)</p>

<p>Basically my question is, can this form be accomplished in 1) CCK where the whole form can be filled out on one page, 2) by creating a custom CCK field to enter in a Species (using FormAPI) or 3) bite the bullet and write a custom module with FormAPI fields and keep track of the data in tables myself?</p>

<p>If I'm reading you correctly, you're creating some kind of Botanical Entry type. I gather that Location is set up as a separate type, and that field could be a node reference in BE. (Or perhaps it's just a list in an text field with a drop down widget.) Same thing with Transect and Station. Researchers could be a user reference field.</p>

<p>Then you want to add your species data (the second form). I don't really know what all those fields are for, but I'll bet that interface could be simplified. Species might be a separate CCK type, which you'd connect via node reference, or you could create a custom CCK field type. Either way, you could allow adding more than one of those to a node to get the mulitple entries.

<p>As for your data, rectangles you are trying to find are the only black objects. So you can try to do a threshold binarization: black pixels are those ones which have ALL three RGB values less than 40 (I've found it empirically). This simple operation makes your picture look like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/hbqPU.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/hbqPU.png"" alt=""binarized picture""></a>
</p>

<p>After that you could apply Hough transform to find lines (discussed in the topic I referred to), or you can do it easier. Compute integral projections of the black pixels to X and Y axes. (The projection to X is a vector of x_i - numbers of black pixels such that it has the first coordinate equal to x_i). So, you get possible x and y values as the peaks of the projections. Then look through all the possible segments restricted by the found x and y (if there are a lot of black pixels between (x_i, y_j) and (x_i, y_k), there probably is a line probably). Finally, compose line segments to rectangles!</p>

"2068134","<p>I'm making a software rasterizer, and I've run into a bit of a snag: I can't seem to get perspective-correct texture mapping to work.</p>

<p>My algorithm is to first sort the coordinates to plot by <code>y</code>. This returns a highest, lowest and center point. I then walk across the scanlines using the delta's:</p>

<pre><code>// ordering by y is put here

order[0] = &amp;a_Triangle.p[v_order[0]];
order[1] = &amp;a_Triangle.p[v_order[1]];
order[2] = &amp;a_Triangle.p[v_order[2]];

float height1, height2, height3;

height1 = (float)((int)(order[2]-&gt;y + 1) - (int)(order[0]-&gt;y));
height2 = (float)((int)(order[1]-&gt;y + 1) - (int)(order[0]-&gt;y));
height3 = (float)((int)(order[2]-&gt;y + 1) - (int)(order[1]-&gt;y));

// x 

float x_start, x_end;
float x[3];
float x_delta[3];

x_delta[0] = (order[2]-&gt;x - order[0]-&gt;x) / height1;
x_delta[1] = (order[1]-&gt;x - order[0]-&gt;x) / height2;
x_delta[2] = (order[2]-&gt;x - order[1]-&gt;x) / height3;

x[0] = order[0]-&gt;x;
x[1] = order[0]-&gt;x;
x[2] = order[1]-&gt;x;
</code></pre>

<p>And then we render from <code>order[0]-&gt;y</code> to <code>order[2]-&gt;y</code>, increasing the <code>x_start</code> and <code>x_end</code> by a delta. When rendering the top part, the delta's are <code>x_delta[0]</code> and <code>x_delta[1]</code>. When rendering the bottom part, the delta's are <code>x_delta[0]</code> and <code>x_delta[2]</code>. Then we linearly interpolate between x_start and x_end on our scanline. UV coordinates are interpolated in the same way, ordered by y, starting at begin and end, to which delta's are applied each step.</p>

<p>This works fine except when I try to do perspective correct UV mapping. The basic algorithm is to take <code>UV/z</code> and <code>1/z</code> for each vertex and interpolate between them. For each pixel, the UV coordinate becomes <code>UV_current * z_current</code>. However, this is the result:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/5ZBUG.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The inversed part tells you where the delta's are flipped. As you can see, the two triangles both seem to be going towards different points in the horizon.</p>

<p>Here's what I use to calculate the Z at a point in space:</p>

<pre><code>float GetZToPoint(Vec3 a_Point)
{
    Vec3 projected = m_Rotation * (a_Point - m_Position);

    // #define FOV_ANGLE 60.f
    // static const float FOCAL_LENGTH = 1 / tanf(_RadToDeg(FOV_ANGLE) / 2);
    // static const float DEPTH = HALFHEIGHT * FOCAL_LENGTH; 
    float zcamera = DEPTH / projected.z;

    return zcamera;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Am I right, is it a z buffer issue?</p>
","Perspective correct texture mapping; z distance calculation might be wrong","<c++><rasterizing><zbuffer>","2010-01-14 22:51:59","5844","2085510","3","<p>ZBuffer has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>THe ZBuffer is only useful when triangles are overlapping and you want to make sure that they are drawn correctly (e.g. correctly ordered in the Z). The ZBuffer will, for every pixel of the triangle, determine if a previously placed pixel is nearer to the camera, and if so, not draw the pixel of your triangle.</p>

<p>Since you are drawing 2 triangles which don't overlap, this can not be the issue.</p>

<p>I've made a software rasterizer in fixed point once (for a mobile phone), but I don't have the sources on my laptop. So let me check tonight, how I did it. In essence what you've got is not bad! A thing like this could be caused by a very small error</p>

<p>General tips in debugging this is to have a few test triangles (slope left-side, slope right-side, 90 degree angles, etc etc) and step through it with the debugger and see how your logic deals with the cases.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>peudocode of my rasterizer (only U, V and Z are taken into account...  if you also want to do gouraud you also have to do everything for R G and B similar as to what you are doing for U and V and Z:</p>

<p>The idea is that a triangle can be broken down in 2 parts. The top part and the bottom part. The top is from y[0] to y[1]   and the bottom part is from y[1] to y[2]. For both sets you need to calculate the step variables with which you are interpolating. The below example shows you how to do the top part. If needed I can supply the bottom part too.</p>

<p>Please note that I do already calculate the needed interpolation offsets for the bottom part in the below 'pseudocode' fragment</p>

<ul>
<li>first order the coords(x,y,z,u,v) in the order so that coord[0].y &lt; coord[1].y &lt; coord[2].y</li>
<li>next check if any 2 sets of coordinates are identical (only check x and y). If so don't draw</li>
<li>exception: does the triangle have a flat top? if so, the first slope will be infinite</li>
<li>exception2: does the triangle have a flat bottom (yes triangles can have these too ;^)  ) then the last slope too will be infinite</li>
<li>calculate 2 slopes (left side and right side)<br>
leftDeltaX = (x[1] - x[0]) / (y[1]-y[0]) and rightDeltaX = (x[2] - x[0]) / (y[2]-y[0])</li>

"2069836","<p>I'm having difficulties reading in a .shp (esri shape file) into R.

<p>It probably has something to with the fact that my shape file contains 'regions' (multi-polygons) instead of 'polygons'... </p>

<p>How can I read that type of shape file correctly in R for plotting? (it looks like a normal shape in ArcMap)</p>

<p>Your shapefile has probably been read correctly. It is more likely that the plotting wasn't correct. Try spplot() instead of plot() :</p>

<pre><code>spplot(shp, col.regions=""gray"", col=""blue"")
</code></pre>

<p>If your shapefile has more than one column (which is likely), add zcol= 1 (or any other column) so you get only one panel</p>

<pre><code>spplot(shp, zcol=1, col.regions=""gray"", col=""blue"")

<p>If you really want to use plot you have to set a color for the background, because otherwise it will print the holes transparent. So set pbg=""white"". Try:</p>

<p>I am using anchor points and control points to create a shape using curveTo. It's all working fine, but I cannot figure out  how to get my lines to go through the center of the control points (blue dots) when the line is not straight.</p>

<p>Here is my code for drawing the shape:</p>

<pre><code>           // clear old line and draw new / begin fill
        var g:Graphics = graphics;
        g.clear();
        g.lineStyle(2, 0, 1);
        g.beginFill(0x0099FF,.1);

        //move to starting anchor point
        var startX:Number = anchorPoints[0].x;
        var startY:Number = anchorPoints[0].y;
        g.moveTo(startX, startY);

        // Connect the dots
        var numAnchors:Number = anchorPoints.length;
        for (var i:Number=1; i&lt;numAnchors; i++) {

            // curve to next anchor through control
            g.curveTo(controlPoints[i].x,controlPoints[i].y, anchorPoints[i].x, anchorPoints[i].y);

        }
        // Close the loop
        g.curveTo(controlPoints[0].x,controlPoints[0].y,startX,startY);
</code></pre>

<p>And the shape I'm drawing for reference:</p>

<p>How can I modify my code so that the lines go directly through the blue control points?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>If you're not interested in how this is derived, skip down to the answer section.</p>

<h2>Background Information</h2>

<p><br/>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezier_Curve"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bezier curves</a> are interesting and fun to work with. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bezier_2_big.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This animation</a> shows how your Quadratic curve is being drawn between the two anchor points (P0 and P2) over time with respect to the control point (P1).</p>

<p>What you need to do, instead of drawing the control point (P1), is draw the point on the curve at t=0.5:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/mcJOs.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/mcJOs.gif"" alt=""Point at t=0.5""></a><br>
<sub>(source: <a href=""http://whilenotnull.com/files/imagedump/stackoverflow/Bezier_2_t05.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">whilenotnull.com</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>Luckily this is easy to do with the equation given on the Wikipedia page: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezier_Curve#Quadratic_B.C3.A9zier_curves"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bezier_Curve#Quadratic_B.C3.A9zier_curves</a></p>

<p>Here is the formula in Actionscript:</p>

<pre><code>public function calculatePoint(p0:Point, p1:Point, p2:Point, t:Number):Point
{
    var p:Point = new Point(calculateTerm(p0.x, p1.x, p2.x, t), calculateTerm(p0.y, p1.y, p2.y, t));
    return p;
}

public function calculateTerm(p0:Number, p1:Number, p2:Number, t:Number):Number
{
    var negT:Number = 1 - t;

    var a0:Number = Math.pow(negT, 2) * p0;
    var a1:Number = 2 * negT * t * p1;
    var a2:Number = Math.pow(t, 2) * p2;

    var pos:Number = a0 + a1 + a2;
    return pos;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So if you plug the three points: <code>var t0:Point = calculatePoint(p0, p1, p2, 0.5);</code> you'll get the point on the curve where you want to draw your ""control point"".</p>

<hr>

<h2>Answer</h2>

<p>Now we can write a function that assumes the second parameter is a point on the curve and determine the co-ordinates of the control point:</p>

<pre><code>public function derivePoint(p0:Point, b1:Point, p2:Point, t:Number = 0.5):Point
{
    var p:Point = new Point(deriveTerm(p0.x, b1.x, p2.x, t), deriveTerm(p0.y, b1.y, p2.y, t));
    return p;
}

public function deriveTerm(p0:Number, bt:Number, p2:Number, t:Number):Number
{
    var negT:Number = 1 - t;

    var a0:Number = Math.pow(negT, 2) * p0;
    var a1:Number = 2 * negT * t;
    var a2:Number = Math.pow(t, 2) * p2;

    var p1:Number = (bt - a0 - a2) / a1;
    return p1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>From this I've updated your code snippet to (hopefully) draw the curve through your ""control points"":</p>

<pre><code>// clear old line and draw new / begin fill
var g:Graphics = graphics;
g.clear();
g.lineStyle(2, 0, 1);
g.beginFill(0x0099FF,.1);

//move to starting anchor point
var startX:Number = anchorPoints[0].x;
var startY:Number = anchorPoints[0].y;
g.moveTo(startX, startY);

// Connect the dots
var p0:Point = new Point(startX, startY);
var p2:Point;

var numAnchors:Number = anchorPoints.length;
for (var i:Number=1; i&lt;numAnchors; i++) {

    p2 = new Point(anchorPoints[i].x, anchorPoints[i].y);

    // curve to next anchor through control
    var b1:Point = new Point(controlPoints[i].x,controlPoints[i].y);
    var p1:Point = derivePoint(p0, b1, p2);

    g.curveTo(p1.x, p1.y, p2.x, p2.y);

    p0 = p2;

}
// Close the loop
g.curveTo(controlPoints[0].x,controlPoints[0].y,startX,startY);

","AVL TREE in c++","<c++><data-structures><avl-tree>","2010-01-16 09:20:57","2553","2076854","2","<h2>Original answer:</h2>

<p>Could it be that the node <code>4</code> on the stack has a different node <code>6</code> to its right (the one with node <code>7</code> to its right) than the node <code>6</code> (with the node <code>8</code> on its right) you're working on? You could compare their addresses to make sure you haven't got two different copies of node <code>6</code> around.</p>

<h2>Elaboration on the above argument:</h2>

<p>Let's look at your method's signature:</p>

<pre><code>void Avltree::attachwithtree(treeNode* tree, Stack&lt;treeNode&gt;&amp;s)
</code></pre>

<p><code>s</code> is defined as a reference to a <code>Stack&lt;treeNode&gt;</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Could it be that it should be a <code>Stack&lt;treeNode*&gt;</code>?</strong></p>

<p>Depending on your <code>treeNode</code> class, it's possible that when you push <code>X</code> on this stack, you actually end up with a copy of <code>X</code> and not <code>X</code> itself. Similarly, when you pop from the stack, you might not actually get the item you pushed, but an identical-looking copy of it!?</p>

<p>This would mean that, at the time when you push node <code>6</code> on the stack, its right child is node <code>7</code>. But you have pushed a new, identical node on the stack. Even if you pop this element from the stack and change it, you only change a copy and leave the original tree node as it was before.</p>

<p>Therefore, you'd operate on different copies of node <code>6</code>. First, you pop a copy of it from the stack, and append a tree as its right child. Checking this will give the right result.</p>

<p>Then, you pop a copy of node <code>4</code> from the stack. It's right child is node <code>6</code>, as expected, <strong>BUT</strong> not the one you just modified but the original! Therefore you get <code>7</code> on the right side of node <code>6</code>.</p>

<h2>Demonstrating the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference:</h2>

<p>OK, here's something you need to understand when working with pointers or references. It basically shows the difference between passing a parameter by value (a copy will be created) or passing it by reference (no copy will be created).</p>

<p>Study it carefully and then see how it applies to your problem.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

class someObject
{
private:
    int _value;
public:
    someObject(int value) : _value(value) { }

    int getValue()
    {
        return _value;
    }
};

void someFunction(someObject objCopy, someObject* objPtr)
{
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""objCopy.getValue() -&gt; "" &lt;&lt; objCopy.getValue() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    std::cout &lt;&lt; ""objPtr-&gt;getValue() -&gt; "" &lt;&lt; objPtr-&gt;getValue() &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    if ( &amp;objCopy != objPtr )
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""objCopy is not actually *objPtr but a copy of it."" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
    else
    {
        std::cout &lt;&lt; ""objCopy and *objPtr are one and the same object."" &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
}


int main()
{
    someObject X(17);
    someFunction(X, &amp;X);

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Hint</strong>: Yes, in your <code>pop</code> method, you work with pointers, but most likely with a pointer to a copy of the object originally pushed on the stack.</p>

"2079927","<p>I would like to create a ListView item layout where I can touch certain portions of a line item. This is similar to the behavior of the 2.0's Contacts Call Log where I can click on the green phone logo to initiate a call or click on the incoming call details to get more information about the contact.</p>

<p>I don't need a behavior only implementation. I already know to bind OnClickListeners to the portions of the line items where I want to capture the press. My real issue is that the UI doesn't react properly in certain cases when a user press against a certain area of the screen. IE: if they clicked the green phone icon, only the box around the phone will highlight as pressed. Where as pressing the name will highlight that area.</p>

<p>I looked at the source code for the contacts app but it's very complicated and I was able to get some success I have issues where the source code is referencing Drawables and resources that aren't exposed in the SDK itself.</p>

<p>I would like a reasonable implementation that does not rely on internal resource of android. Or at least some pointers in the right direction.</p>

<pre><code># Safety, should be a no-op if your gitk snapshot is accurate
git checkout backup

# Move top commit onto 'Fix for #226:
git rebase --onto origin/master HEAD^

# Go back to saved branch's parent (i.e. without the moved commit)
git reset --hard backup-save^

# Rebase onto the moved commit (HEAD@{1} is where HEAD was 1 step
# ago i.e. before the reset.)
git rebase HEAD@{1}

# Don't need the saved branch any more (although you might want

<p>The MSDN Visual C# Developer Center has a section called <strong>101 LINQ Samples</strong>.  I found this through a Bing search.</p>

<p>The code for <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcsharp/aa336758#SelectManyCompoundfrom1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SelectMany - Compound from 1</a> is:</p>

<pre><code>public void Linq14() {
    int[] numbersA = { 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 };
    int[] numbersB = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 };

    var pairs =
        from a in numbersA,
             b in numbersB
        where a &lt; b
        select new {a, b};

    Console.WriteLine(""Pairs where a &lt; b:"");
    foreach (var pair in pairs) {
        Console.WriteLine(""{0} is less than {1}"", pair.a, pair.b);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, <strong>this code won't compile</strong>.  I noticed that if I remove the comma at the end of <code>from a in numbersA,</code> and instead add <code>from</code> in front of <code>b in numbersB</code>, it will compile and work fine:</p>

<pre><code>        var pairs =
            from a in numbersA
            from b in numbersB
            where a &lt; b
            select new {a, b};
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if this is a bug in MSDN's example or if possibly I'm running a version of C# and .NET that doesn't support this syntax.</p>

<p>If I look at the breadcrumb at the top of the <strong>101 LINQ Samples</strong> website, I see it says ""Future Versions"".  Does this indicate that future versions of C#/.NET will support using a comma instead of <code>from</code> in LINQ syntax?</p>

"
"2083516","<p>I am trying to wrap my mind around the best way to implement nested state transitions in a single threaded programming language (Actionscript).  Say I have a structure like this behavior tree: <img src=""https://conkerjo.files.wordpress.com/2009/07/image2.png"" alt=""behavior tree""></p>

<p>Now imagine that each leaf node is a destination point on a website, like an image in a gallery, or a comment nested in a post view nested in a page view...  And the goal is to be able to run animated transitions from leaf node to leaf node, by animating out the previous tree (from bottom to top), and animating in the current tree (from top to bottom).</p>

<p>So, if we were at the bottom-left-most leaf node, and we wanted to go to the bottom-right-most leaf node, we would have to:</p>

<ul>
<li>transition out bottom-left-node</li>
<li>on complete (say after a second of animation), transition out it's parent,</li>
<li>on complete, transition out it's parent</li>
<li>on complete, transition IN the right-most parent</li>
<li>on complete, transition in right most-child</li>
<li>on complete, transition in leaf</li>
</ul>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p>If you imagine each of these nodes as HTML views (where the leaves are 'partials', borrowing the term from rails), or MXML views, where you're nesting sub components, and you don't necessarily know the nest levels from the application root, what is the best way to animate the transition as described above?</p>

<p>One way is to store all possible paths globally, and then to say ""Application, transition out this path, transition in this path"".  That works if the application is very simple.  That's how <a href=""http://www.gaiaflashframework.com/wiki/index.php?title=Pages"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gaia</a> does it, an Actionscript framework.  But if you want it to be able to transition in/out arbitrarily nested paths, you can't store that globally because:</p>

<ol>
<li>Actionscript couldn't handle all that processing</li>
<li>Doesn't seem like good encapsulation</li>
</ol>

<p>So this question can be reworded as, <em>how do you animate out the left-most-leaf node and it's parents, starting from the leaf, and animate in the right-most-leaf node, starting with the root?</em>  Where is that information stored (what to transition in and out)?</p>

<p>Another possible solution would be to just say ""Application, transition out previous child node, and when that's complete, transition in the current child node"", where the ""child node"" is the direct child of the application root.  Then the left-most child of the application root (which has two child nodes, which each have two child nodes), would check if it's in the right state (if it's children are 'transitioned out').  If not, it would call ""transitionOut()"" on them...  That way everything would be completely encapsulated.  But it seems like that'd be pretty processor intensive.</p>

<p>What do you think?  Do you have any other alternatives?  Or can you point me to any good resources on <a href=""http://aigamedev.com/open/articles/behavior-trees-part1/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AI Behavior Trees</a> or Hierarchical State Machines that describe how they practically implement asynchronous state transitions:</p>

<ul>
<li>From where do they call ""transitionOut"" on an object?  From the root or a specific child?</li>
<li>Where is the state stored?  Globally, locally?  What is the scope defining what calls ""transitionIn()"" and ""transitionOut()""?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have seen/read many articles/books on AI and State Machines, but I have yet to find something describing how they actually implement asychronous/animated transitions in a complex MVC Object Oriented Project with 100s of Views/Graphics participating in the behavior tree.</p>

<p>Should I call the transitions from the parent-most object, or from the child?</p>

<p>While this is not necessarily an AI problem, there are no other resources describing how to apply nested state architectures to websites; these are the closest things.</p>

<p>Another way to word the question: How do you broadcast state changes to the application?  Where do you keep the event listeners?  How do you find what view to animate when it's arbitrarily nested?</p>

<p>Note: I am not trying to build a game, just trying to build animated websites.</p>
","Best Practice for Transitioning From Nested State to Nested State (see diagram)","<optimization><actionscript><state-machine><hsm><behavior-tree>","2010-01-18 02:01:51","1600","2083868","3","<p>I'll try to simplify the problem before suggesting a possible approach. The transitions seem related to the views, and not the model. If I were to skip the transitions and go straight to some other leaf node, the application still works but there is not visual clue for the users. So I'd suggest you use a view-controller specifically to hold the current branch and the transitions of various views.</p>

<p>It's probably a better approach to split the two types of transitions into a sort of stack where a pop transition is to go back to a previous node, while a push transition goes forward in the hierarchy. Apple uses a similar technique to manage navigational applications using a <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UINavigationController_Class/Reference/Reference.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">navigation view controller</a>. It basically maintains a stack of view controllers that the user followed to get to a particular node. When a user goes back, the top item is popped off the stack, and the user sees the previous item. If the user goes deeper in the hierarchy, a new view controller is pushed onto the stack.</p>

<p>You would still need a global way to represent the hierarchies in a flyweight manner, while the navigation stack only stores the currently visible branch down to the leaf node.</p>

<p>If a user went from one leaf node to another, the current stack will be popped out upto the common parent. Then the global tree structure will be asked to get the path from that parent upto the new leaf node. This path of nodes is pushed into the current navigation stack, and as each item is pushed, the transition is shown.</p>

<p>In a simple algorithm, there'd be these two data structures and a way to get the entire branch that contains leaf node:</p>

<ol>
<li>a global representation of the tree</li>
<li>a stack of the current branch</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>initially:</strong></p>

<pre><code>stack = []
tree = create-tree()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>algorithm:</strong></p>

<pre><code>// empty current branch upto the common ancestor, root node if nothing else
until stack.peek() is in leaf-node.ancestors() {
    stack.pop() // animates the transition-out
}
parent = stack.peek();
// get a path from the parent to leaf-node
path = tree.get-path(parent, leaf-node)
for each node in path {
    stack.push(node) // animates the transition-in
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong>:</p>

<p>The entire application could have a single navigation controller, or multiple such controllers. A navigation controller only needs to know that there is a tree which exposes certain operations. So you could create an interface with those operations and let concrete subclasses implement that. </p>

<p>I can only think of two operations that would need to be exposed (pseudo-Java syntax):</p>

<pre><code>interface Tree {
    List&lt;Node&gt; getAncestors(node);
    List&lt;Node&gt; findPath(ancestorNode, descendantNode);
}
</code></pre>

<p>That should provide sufficient abstraction to keep the navigation controller poking inside the global tree structure. To take it to the next level, use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">dependency injection</a> so the tree object is injected into the navigation controller, improving testability and breaking the tree connection completely.</p>

<p>When I select different rows in the NSTableView, it magically updates the NSArrayController (PersonController) selection. How is the NSTableView doing this? Does it do something like this:</p>

"2094663","<p>I want to programmatically determine if the current user (or process) has access to create symbolic links. In Windows (Vista and greater), one cannot create a symbolic link without the SeCreateSymbolicLinkPrivilege and by default, this is only assigned to administrators. If one attempts to create a symbolic link without this privilege, a Windows error 1314 (A required privilege is not held by the client) occurs.</p>

<p>To demonstrate this restriction, I created a clean install of Windows, logged in as the initial Administrator account (restricted through UAC), and was unable to create a symlink in the home directory.</p>

<p><img src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/54081/linked/cant-create-symlink%202.png"" alt=""Command Prompt demonstrates mklink fails due to insufficient privilege""></p>

<p>After running the Command Prompt as Administrator or disabling UAC, that command executes without error.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms721532%28VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>, ""every process executed on behalf of the user has a copy of the [access] token"".</p>

<p>So I've created <a href=""https://svn.jaraco.com/jaraco/python/incubator/has-create-symlink-privilege.py"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a Python script to query for the permissions</a>. For convenience and posterity, I include an excerpt below.</p>

<p>The idea behind the script is to enumerate all privileges and determine if the process has the required privilege. Unfortunately, I find that the current process does not in fact have the desired privilege, even when it can create symlinks.</p>

<p>I suspect the problem is that even though the current user's privileges does not explicitly include the privilege, his group membership does afford that privilege.</p>

<p>In short, how can I determine if a given process will have privilege to create symbolic links (without attempting to create one)? An example in C or C++ or Python is preferred, though anything utilizing the Windows API will be suitable.</p>

"2095272","<p>I've been beating my head against a wall trying to figure out how I had a memory leak in a garbage collected Cocoa app. (The memory usage in Activity Monitor would just grow and grow, and running the app using the GC Monitor instruments would also show an ever-growing graph.)</p>

<p>I eventually narrowed it down to a single pattern in my code. Data was being loaded into an NSData and then parsed by a C library (the data's bytes and length were passed into it). The C library has callbacks which would fire and return sub-string starting pointers and lengths (to avoid internal copying). However, for my purposes, I needed to turn them into NSStrings and keep them around awhile. I did this by using NSString's initWithBytes:length:encoding: method. I assumed that would copy the bytes and NSString would manage it appropriately, but something is going wrong because this leaks like crazy.</p>

<p>This code will ""leak"" or somehow trick the garbage collector:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)meh
{
    NSData *data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""holmes"" ofType:@""txt""]];
    const int substrLength = 80;

    for (const char *substr = [data bytes]; substr-(const char *)[data bytes] &lt; [data length]; substr += substrLength) {
        NSString *cocoaString = [[NSString alloc] initWithBytes:substr length:substrLength encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
        [cocoaString length];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can put this in timer and just watch memory usage go up and up with Activity Monitor as well as with the GC Monitor instrument. (holmes.txt is 594KB)</p>

<p>This isn't the best code in the world, but it shows the problem. (I'm running 10.6, the project is targeted for 10.5 - if that matters). I read over the garbage collection docs and noticed a number of possible pitfalls, but I don't think I'm doing anything obviously against the rules here. Doesn't hurt to ask, though. Thanks!</p>

","Leaking memory with Cocoa garbage collection","<cocoa><garbage-collection>","2010-01-19 17:00:10","1340","2095885","1","<p>This is an unfortunate edge case.  Please file a bug (<a href=""http://bugreport.apple.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://bugreport.apple.com/</a>) and attach your excellent minimal example.</p>

<p>The problem is two fold;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The main event loop isn't running and, thus, the collector isn't triggered via MEL activity.  This leaves the collector doing its normal background only threshold based collections.</p></li>
<li><p>The data stores the data read from the file into a malloc'd buffer that is allocated from the malloc zone.  Thus, the GC accounted allocation -- the NSData object itself -- is really tiny, but points to something really large (the malloc allocation).  The end result is that the collector's threshold isn't hit and it doesn't collect.  Obviously, improving this behavior is desired, but it is a hard problem.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a very easy bug to reproduce in a micro-benchmark or in isolation.  In practice, there is typically enough going on that this problem won't happen.  However, there may be certain cases where it does become problematic.</p>

<p>Change your code to this and the collector will collect the data objects.  Note that you shouldn't use <code>collectExhaustively</code> often -- it does eat CPU.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)meh
{
    NSData *data = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""holmes"" ofType:@""txt""]];
    const int substrLength = 80;

    for (const char *substr = [data bytes]; substr-(const char *)[data bytes] &lt; [data length]; substr += substrLength) {
        NSString *cocoaString = [[NSString alloc] initWithBytes:substr length:substrLength encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
        [cocoaString length];
    }
    [data self];
    [[NSGarbageCollector defaultCollector] collectExhaustively];
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>[data self]</code> keeps the data object alive after the last reference to it.</p>

"2096385","<p>I need to implement a Geo proximity search in my application but I'm very confused regarding the correct formula to use. After some searches in the Web and in StackOverflow I found that the solutions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the <strong>Haversine Formula</strong></li>
<li><s>Use the <strong>Great-Circle Distance Formula</strong></s></li>
<li>Use a <strong>Spatial Search Engine</strong> in the Database</li>
</ol>

<p>Option #3 is really not an option for me ATM. Now I'm a little confused since I always though that the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Great-Circle Distance Formula</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Haversine Formula</a> were <strong>synonymous</strong> but apparently I was wrong?</p>

</p>

<p>The above screen shot was taken from the awesome <strong><a href=""http://www.arubin.org/files/geo_search.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Geo (proximity) Search with MySQL</a></strong> paper, and uses the following functions:</p>

<pre><code>ASIN, SQRT, POWER, SIN, PI, COS
</code></pre>

<p>I've also seen variations from the <strong><s>same formula</s> (<a href=""http://www.thismuchiknow.co.uk/?p=71"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Spherical Law of Cosines</a>)</strong>, like this one:</p>

<pre><code>(3956 * ACOS(COS(RADIANS(o_lat)) * COS(RADIANS(d_lat)) * COS(RADIANS(d_lon) - RADIANS(o_lon)) + SIN(RADIANS(o_lat)) * SIN(RADIANS(d_lat))))
</code></pre>

<p>That uses the following functions:</p>

<pre><code>ACOS, COS, RADIANS, SIN
</code></pre>

<p>I am not a math expert, but are these formulas the same? I've come across some <strong>more variations, and formulas</strong> (such as the <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_law_of_cosines"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Spherical Law of Cosines</a></strong> and the <strong><a href=""http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong-vincenty.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Vincenty's</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincenty%27s_formulae"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">formulae</a></strong> - which seems to be the most accurate) and that makes me even more confused...</p>

<p>I need to choose a good general purpose formula to implement in PHP / MySQL. Can anyone explain me the differences between the formulas I mentioned above?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Which one is the fastest to compute?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Which one provides the most accurate results?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Which one is the best in terms of speed / accuracy of results?</strong></li>

<p>Based on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2096385/formulas-to-calculate-geo-proximity/2097779#2097779"">theonlytheory</a> answer I tested the following Great-Circle Distance Formulas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vincenty Formula</li>
<li>Haversine Formula</li>
<li>Spherical Law of Cosines</li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>Vincenty Formula</strong> is dead slow, however <strong>it's pretty accurate (down to 0.5 mm)</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Haversine Formula</strong> is way faster than the Vincenty Formula, I was able to run 1 million calculations in about 6 seconds which is pretty much acceptable for my needs.</p>

<p>The <strong>Spherical Law of Cosines Formula</strong> revealed to be <strong>almost twice as fast</strong> as the Haversine Formula, and <strong>the precision difference is neglectfulness</strong> for most usage cases.</p>

<p>As you can see there is <strong>no noticeable difference</strong> between the Haversine Formula and the Spherical Law of Cosines, however both have <strong>distance offsets as high as 22 kilometers</strong> compared to the Vincenty Formula because it uses an ellipsoidal approximation of the earth instead of a spherical one.</p>
","Formulas to Calculate Geo Proximity","<php><mysql><math><geospatial><geo>","2010-01-19 19:25:08","27981","2097779","2","<p>The Law of Cosines and the Haversine Formula will give identical results assuming a machine with infinite precision. The Haversine formula is more robust to floating point errors. However, today's machines have double precision of the order of 15 significant figures, and the law of cosines may work just fine for you. Both these formulas assume spherical earth, whereas Vicenty's iterative solution (most accurate) assumes ellipsoidal earth (in reality the earth is not even an ellipsoid - it is a geoid). Some references:
<a href=""http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/gis-faq-5.1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/gis-faq-5.1.html</a></p>
<p>It gets better: note the latitude to be used in the law of cosines as well as the Haversine is the geocentric latitude, which is different from geodetic latitude. For a sphere, these two are the same.</p>
<p>Which one is fastest to compute?</p>
<p>In order from fastest to slowest are: law of cosines (5 trig. calls) -&gt; haversine (involves sqrt) -&gt; Vicenty (have to solve this iteratively in a for loop)</p>
<p>Which one is most accurate?</p>
<p>Vicenty.</p>
<p>Which one is best when speed and accuracy are both considered?</p>
<p>If your problem domain is such that for the distances you are trying to calculate, the earth can be considered as flat, then you can work out (I am not going to give details) a formula of the form <code>x = kx * difference</code> in longitude, <code>y = ky * difference</code> in latitude. Then <code>distance = sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)</code>. If your problem domain is such that it can be solved with distance squared, then you won't have to calculate the sqrt, and this formula will be as fast as you get possibly get. It has the added advantage that you can calculate the <strong>vector</strong> distance - x is distance in east direction, and y is distance in the north direction.
Otherwise, experiment with the 3 and choose what works best in your situation.</p>

"2096518","<p>Using my iPhone, I would like to measure human flatulence in order to measure, quantify, and provide a statistical report based on various properties of the overall event quality.  Outrageous, maybe. Fun, definitely.  If I'm going to ""release"" an iPhone app, I want to do it in style. That's right, I want to measure farts/stinkers/toots.</p>

<p>So that bring's me to my question,</p>

<p>In order to provide an extremely accurate analysis, at a very minimum, I would need to be able to measure a propagating wave packet, specifically one that would measure the envelope of a burst, distance between adjacent peaks, momentum, and velocity.</p>

<p><strong>A propagating Wave Packet</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b0/Wave_packet_%28dispersion%29.gif"" alt=""A propagating Wave Packet""></p>

<p>As I am no sound expert of sound analysis, I was wondering if there are development libraries available for sound analysis that would provide a robust set of tools with the qualifications as I mentioned above?</p>

<p>For those scope-creepers out there, your ideas are welcome, however, leave ideas only as comments, as I am seriously looking for an answer to my issue.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note</strong> I am aware of other flatulence measuring applications, which measure purely on the volume and length of the event, but none that would provide the level of quality I am looking for in this ground/wind-breaking application.</em></p>

Let me illustrate it first:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/1Kfgs.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/1Kfgs.jpg"" alt=""Navigation Interface - Hourglass like"" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Situation</strong><br />
I have 26 items (in this example, in general the number is not known..) but only 12 can be visible at one time.. I also have some navigation elements (the green boxes)</p>
<p>Width of purple and green boxes is fixed but height of purple can vary according to content ..</p>
<p>All is normal and i can do it with css.</p>
<p>I am using an unordered list (of floated items) for my items and i have designated the first two <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements as the navigations ones. First has float left and second float right.
It all works and the flow of the rest of the items goes between the two green ones.</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong><br />
But now i need the green items to be on the second row (or last if that concept helps as there will only be two rows)</p>
<p>I want to be able to hide the first X elements and show the next X  and they fall in position on their own ..</p>
<p>To rephrase the question, can i position some elements (the green ones) in such a way to control their position but still allow them to interfere with the flow from their new locations ?</p>
<p>I hope this is clear. If not ask away and i will provide as much info as possible..</p>
<p><strong>Things i have tried that did not work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moving the green item with negative bottom margins, or positive top margins. They will move out of their place but the other elements will not fill in their position.</li>
<li>Using absolute position, but then the elements are completely removed from the flow and they do not affect the other elements so they overlap with the other elements..</li>

"2099765","<p>I have a custom Expander control called <code>SpecialExpander</code>. It is basically just a standard <code>Expander</code> with a fancy header and a couple properties (<code>HeaderText</code> and <code>IsMarkedRead</code>).</p>

<p>Then I created a style that sets a couple properties on the expander (e.g., margins, padding, etc.) and, importantly, it also defines a custom <code>DataTemplate</code> for the <code>HeaderTemplate</code> property. The template is basically a grid with two rows.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How can I build a <code>DataTemplate</code> for my <code>SpecialExpander</code> so that the header has some fixed content (top row) and a place-holder for custom content (bottom row)?</p>

<p>For the second illustration, I would want to be able to do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;SpecialExpander HeaderText=""&lt;Expander Header Text&gt;"" IsMarkedRead=""True""&gt;
    &lt;SpecialExpander.Header&gt;
        &lt;StackPanel Orientation=""Horizontal""&gt;
            &lt;RadioButton Content=""High"" /&gt;
            &lt;RadioButton Content=""Med"" /&gt;
            &lt;RadioButton Content=""Low"" /&gt;
        &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
    &lt;SpecialExpander.Header&gt;
    &lt;Grid&gt;
        &lt;Label&gt;Main Content Goes Here&lt;/Label&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/SpecialExpander&gt;

<p>Path finding is a well-known problem, and there are many algorithms that solve this. Since your graph is quite small, the best solution here is probably just a brute force algorithm.

<p><strong>Brute force:</strong> Start at some pokemon and explore all possible ways to see if one leads to an identical pokemon. You can stop exploring a way if the way is blocked or has more than 2 turns.</p>

<p>You'll need some ""pointer"" pointing to a field in the grid. The pointer can move left, right, up or down, provided that the field in that direction is not blocked. Move the pointer to an adjacent field. Remember where you came from and how many turns you made. Repeat this until you've reached your destination. Backtrack if the number of turns reaches 3.

<p>I have successfully managed to get a latitude and longitude and plot it onto this map by taking the leftmost longitude and rightmost longitude of the UK and using them to work out where to put the point on the map.</p>

<p>This is the code (for use in Processing.js but could be used as js or anything):</p>

<pre><code>// Size of the map
int width = 538;
int height = 811;
// X and Y boundaries
float westLong = -8.166667;
float eastLong = 1.762833;
float northLat = 58.666667;
float southLat = 49.95;

void drawPoint(float latitude, float longitude){

 fill(#000000);

 x = width * ((westLong-longitude)/(westLong-eastLong));
 y = (height * ((northLat-latitude)/(northLat-southLat)));

 console.log(x + "", "" + y);
 ellipseMode(RADIUS);
 ellipse(x, y, 2, 2);    

}
</code></pre>

<p>However, I haven't been able to implement a Mercator projection on these values. The plots are reasonably accurate but they are not good enough and this projection would solve it.</p>

<p>I can't figure out how to do it. All the examples I find are explaining how to do it for the whole world. <a href=""http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Mercator"" rel=""noreferrer"">This</a> is a good resource of examples explaining how to implement the projection but I haven't been able to get it to work.</p>

Without knowing more about that map in particular, it's hard to be sure. You may find that most maps of a small area of the world are more likely to be a <em>conical</em> type projection, where the area of interest on the map is ""flatter"" than would be on a global Mercator projection. This is especially more important the further you get away from the equator (and the UK is far enough away for it to matter).</p>

<p>You may be able to get ""close enough"" using the calculations you're trying, but for best accuracy you may want to either use a map with a well-defined projection, or create your own map.</p>

"2103959","<p>During a migration of reports which contain EAN128 / Code128 barcodes to Fast Report I found that Fast Report does not use the correct symbology. The lines of a Code128 barcode are very wide so that they are perfect for long distance scanning in a warehouse. I reported it, but only received a recommendation for a third-party barcode library. This one seems to use the correct symbology but it is still in development (for many months now) and not working with Fast Report in Delphi 2009 yet.</p>

<p>Are there other Code128 / EAN128 barcode libraries available for Fast Report?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: one month later. In the meantime we have received source code from the third-party barcode developer - but it is the same buggy code we received in October 2009. So our projectas are stuck with
* Fast Reports wrong Code128 implementation
* incomplete and buggy third party library
* too little time to implement this ourself, so we still use the Delphi 7 printing system based on QuickReport</p>

"2112766","<p>This question is based on a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/992509/determining-if-a-dataset-approximates-a-sine-wave"">previous similar question.</a></p>

<p>I have the following equation and an adjusted (some random data): 0.44*sin(N* 2*PI/30)</p>

<p>I am trying to use the FFT to get the frequency from the data generated. However the frequency ends up being close but not equal to the frequency (which makes the wave a bit larger than intended)</p>

<p>The frequencies that are at the maximum for the FFT is 7hz, however the expected frequency is (30/2PI) 4.77hz.</p>

<p>I've included a graph of the FFT and plotted values.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/zazsr.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The code I am using is:</p>

<pre><code>[sampleFFTValues sFreq] = positiveFFT(sampledata, 1);
sampleFFTValues = abs(sampleFFTValues);
[v sFFTV]= max(sampleFFTValues)
</code></pre>

<p>Positive FFT can be <a href=""http://blinkdagger.com/matlab/matlab-introductory-fft-tutorial/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">found here</a>. Basically it centers the FFT graph and cuts off the negative signals.</p>

<p>My question is how can I get the FFT to be more accurate without having to resort to least squares for just the frequency?</p>
","Sine wave frequency fitting","<math><matlab><fft><octave><data-fitting>","2010-01-21 20:46:57","10050","2112980","7","<p>I don't think FFT is good for a fine-resolution frequency measurement for (quasi)periodic signals - see below.</p>

<p>Every discrete FFT has spreading on non-integer bin frequencies (that is on any frequency which does not exactly correspond to one of the frequency steps of the particular FFT); these ""intermediate"" frequencies will be smeared/spread out around the nearest integer bin. The shape of this spreading (""spreading function"") depends on the windowing function used for the FFT. This spreading function - to simplify and generalize things - is either very narrow but very-very ragged (very high peaks/very low valleys), or wider but less ragged. In theory, you could do a very fine frequency sweep of sine waves and calculate FFT for each of them, and then you could ""calibrate"" the function's shape and behaviour by saving outputs of all FFTs together with the frequency that resulted in that output, and then by comparing the FFT output of the signal to be measured to the previously saved results and finding the ""closest"" one find a more exact frequency.</p>

<p>Lots of effort.</p>

<p>But don't do this if you only need to measure frequency of a single signal.</p>

<p>Instead try to measure wavelength. This can be as simple as measuring the distance between zero crosses (perhaps for multiple cycles to get more precision - heck, measure 1000 cycles if you have that many) in samples, and divide the sample rate by that to arrive at the frequency. Much simpler, faster and much more precise.</p>

<p>Example: 48000 Hz sample rate, 4.77 Hz signal results in ~0.0005 Hz resolution just by measuring the length of <strong>one</strong> cycle with the crudest approach. (If you take <em>n</em> cycles, the frequency resolution multiplies by <em>n</em> as well.)</p>

<p><strong>I'm interested in knowing if there are any CSS-only UI frameworks.</strong></p>

<p>I found <a href=""http://woork.blogspot.com/2009/01/10-beautiful-web-ui-libraries.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>this page with a very nice list of Web UI Libraries</strong></a>, but most of them (at least the good ones) seem to be specific to Java, are there any equally good alternatives in pure CSS or JS?</p>

<p><strong>PS: I'm not interested in AJAX, effects, behaviors and so on... my main (only) concern is style.</strong></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Thanks for all the suggestions everyone!</strong></p>

<p>After a very careful consideration of all the UI libraries suggested, I've come to the conclusion that ExtJS and Qooxdoo are the ones that most closely fit my needs. jQuery UI seems promising but only offers a reduced amount of elements.</p>

<p>As far as CSS-only libraries go I've found BlueTrip / BluePrint and the themes suggested by tambler to be the best. Aside from that, Flex and Napkee also seem to be worth exploring.</p>

<p><strong>Time to learn ExtJS now! =)</strong></p>

I wanted to help because I thought I could learn something by doing so, but I needed your markup, or better yet, the whole solution! I struggled through the ""Error executing child request for ChartImg.axd"" when I tried a simple page with a chart. I discovered I needed to add a handler in the config. I then fought through the failure to load assembly System.Web.DataVisualization because the handler element I copied referenced the 3.5 DataVisualization assembly so I changed that to 4.0 and finally saw a graph. What a job THAT was!</p>

<p>The reason your spacer series is not creating a gap is because there are no values in that series. Notice the last two lines of code below, that add zero values to the spacer series. This produces the desired gap between the other series, but you will also find the spacer series listed in your legend if you have one, which is ugly to say the least.</p>

<pre><code>  for (var c = start; c &lt; start + 6; c++)
  {
   var color = colors[c % colors.Count];
   var seriesName = ""Series ""+ c;//color.Name);
   Chart1.Series.Add(seriesName);
   Chart1.Series[seriesName].BorderColor = color;
   Chart1.Series[seriesName].BorderWidth = 1;
   Chart1.Series[seriesName].Color = Color.FromArgb((int)(255 * .7), color);
   Chart1.Series[seriesName].BackSecondaryColor = Color.FromArgb((int)(255 * .2), color);
   Chart1.Series[seriesName].BackGradientStyle = GradientStyle.TopBottom;
   for (var year = DateTime.Now.AddYears(-5).Year; year &lt; DateTime.Now.Year; year++)
    Chart1.Series[seriesName].Points.Add(new DataPoint(year, rng.Next(0, 20)));

   Chart1.Series[seriesName][""PointWidth""] = (0.6).ToString();

   seriesName = ""Spacer:"" + seriesName;
   Chart1.Series.Add(seriesName);
   Chart1.Series[seriesName][""PointWidth""] = (0.6).ToString();
   for (var year = DateTime.Now.AddYears(-5).Year; year &lt; DateTime.Now.Year; year++)
    Chart1.Series[seriesName].Points.Add(new DataPoint(year, 0));
  }
</code></pre>

<p>You can set the legend text to a space (NB. empty string is ignored and legend text is not set) as follows, but the Legend will still show these spacer series.</p>

<pre><code>    Chart1.Series[seriesName].LegendText = "" "";
</code></pre>

<p>If you're lucky, you won't need to show the legend, or you can set the spacer series colours to the same colour as the legend background and the legend text to spaces. This results in a double-spacing look in the Legend which is likely to be acceptable.</p>

Then simple algorithm like the following should work:</p>

<pre><code>  int x=0, y=0;   
  add(x, y); // add the first cell
  int N=1 
  for( int N=1; &lt;some condition&gt;; ++N ) {
    for(int i=0; i&lt;N; ++i) add(++x, y);  // move right
    for(int i=0; i&lt;N-1; ++i) add(x, ++y); // move down right. Note N-1
    for(int i=0; i&lt;N; ++i) add(--x, ++y); // move down left
    for(int i=0; i&lt;N; ++i) add(--x, y); // move left
    for(int i=0; i&lt;N; ++i) add(x, --y); // move up left

"2143032","<p>I have a <code>Grid</code> displaying rectangles. The <code>Grid</code> can be resized and is supposed to display adjacent rectangles without any gap.</p>

<p>However, depending on the actual size of the <code>Grid</code>, blank lines appear between the rows and columns of the <code>Grid</code>. I guess this is to make up for sizes where the width isn't a multiple of the number of columns, or the height isn't a multiple of the number of rows.</p>

<p>The following XAML code demonstrates this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window x:Class=""test.Window1""
xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""
Title=""Window1"" Height=""300"" Width=""300""&gt;

&lt;Grid&gt;
    &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
        &lt;ColumnDefinition&gt;&lt;/ColumnDefinition&gt;
        &lt;ColumnDefinition&gt;&lt;/ColumnDefinition&gt;
    &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
    &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
        &lt;RowDefinition&gt;&lt;/RowDefinition&gt;
        &lt;RowDefinition&gt;&lt;/RowDefinition&gt;
    &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
    &lt;Rectangle Grid.Column=""0"" Grid.Row=""0"" Fill=""DarkBlue""&gt;&lt;/Rectangle&gt;
    &lt;Rectangle Grid.Column=""1"" Grid.Row=""0"" Fill=""DarkOrange""&gt;&lt;/Rectangle&gt;

    &lt;Rectangle Grid.Column=""1"" Grid.Row=""1"" Fill=""DarkBlue""&gt;&lt;/Rectangle&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;

&lt;/Window&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>How can I prevent those blank lines? If one or some of the columns/rows are slightly larger than others is not really a problem. I'd like to keep the markup simple.</p>

<p>I unsuccessfully tried <code>Stretch</code>, <code>Fill</code>, putting the <code>Grid</code> in a <code>ViewBox</code>, <code>ShowGridLines=False, Width=Auto</code>, etc.</p>

"2143690","<p>I am working on a game where I want to create shadows under a series of sprites on a grid.  The shadows are larger than the sprites themselves and the sprites are animated (i.e. move and rotate).</p>

<p>I cannot simply render them into the sprite png, or the shadows will overlap adjacent sprites.</p>

<p>I also cannot simply put shadows on a lower layer by themselves, because when they overlap, they will create dark bands at their intersection.</p>

<p>These sprites are animated, so it is not feasible to render these en masse.</p>

<p>Basically, I want the sprites' shadows to blend together such that they max out at a set opacity.  Example:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/58sPp.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/58sPp.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>I believe this is equivalent to an openGL blending of (Rs,Gs,Bs,Max(As,Ds)), where I don't really care about R,G, and B, as it will always be the same color in src and dst.</p>

<p>However, this is not a valid openGL blending mode.  Is there an easy way to accomplish this, especially in cocos2d-iphone?</p>

<p>I would be able to approximate this by making the shadow sprites opaque, then applying them both to a parent sprite, and making the parent sprite 40% opacity.  However, the way cocos2d works, this only sets the opacity of each child to 40%, rather than the combined sprite image, which results in the same stripe.</p>
","Is it possible to achieve MAX(As,Ad) openGL blending?","<iphone><graphics><opengl-es><cocos2d-iphone><alphablending>","2010-01-27 00:12:59","5627","2145170","1","<p>OK, I think after much research, I realize the error in my thinking.</p>

<p>First, there is a way to do Max Alpha openGL blending, and that is using glBlendEquations.  You would have to modify the draw method to do this (and make some new attribute for a textureNode to switch between these methods), and use either of these: </p>

<pre><code> glBlendEquationOES( GL_MAX_EXT );
 glBlendEquationSeparateOES( GL_FUNC_ADD_OES, GL_MAX_EXT );
</code></pre>

<p>The first uses max() for RGBA, while the second uses standard addition for RGB, and max() for alpha.</p>

<p>Now, the problem is that each sprite, and it's children, in z-order, are drawn to the <strong><em>screen</em></strong>.  This means, that after the first shadow is drawn, it is part of the main screen buffer.  In other words, its opacity is changed, and with max() blending and a standard opaque background, it's now painted onto the background, so when you draw the next shadow, it will do max(As, 1) which is 1, because the background is opaque.  So I don't achieve the blending I want.  It would ""work"" if my background was transparent, but then I could not apply any background ""behind"" that, we can only add to the buffer.</p>

<p>I could draw the shadows first, using the max() blend and then do a {ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA, DST_ALPHA} glBlend.  This is an OK workaround, but I have other issues that make this difficult.</p>

<p>Now, the real solution, I finally realize, is to use a RenderTexture to render the shadows to a separate buffer before applying them to the background.  This could have performance implications, so we'll see where this goes.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>OK, I have a working solution now.</p>

<p>Oddly, I ended up not needing this solution after all, because in my particular case, the banding was not noticeable enough to warrant the effort, however this is the solution I came up with that seemed to do what I wanted:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First draw a 0% black alpha png to the entire screen.  (I don't know if this is necessary.  I don't know what the default alpha of the screen is).</p></li>
<li><p>Draw the shadows to the screen using <code>glEquationSeperateOES( GL_ADD, GL_MAX_ENT)</code> and <code>glBlend( GL_ONE, GL_ONE )</code>.  This will blend all of the shadows together as described, taking the max() of the alphas.  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Because you are compositing to black, it is equivalent to use <code>glBlendEquationOES( GL_MAX_ENT )</code>.   (X+0 == max(X,0))</p></li>
<li><p><code>glBlend( GL_ZERO, GL_ONE )</code> will eliminate the need of step 1, or at least the requirement of that layer to be 0% black.  <code>GL_ZERO</code> essentially forces it to be 0% black.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Draw the floor, which will be <strong>over</strong> the shadows, but use <code>glBlend( ONE_MINUS_DST_ALPHA, DST_ALPHA )</code>.  This results in exactly the same results as if you added the shadows to the floor with <code>glBlend( SRC_ALPHA, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA )</code>, however if you did it this way, you would not be able to blend the shadows together (read why at top of answer).</p></li>
<li><p>You are done!  The nice thing about this method is that the shadow sprites can be animated as usual, without having to call ""visit"" on a separate renderTexture.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>The rest:</strong></p>

<p>I also modified CocosNode to allow me to add a shadow to a layer, which links to another CocosNode.  This way, the shadow is rendered as a child of the floor, (or the 0% black background sprite for the shadow blending), but is linked to another CocosNode.  When a sprite moves, if it has a shadow, it updates the shadows position as well.  This allows me to have all shadows below all objects on the screen, and to have the shadows automatically follow the object.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long answer.  Maybe my solution is kludgy, but it seems to work great.</p>

"2153466","<p>I have an assignment in my C programming class to write a program to get the correlation coefficient of 2 sets of real numbers.  I've been given the equations, and it referenced wikipedia so I double checked the equations there.  Here is a link to the equation, which seems to be pretty standard from my research:</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/0/4/e/04e3ee493ddb1f01e03d8bf024fbd0a5.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I've written the program, but when I ran it I was getting numbers greater than 1 for my results, which I knew wasn't correct.  I looked over my code several times but couldn't find anything out of place, so I tried dividing by n at the end instead of n-1, this gave me values with the -1 to 1 range that I expected, so i tested it against data values that I found online as well as a correlation coefficient calculator ( <a href=""http://easycalculation.com/statistics/correlation.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://easycalculation.com/statistics/correlation.php</a> ) and I'm now getting correct results for all of the numbers I input.  I can't figure out why this is, so thought I might be able to get a little help with it here.  Here is my code for the program, If there is anything else that stands out that I have done wrong here I would love to hear some advice, but mostly I'm trying to figure out why I'm getting the right results with what appears to be the wrong equation.</p>

","Odd Pearson correlation coefficient results","<c>","2010-01-28 09:31:23","6980","2153575","1","<p>You are calculating your standard deviation as:</p>

<pre><code>sx = sqrt((sx / n));
</code></pre>

<p>and similarly for <code>sy</code>.</p>

<p>The equation you have used uses <code>n-1</code> in the denominator for calculating this (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation#With_sample_standard_deviation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reason</a>: there are <code>n-1</code> degrees of freedom, so you should divide by <code>n-1</code>).  So, your <code>sx</code> and <code>sy</code> are actually <code>sx'</code> and <code>sy'</code>, where <code>sx' = sx*sqrt(n-1)/sqrt(n)</code>, and <code>sy' = sy*sqrt(n-1)/sqrt(n)</code>.  So, <code>sx' * sy' = sx * sy * (n-1)/n</code>.   Since <code>sx*sy</code> is in the denominator, your calculation is off by a factor of <code>n/(n-1)</code>.  Dividing this by <code>n</code> gives you the factor you need outside of the summation.</p>

<p>So if you changed your code to calculate the sample standard deviation (divide by <code>n-1</code>), you can finally divide by <code>n-1</code> and your code will get the result you expect.  For efficiency, since the division is going to cancel out anyway, you can save some computation and increase your accuracy by simply not dividing by <code>n-1</code> in calculations of <code>sx</code> and <code>sy</code>, and then omit the final division as well:</p>

<pre><code>sx = sqrt((sx / n));
sy = sqrt((sy / n));
</code></pre>

<p>become</p>

<pre><code>sx = sqrt(sx);
sy = sqrt(sy);
</code></pre>

<p>and:</p>

<pre><code>r /= (n);
</code></pre>

<p>goes away altogether.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>: Since you asked...</p>

<ol>
<li>There is no reason to use <code>float</code> unless you have to.  <code>double</code> gives you much better precision.</li>
<li>By default, <code>stdout</code> is line buffered on most systems, so your prompt may not appear before your call to <code>scanf()</code>.  To make sure your prompt shows, do <code>fflush(stdout);</code> after your <code>printf()</code> call.</li>
<li>It is very hard to use <code>scanf()</code> safely.  For reading numbers, <code>scanf()</code> has undefined behavior when someone enters a number that's not in the range of the data type.  Also, it is bad for cases like when someone enters a non-integer in response to your prompt.  For your case, you can make <code>n</code> passable as a command-line parameter, and then use <code>strtol(argv[1])</code> to parse the number.  If you want to read from <code>stdin</code> anyway, use <code>fgets() + sscanf()</code> combination, or <code>fgets() + strtol()</code>.</li>
<li>You can reduce the number of loops in your program.  For one, you can calculate <code>xbar</code> and <code>ybar</code> in the same loop.  Even better, you can write a function <code>double avg(double *data, int n)</code>, that calculates average of <code>n</code> values, and then do: <code>xbar=avg(x, n);</code>, <code>ybar=avg(y, n);</code>.</li>
<li>Similarly, you can define a function <code>double std(double *data, int n)</code>, and then use that to calculate <code>sx</code> and <code>sy</code>.</li>
<li>Finally, although it's okay, you have way too many parentheses: <code>sqrt((sx / n));</code> is better written as <code>sqrt(sx / n);</code>.  <code>r /= (n);</code> doesn't need the parentheses either.</li>

<p>To locate the component to the position you want it, you'll probably have to walk the component graph and manipulate it. This would be a very fragile approach and you may be better off just building your own dialog.</p>

<p>This could incorporate a file chooser:</p>

<pre><code>JFileChooser chooser = new JFileChooser();

"2156644","<p>I'm building a video player here: <a href=""http://leongaban.com/stackoverflow/RTMP/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://leongaban.com/stackoverflow/RTMP/</a></p>

<p>It's streaming RTMP, and I'm trying to get my video to seek correctly if the user clicks on the groove bar (gray bar under the green progress bar) Currently it does not seek and gives me a NaN on my duration variable and an error on my progress bar width variable, which is puzzling me.</p>

<p><img src=""https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4069/4311254491_aae9b02295_o.gif"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>For some reason my <strong>videoDuration variable is coming up as NaN</strong> when used inside of my seeker function, also I'm getting a null object reference error when trying to trace out playerCntrls.progressTotalW which is the total width of the groove bar:</p>

<h2>VideoDisplay.as</h2>

<pre><code>public function seeker(e:MouseEvent):void
{
    trace(""clicked the groove bar"");
    trace(""mouseX = ""+mouseX);
    trace(""videoDuration = ""+videoDuration);
    trace(""playerCntrls.progressTotalW = ""+playerCntrls.progressTotalW);

    ns.seek(Math.round(mouseX * videoDuration / playerCntrls.progressTotalW));
    playerCntrls.progressBar.width = mouseX * playerCntrls.progressTotalW / videoDuration;
}
</code></pre>

<p>[TRACES]</p>

<pre><code>clicked the groove bar
mouseX = 135
videoDuration = NaN
TypeError: Error #1009: Cannot access a property or method of a null object reference.
</code></pre>

<p>However in my updateDisplay function I don't get any errors tracing or using those same variables:</p>

<pre><code>private function updateDisplay(e:TimerEvent):void
{
   currentTime = ns.time;
   currentFormattedTime = convertTime(currentTime);

   playerCntrls.updateTime();
   playerCntrls.progressBar.width = ns.time * playerCntrls.progressTotalW / videoDuration;
   trace(""videoDuration = ""+videoDuration);
   trace(""ns.time        = ""+ns.time);
   trace(""Progress Width = ""+playerCntrls.progressBar.width);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is where I set the videoDuration var:</p>

<pre><code>function getMetaData(client_ns) 
{
    var metaData:Object = new Object();
    metaData.onMetaData = function(metaData:Object):void 
    {

    videoDuration = metaData.duration;
    trace(""metadata duration = ""+videoDuration);

    tmrDisplay.start();
    }
    return client_ns.client = metaData;
}
</code></pre>

<p>playerCntrls links to my PlayerControls.as</p>

<pre><code>public var playerCntrls:PlayerControls;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>PlayerControls.as</h2>

<p>Now this is where I add an EventListener in my PlayerControls.as to call the seeker function in my VideoDisplay.as</p>

<pre><code>// Create Progress Bar ··········································
    public function createProgress():void
    {
        progressBar               = new ProgBar;

        progressBar.mouseChildren = false;

        progressBar.x     = grooveX;
        progressBar.y     = grooveY;
        progressBar.width = 1;

        progressBar_color = progressBar.colorChip;
        TweenLite.to(progressBar_color, .1, {tint:xmlColor});
        controls.addChild(groove);
        controls.addChild(progressBar);

        groove.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, videoDsply.seeker);
    }

"2157133","<p>I've compiled an assembly for <code>MySql.Data.dll</code> and would like to add it to a new Visual Studio Project.  I'm lost on the correct terminology and how best to go about this, but the end goal is to distribute this dll so that it's included with the application when the application runs.  This is to avoid having to GAC the dll on the end user's machine.</p>

<p>I've tried simply copying the assembly into the project folder:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i474.photobucket.com/albums/rr103/ossavir/Dll_addreference.png""/></p>

<p>However, I can't figure out how to add a reference to that dll in the current project. Nor have I figured out how to ensure that this dll will ""stay with"" the application once it is compiled.  How might this be accomplished and what other things might I consider?</p>

<p>After Google'ing the error for a while I came to see that this is a problem when running the application in 64-bit mode. If I was to compile the application in 32-bit it would work, so I went to try and find out how to do it. I got as far as the advanced compiling options in my projects settings page, but then I also read that I can't even set the CPU type in Visual Basic 2008 Express.</p>

<p>Is this true? Is there no way I can set my project to run in 32-bit mode? The thing is, I did a similar thing with a database a few months ago and this worked, and I don't remember in the slightest what I did.</p>

<p>How do I fix this problem?</p>

<p>After taking a look at my old projects compiling options, it is indeed set for <code>Active (x86) Platform</code>, but this option is not showing up in my new project. Weird.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot. The top one is the old project with the 32-bit running option and the bottom is the new one without those options.</p>

<p>Edit2: adding the error image. So how should I configure the child app pool. The child app runs in the same app pool as that of parent</p>

<p>Edit3: sorry, the child was running on a different app pool. A generic app  worked(without modules). I am marking the answer after I try out the modules.Thanks for your help guys. There is something specific in my parent app web.config, which I am going to hunt down now.</p>

<p>I have functionality that uses an adorner.  The adorner attaches itself to a specified framework element.</p>

<p>This functionality is invoked when the user clicks on a button that is located in the upper-right corner of the grid named NavigationGrid.  The button containins an icon of a pushpin.  This functionality removes the NavigationGrid grid from it's parent's children, and adds it to the children of the LayoutRoot grid.  The adorner allows the user to be able to drag the grid around the screen.</p>

<p>If the user clicks on the pushpin button again, the intended functionality is for the grid to be removed from the LayoutRoot children, and to be added back to it's original parent's children, with the Grid.Column, Grid.RowSpan etc. values.</p>

<p>The problem I am running into is when the NavigationGrid grid is initially removed from it's parent's children, all of the other elements in the grid resize etc.  This is ok, as it is what I wanted.  But, when the grid is placed back into it's parent's children, it's location is not the same as it was originally.  I checked the Margin property, and it is set to 0.  So, because it's location is not identical to it's original location, I programatically set it's margin to a negative value that puts it back visually to where it was originally.  This throws off the location of the other elements, and everything begins to overlap etc.</p>

<p>So, my question is, does anyone know how I can achieve this functionality such that the NavigationGrid grid can be removed from it's parent and later placed back into it's parent, with it's original placement/location being in tact?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Below is a screenshot of the UI.  For obvious reasons, I have blacked out certain parts of the UI.  The grid on the left, with the label ""Processes"", is the grid that the user should be able to 'unpin' and move around, which does work, it's the functionality that places it back in place that creates the problem.</p>

"2165571","<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>

<p>I have a MS SQL application that reads data from our Oracle billing database once an hour, looking for new payments.  It does this by storing a timestamp based on the <code>CRT_DTTM</code> of the most recent timestamp found each time it runs.  </p>

<p><em>e.g.</em></p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM V_TRANS
WHERE TRANS_CLS = 'P'
AND CRT_DTTM &gt; TO_DATE('2010-01-25 12:59:44', 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24-MI-SS')
</code></pre>

<p>After this result is returned, the <code>MAX(CRT_DTTM)</code> is stored as the starting timestamp for the next hourly run.</p>

<p>What appears to be happening is that sometimes there's a transaction running on the Oracle side that is inserting data into the table at the same time I'm running my query.  The rows are seemingly not being inserted in order of the timestamp they got.  This means that my <code>MAX(CRT_DTTM)</code> is greater than some of the rows that get inserted after my query completes.  I've missed payment information, and my systems are out of balance.</p>

<p>I believe that I can work around this by simply modifying my SQL statement above to add:</p>

<pre><code>...
AND CRT_DTTM &lt; SYSDATE - INTERVAL '10' MINUTE
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The Question:</strong></p>

<p>What I want to know is if there's a way to examine the rows already inserted into the table to find those pockets where the identity is out of order with the timestamp:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/yRbdd.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/yRbdd.png"" alt=""database sequence vs timestamp""></a>
</p>

<p>I want to find the pockets of data with this situation to know if 10 minutes is long enough to hold off on looking at the timestamp.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM V_TRANS t1
JOIN V_TRANS t2
    ON t1.trans_id &lt; t2.trans_id
        AND t2.crt_dttm &lt; t1.crt_dttm

"2166050","<p>Given this table:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/pzNJA.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>How can I get the datediff in days between each status_date for each group of ID_Number?  In other words I need to find the number of elapsed days for each status that the ID_Number has been given.</p>

<p>Some things to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>All ID_Number will have a received_date which should be the earliest date for each ID_Number (but app doesn't enforce)</li>
<li>For each ID_Number there will be a status with a corresponding status_date which is the date that the ID_Number was given that particular status.</li>
<li>The status column doesn't always necessarily go in the same order every time (app doesn't enforce)</li>
<li>All ID_Number will have a closed_date which should be the latest date (but app doesn't enforce)</li>
</ul>

<p>Sample output:
So for ID_Number 2001, the first date (received_date) is 2009-05-02 and the next date you encounter has a status of 'open' and is 2009-05-02 so elapsed days is 0.  Moving on to the next date encountered is 2009-05-10 with a status of 'invest' and the elapsed days is 8 counting from the prior date.  The next date encountered is 2009-07-11 and the elapsed days is 62 counting from the previous date. </p>

<p><strong>Edited to add:</strong></p>

<p>Is it possible to have the elapsed days end up as a column on this table/view?
I also forgot to add that this is SQL Server 2000.</p>

"2166074","<p>Suppose I have this HTML structure:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""a""&gt;
 &lt;div class=""floated-left""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
 &lt;div class=""floated-left""&gt;...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have noticed that if I don't set <code>overflow:hidden</code> to <code>.a</code>, then the <code>&lt;div class=""a""&gt;</code> does not occupy any vertical size. For example, if I set its background to red, it is not visible at all. Inspecting it with FireBug shows that it's there but of almost no vertical size.</p>

<p>To fix this, I found that I have to set <code>overflow:hidden</code> to <code>.a</code>. Then the first <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> goes over all its content.</p>

<p>Here is a real example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;style&gt;
    .a { background-color: red; }
    .b { background-color: red; overflow: hidden }
    .floated-left { float: left; width: 100px; height: 100px; background-color: blue; }
  &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;div with class a, that doesn't overflow:hidden:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class=""a""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""floated-left""&gt;Hi,&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""floated-left""&gt;Mom!&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;div style=""clear:both""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;div with class b, that does overflow:hidden:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class=""b""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""floated-left""&gt;Hi,&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""floated-left""&gt;Dad!&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how <code>Hi, Mom!</code> does not get red background (no overflow:hidden), while <code>Hi, Dad!</code> does get red background (has overflow:hidden).</p>

<p>Can anyone explain this behaviour?</p>

<p>Here is screenshot of the example:</p>

","When should overflow:hidden be used for a <div>?","<html><css>","2010-01-29 23:47:00","702","2166097","4","<p>When you float elements they are taken out of the document flow. Among other things, this means that they have no impact on the dimensions of the parent element (although its width will determine where the floats are positioned on the horizontal axis). They do however impact positioning of siblings within the container depending on whether those sibling are inline or block level elements and whether they have width or not.</p>

<p>In order to make the height of the floats impact the height of the container you must have an element after them that clears them. However, what you are seeing here is actually a part of the CSS standard that you can use to clear floats without additional, non-semantic markup. The only issue is this behavior can vary slightly in older browsers and their css implementations. This effect is present with both overflow auto and overflow hidden but does not present with overflow visible. In IE &lt; 6 you must have a width set on the containing element for it to work.</p>

"2167283","<p>As far as I understand the serial port so far, transferring data is done over pin 3. As shown here:
<img src=""https://jan.newmarch.name/internetdevices/embedded/9_PIN_PIN_OUT.GIF"" alt=""Serial Port Pinout""></p>

<p>There are two things that make me uncomfortable about this. The first is that it seems to imply that the two connected devices agree on a signal speed and the second is that even if they are configured to run at the same speed you run into possible synchronization issues... right? Such things can be handled I suppose but it seems like there must be a simpler method.</p>

<p>What seems like a better approach to me would be to have one of the serial port pins send a pulse that indicates that the next bit is ready to be stored. So if we're hooking these pins up to a shift register we basically have: (some pulse pin)->clk, tx->d</p>

<p>Is this a common practice? Is there some reason not to do this?</p>

<p><em>EDIT</em> </p>

<p>Mike shouldn't have deleted his answer. This <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2C#Timing_diagram"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">I<sup>2</sup>C (2 pin serial)</a> approach seems fairly close to what I did. The serial port doesn't have a clock you're right nobugz but that's basically what I've done. See here:</p>

<pre><code>private void SendBytes(byte[] data)
{
    int baudRate = 0;
    int byteToSend = 0;
    int bitToSend = 0;
    byte bitmask = 0;

    byte[] trigger = new byte[1];
    trigger[0] = 0;

    SerialPort p;
    try
    {
        p = new SerialPort(cmbPorts.Text);
    }
    catch
    {
        return;
    }

    if (!int.TryParse(txtBaudRate.Text, out baudRate)) return;
    if (baudRate &lt; 100) return;
    p.BaudRate = baudRate;

    for (int index = 0; index &lt; data.Length * 8; index++)
    {
        byteToSend = (int)(index / 8);
        bitToSend = index - (byteToSend * 8);
        bitmask = (byte)System.Math.Pow(2, bitToSend);

        p.Open();
        p.Parity = Parity.Space;
        p.RtsEnable = (byte)(data[byteToSend] &amp; bitmask) &gt; 0;

        s = p.BaseStream;
        s.WriteByte(trigger[0]);

        p.Close();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Before anyone tells me how ugly this is or how I'm destroying my transfer speeds my quick answer is I don't care about that. My point is this seems much much simpler than the method you described in your answer nobugz. And it wouldn't be as ugly if the .Net SerialPort class gave me more control over the pin signals. Are there other serial port APIs that do?</p>

<p>The base color, in this case a white background.</p>

<p>The shadow.</p>

<p>The shape casting the shadow.  This is made by finding the bounding box of the inner shape, expanding that box by more than the width of the shadow, then cutting a hole in the box with the inner shape.</p>

<p>Clipping these with the inner shape.  </p>

<p>Then finally drawing the surrounding colored shape, in this case a rectangle with the inner shape cut out.  </p>

<p>Note: Depending upon the expected look, the shape casting the shadow may or may not be the same shape filling the foreground color.  A thin section between the inner shape and the outer shape would cast a reduced shadow.  If that effect is not desired, a larger outer shape would be required to get the consistent inner shadow.  Also, the explicit clipping of the shadow is required in case the shadow extends beyond the outer shape.</p>

<p>To draw a shape with a hole in the middle, like this example shape, you'll want to draw a path with two subpaths.  One subpath would be the outer box, and the other would be the inner irregular shape.  If you're using the default nonzero winding number rule, you'll want to specify the points for the outer box in the opposite direction than the inner irregular shape.  For example, specifying the outer box's points in clockwise order would require specifying the inner shape's points in counter-clockwise order.

<p>If all the boxes' widths fit evenly into the container (say, they are each 100px and the container is 300px wide) then they will stack up next to each other until they reach the bounds of their container, and then wrap left and stack again.</p>

  support the interface, so you could use them as DataSources.Other classes only support the IEnumerable interface. This allows them
  to be used as a DataSource but not as a paged data source.

<li>making a component - is it okay to build components that rely on controllers?</li>

HAL is a kernel-mode abstraction layer that WDDM uses. In turn, the DirectX API talks to the WDDM driver (written by nVidia, ATi, etc), and instantiates a HAL device.  </p>

<p>For software to talk to HAL, it needs to run in privileged mode (i.e. be a driver). If you're curious, this is where HAL is specified: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa490448.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa490448.aspx</a>  </p>

"2182334","<p>I decided to delete a few branches from a (personal project) repository of mine that were merged into <code>master</code> after confirming on #git that leftover branches aren't really necessary.</p>

<p>However, gitk's visualisation of my repository's history as a result has been completely screwed up.</p>

<p>Basically something like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/3GkpX.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/3GkpX.png"" alt=""http://i48.tinypic.com/90r512.png""></a>
</p>

<p>With those branches from commits appearing out of nowhere eventually going back into some other commits up ahead. A merge did not occur at all of the points, and I only had around 5 extra branches.</p>

<p>Is this normal? Is there any fix for this?</p>
","Deleting branches in git causes gitk to go wild","<git><gitk>","2010-02-02 06:55:35","469","2185208","3","<p>Have you tried reloading your display? Sometimes gitk gets a bit confused, but quitting and restarting it, or reloading (<strong>File</strong> > <strong>Reload</strong>, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>F5</kbd>) can help it re-draw the history in a more friendly fashion.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong>: Now that I see the repository, I can see what's going on.</p>

<p>It looks like you did some development on master, while also working on some side branches. While you were doing this, you merged <code>master</code> into those side branches several times. <code>gitk</code> displays commits in a list, so it needs a linear ordering of commits. Whenever you have branching history, there are several possible linear orderings you can put that history in. For instance, the following structure:</p>

<pre><code>       /-- c -- e --\
a -- b               g -- h
       \-- d -- f --/
</code></pre>

<p>Could be ordered an any of the following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>a, b, c, e, d, f, g, h</li>
<li>a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h</li>
<li>a, b, c, d, f, e, g, h</li>
<li>a, b, d, c, e, f, g, h</li>
<li>a, b, d, c, f, e, g, h</li>
<li>a, b, d, f, c, e, g, h</li>
</ol>

<p>By default, <code>gitk</code> uses a topological ordering, which tries to group together commits on each branch, so you can see a logical progression of commits for each branch, rather than commits of each side of the branch interspersed based on when they happened. So, for instance, it might display them in ordering (1):</p>

<pre><code>a -- b -- c -- e ------------ g -- h
       \----------- d -- f --/
</code></pre>

<p>This ordering works fine if you're just looking at a linear log, and also works fine in <code>gitk</code> if you don't merge between the branches very often (as in the example given). But if you do what you did, merging <code>master</code> into the topic branches frequently, then this produces the kind of mess that you're seeing; the commits on <code>master</code> are shown first, then the commits on the side branches, but the frequent merging of <code>master</code> into the side branches become the long connections that pile up and make the history look confusing. (Note that Git doesn't actually store which commits came from which branch, but the way it sorts them it winds up keeping the commits from each branch together, it appears).</p>

<p>The easiest way to deal with this that I know of is just to display commits in <code>gitk</code> in chronological order. Open <strong>View</strong> > <strong>Edit view...</strong>, and check the <strong>Strictly sort by date</strong> option. Now you should see your history displayed much more sanely. To launch directly into this view, you can pass the <code>--date-order</code> option into <code>gitk</code>.</p>

&lt;h:panelGroup id=""leftcol"" layout=""block""&gt;&lt;/h:panelGroup&gt;

"2189671","<p>I am trying to figure out how to bind a WPF DataGrid's column header and main data to a data source using an MVVM pattern. The result I'm looking for would look like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/iieVg.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/iieVg.png"" alt=""alt text""></a><br>
<sub>(source: <a href=""http://brian.vallelunga.com/files/datagrid-custom-headers.PNG"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">vallelunga.com</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>I've successfully styled the headers here, but I'm unsure how to bind the values in the headers. Specifically, the IsChecked property of the check-box, the selected index of the combo box and the value of the text box.</p>

<p>I was previously using a simple DataTable to populate the main grid data, but I'm going to need something more complex to hold both the grid data and the values for each column. Or perhaps I can store them as separate entities entirely.</p>

<p>So, does anyone have any idea of how I might pull off this binding? One limitation is that the columns must be auto-generated since I have no idea what they will be until runtime. The application simply loads the data form an Excel spreadsheet and there may be any number of columns present.</p>

","WPF Datagrid binding custom column headers","<wpf><datagrid><binding><wpfdatagrid><columnheader>","2010-02-03 04:20:17","19691","2229902","3","<p>Here's what I ended up doing to use this with the MVVM pattern:</p>

<p>I have two sets of data for binding on my view model: one for the actual grid data and one for the column headers. Currently these are exposed as two properties:</p>

<pre><code>// INotifyPropertyChanged support not shown for brevity
public DataTable GridData { get; set; } 
public BindingList&lt;ImportColumnInfo&gt; ColumnData { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>The trick to working with two differing sets of data is in the grid. I have subclassed the DataGrid and given the grid an additional data source called ColumnSource, as a dependency property. This is what is bound to the ColumnData on my view model. I then set the header of each auto-generated column to the appropriately indexed data in the ColumnSource data source. The code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public class ImporterDataGrid : DataGrid
{
    protected override void OnAutoGeneratingColumn(DataGridAutoGeneratingColumnEventArgs e)
    {
        base.OnAutoGeneratingColumn(e);

        int columnIndex = this.Columns.Count;
        var column = new ImporterDataGridColumn();
        column.Header = ColumnSource[columnIndex];
        column.Binding = new Binding(e.PropertyName) { Mode = BindingMode.OneWay };
        e.Column = column;
    }

    public IList ColumnSource
    {
        get { return (IList)GetValue(ColumnSourceProperty); }
        set { SetValue(ColumnSourceProperty, value); }
    }

    public static readonly DependencyProperty ColumnSourceProperty = DependencyProperty.Register(""ColumnSource"", typeof(IList), typeof(ImporterDataGrid), new FrameworkPropertyMetadata(null));

}
</code></pre>

<p>I can now perform normal data binding in the templated header of my columns, which will all bind against the data in the ColumnData property of my view model.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I was asked to show the XAML for my grid. It's really basic, but here it is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Controls:ImporterDataGrid

<li>Product (prodId <code>key</code>, catId, createdOn)</li>

<p>There's a reason for having a separate Category_Hierarchy table, because I'm using triggers on Category table that populate it, because MySql triggers work as they do and I can't populate columns on the same table inside triggers if I would like to use <code>auto_increment</code> values.

<p>Category_Hierarchy makes it simple to get category subordinate trees like this:</p>

<pre><code>select c.*
from Category c
    join Category_Hierarchy h
    on (h.catId = c.catId)
where h.parentTrail like '1/2/3/%'
</code></pre>

<p>Which would return complete subordinate tree of category 3 (that is below 2, that is below 1 which is root category) including subordinate tree root node. Excluding root node is just one more <code>where</code> condition.</p>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>I would like to write a stored procedure:</p>

<pre><code>create procedure GetLatestProductsFromSubCategories(in catId int)
begin
    /* return 10 latest products from each */
    /* catId subcategory subordinate tree  */
end;
</code></pre>

<p>This means if a certain category had 3 direct sub categories (with whatever number of nodes underneath) I would get 30 results (10 from each subordinate tree). If it had 5 sub categories I'd get 50 results.</p>

<p><strong>What would be the best/fastest/most efficient way to do this?</strong> If possible I'd like to avoid cursors unless they'd work faster compared to any other solution as well as prepared statements, because this would be one of the most frequent calls to DB.</p>

<h2>Edit</h2>

<p>Since a picture tells 1000 words I'll try to better explain what I want using an image. Below image shows category tree. <strong>Each of these nodes</strong> can have an arbitrary number of products related to them. Products are not included in the picture.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/jKZ90.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/jKZ90.jpg"" alt=""category tree""></a>
</p>

<p>So if I'd execute this call:</p>

<pre><code>call GetLatestProductsFromSubCategories(1);
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to effectively get 30 products:</p>

<ul>
<li>10 latest products from the whole orange subtree</li>
<li>10 latest products from the whole blue subtree and</li>
<li>10 latest products from the whole green subtree</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't want to get 10 latest products from each node under <code>catId=1</code> node which would mean 320 products.</p>

"2197351","<p>While debugging my application with Delphi 2009, I sometimes get the following exception occurring:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/GSJuC.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/GSJuC.gif"" alt=""What is this?""></a><br>
<sub>(source: <a href=""http://www.beholdgenealogy.com/img/ideexception.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">beholdgenealogy.com</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>This only happens occasionally, but after pressing OK, then my IDE and program both may freeze. If I am lucky I can sometimes do a File/SaveAll in Delphi, but sometimes I can't. Either way I am stuck and then the only thing I can do is use Windows Task Manager to shut down Delphi. Of course, if I was unable to SaveAll, then I lose all the edits I had made since last saving.</p>

<p>I have all the Delphi 2009 Updates installed right up to and including Update 4. I also have IDE Fix Pack 2009 2.9 installed.</p>

<p>The Error is trapped for me by EurekaLog, and the error report gives the following call stack:</p>

<p>As you can see, all of the call stack is in Delphi and Windows. It does not connect back at all to any line in my program.</p>

<p>I have looked at the webpage: <a href=""http://www.audacia-software.de/de/bcb/external-exception-eefface.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">External Exception EEFFACE</a> and translated it from German to English, but it appears to be talking about Delphi C++ whereas I don't use C++ at all.</p>

<p>My problem is I have no idea what might be causing this as it does not happen consistently. I have no idea even where to look to find it or how to track it down.</p>

<p>Does someone know what this is and how I can track it down or at least prevent it from happening?</p>

<p>Alex of EurekaLog posted this in response to <a href=""http://news.eurekalog.com/showthread.php?t=2608"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my query on their forum</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think it may be a bug in Delphi's

  evaluation tooltips or something
  similar.</p>
  
  <p>See for yourself - we have an C++
  exception in system module (EEFFACE is
  a special code for VCL exception. When
  VCL encounters an unknown C++

  EExternalException object with code =

<p>Hopefully with this information, Embarcadero will be able to prevent this in future releases.</p>

<hr>

<p>I come back to this question over 4 years later, and realize that a few months ago, I found the solution, so I am posting it here for anyone else who may encounter this.</p>

<p>The problem and solution were provided in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/99158/olaf-monien"">Olaf Monien</a>'s blog, in a post from 2009/07/22 titled Delphi 2009 / Windows 7 / 64 bit Debugger Crash Workaround. </p>

<p>Olaf's instructions on that post worked perfectly for me, and the problem is gone. I thanked him in a comment on his blog post.</p>

<p>As @rossmcm points out in his comment, Olaf's blog post is no longer there, but <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20141027020450/http://www.monien.net/delphi-2009-windows-7-64-bit-debugger-crash-workaround"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the post can still be found on the Internet Archive</a>.

<p><em>convertToList</em>: converts an adjacency matrix into an adjacency list.</p>

<p><em>printList</em>: traverses the adjacency matrix and prints a message for every edge.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Some edges are being duplicated.  I'm not sure if it is a problem when I create the array of lists or when I traverse the adjacency matrix to print it.  Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Below is a picture of the program output for 5 vertices with edges (0, 1) and (3, 2).  The matrix is correct.  The adjacency list is not. Edges (0, 1), (1, 1) and (2, 3) should not be repeated.</p>

<pre><code>void printList (link * a, int size)

    {
        for (link finger = a[i]; finger != NULL; finger = finger-&gt;next)

        }

} // end function print

<p>And I think your problem with the adjacency lists is that this code:</p>

<pre><code>for (int j = i; j &lt; size; j++)
{
    if (b[i][j] == 1) // if an edge exists on the matrix
    { // create the edges on the adjacency list
        a[j] = new node(i, a[j]);
        a[i] = new node(j, a[i]);
    }

<p>should be this:</p>

<pre><code>for (int j = 0; j &lt; size; j++)
{
    if (b[i][j] == 1) // if an edge exists on the matrix
    { // create the edges on the adjacency list
        a[i] = new node(j, a[i]);
    }

"2200236","<p>Last night I was trying to solve <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/problem=15"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">challenge #15 from Project Euler</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starting in the top left corner of a
  2×2 grid, there are 6 routes (without
  backtracking) to the bottom right
  corner.</p>
  
  <p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/njLFK.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/njLFK.gif"" alt=""alt text""></a><br>
  <sub>(source: <a href=""http://projecteuler.net/project/images/p_015.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">projecteuler.net</a>)</sub>  </p>
  
  <p>How many routes are there through a
  20×20 grid?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I figured this shouldn't be so hard, so I wrote a basic recursive function:</p>

<pre><code>const int gridSize = 20;

// call with progress(0, 0)
static int progress(int x, int y)
{
    int i = 0;

    if (x &lt; gridSize)
        i += progress(x + 1, y);
    if (y &lt; gridSize)
        i += progress(x, y + 1);

    if (x == gridSize &amp;&amp; y == gridSize)
        return 1;

    return i;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I verified that it worked for a smaller grids such as 2×2 or 3×3, and then set it to run for a 20×20 grid. Imagine my surprise when, 5 hours later, the program was still happily crunching the numbers, and only about 80% done (based on examining its current position/route in the grid).</p>

<p>Clearly I'm going about this the wrong way. How would you solve this problem? I'm thinking it should be solved using an equation rather than a method like mine, but that's unfortunately not a strong side of mine.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>:</p>

<p>I now have a working version. Basically it caches results obtained before when a n×m block still remains to be traversed. Here is the code along with some comments:</p>

<pre><code>// the size of our grid
static int gridSize = 20;

// the amount of paths available for a ""NxM"" block, e.g. ""2x2"" =&gt; 4
static Dictionary&lt;string, long&gt; pathsByBlock = new Dictionary&lt;string, long&gt;();

// calculate the surface of the block to the finish line
static long calcsurface(long x, long y)
{
    return (gridSize - x) * (gridSize - y);
}

// call using progress (0, 0)
static long progress(long x, long y)
{
    // first calculate the surface of the block remaining
    long surface = calcsurface(x, y);
    long i = 0;

    // zero surface means only 1 path remains
    // (we either go only right, or only down)
    if (surface == 0)
        return 1;

    // create a textual representation of the remaining
    // block, for use in the dictionary
    string block = (gridSize - x) + ""x"" + (gridSize - y);

    // if a same block has not been processed before
    if (!pathsByBlock.ContainsKey(block))
    {
        // calculate it in the right direction
        if (x &lt; gridSize)
            i += progress(x + 1, y);
        // and in the down direction
        if (y &lt; gridSize)
            i += progress(x, y + 1);

        // and cache the result!
        pathsByBlock[block] = i;
    }

    // self-explanatory :)
    return pathsByBlock[block];
}

<p><b>Bonus update</b>:</p>

<p>After reading Eric Lippert's answer, I took another look and rewrote it somewhat. The basic idea is still the same but the caching part has been taken out and put in a separate function, like in Eric's example. The result is some much more elegant looking code.</p>

{
    // Return a function which is f with caching.
    var dictionary = new Dictionary&lt;string, R&gt;();
    return (A1 a1, A2 a2) =&gt;
    {
        R r;
        string key = a1 + ""x"" + a2;
        if (!dictionary.TryGetValue(key, out r))
        {
            // not in cache yet
            r = f(a1, a2);
            dictionary.Add(key, r);
        }
        return r;
    };
}

// calculate the surface of the block to the finish line
static long calcsurface(long x, long y)
{
    return (gridSize - x) * (gridSize - y);
}

// call using progress (0, 0)
static Func&lt;long, long, long&gt; progress = ((Func&lt;long, long, long&gt;)((long x, long y) =&gt;
{
    // first calculate the surface of the block remaining
    long surface = calcsurface(x, y);
    long i = 0;

    // zero surface means only 1 path remains
    // (we either go only right, or only down)
    if (surface == 0)
        return 1;

    // calculate it in the right direction
    if (x &lt; gridSize)
        i += progress(x + 1, y);
    // and in the down direction
    if (y &lt; gridSize)

    // self-explanatory :)
    return i;

<p>By the way, I couldn't think of a better way to use the two arguments as a key for the dictionary. I googled around a bit, and it seems this is a common solution. Oh well.</p>

<p>In the LogSearchesDimensions table, I could have multiple records for County_ID (LogSearchDimension_id 5) if the user searched for more than one county in a single search. Let's assume the user searched in counties 5, 6, 7, 12, and 15. When I'm running a report, this single search would need to show up in the reports for all 5 counties that were searched. If I ran a report that combined counties 5 and 6, then it should only show once.</p>

<p>I know this is a lot of information, and probably still not enough, but I'm hoping someone who's done similar could share some tips for making this type of filter work with some degree of speed.</p>

<p>I currently have a very complicated query, with all sorts of joins and having conditions to try and find searches with the proper number of matches, but it's not performing well at all. I've attached a diagram of the tables to show the relationships.<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/K2o5B.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/K2o5B.png"" alt=""alt text""></a><br>

<h2>Principal Observaton And Recommendation:</h2>

<p>It appears that </p>

<ol>
<li>this is a Data Warehouse (everything presented is consistent with a DW), and </li>
<li>it has been implemented in a SQL Server OLTP database.  </li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, the best thing you could do would be to :</p>

<h3>0. Re-implement it in a SQL Server OLAP Database:</h3>

<p>OLAP databases (or Analysis Services or SSAS) are much better suited for this kind of application and much better optimized for this kind of query.  However, on the assumption that this would be far beyond the scope of your current intentions, I will proceed with lower impact recommendations.</p>

<h2>Preliminary Observations and Recommendations:</h2>

<p><em>these are necessarily preliminary as real performance analysis cannot be done on something this complex without at least an estimated query plan.  In particular, although recommendations for <strong>possible</strong> improvements can be made, without the real data, or query plans based on the real data, it is impossible to tell which changes will actually make any real difference in performance.</em></p>

<p>The basic problem that I see is that this very complex query is doing a lot of full-table scans and because of its complexity is almost effectively <em>forcing</em> these scans.  Table scans can be very expensive, especially on large tables.  However, if there is no effective way for SQL to pre-filter a table (that is, to eliminate 99% of the records via a test that does not require a join and can be applied to an index), then that is the most efficient choice that it has left.  In that light, the following recommendations look at ways to remedy that situation:</p>

<h3>A. Make a SARGable [Created] column on the [vwLogSearchesCounty] View.</h3>

<p>Currently the [vwLogSearchesCounty] View defines its [Created] column like this:</p>

<pre><code>CAST(FLOOR(CAST(dbo.LogSearches.Created AS FLOAT)) AS DATETIME) AS Created
</code></pre>

<p>The apparent reason for this is to allow the use of the BETWEEN operator on this column when searching for Date Ranges, without have to worry about the problems of time-of-day mismatches.  However this has the side-effect of making this column non-SARGable, that is, not searchable via an index (""SARG"" = ""Search ARGument"").  As the searches on this column are one of the few globally-fixed constraints (that is, something that can be searched on <em>before</em> doing joins) making it SARGable is one of your best oppurtunities for speeding up your queries.</p>

<p>To make it SARGable, you need to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Either remove the CAST(FLOOR(CAST(..))) function from the [Created] column or add a second column to the view without them (I will assume the later) like this:</p>

<pre><code>dbo.LogSearches.Created AS CreatedTime
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Change the Date-Range search in the view, as below, from</p>

<pre><code>AND v.Created BETWEEN @LowDate AND @HighDate
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>AND v.CreatedTime &gt;= @LowDate AND v.CreatedTime &lt; dateadd(dd,1,@HighDate)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Make sure that there is an Index on the original [Created] column.  A clustered index would be best:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_LogSearches_Created ON [dbo].[LogSearches] (Created)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>(for more on correctly searching for dates and date ranges in SQL Server see here: <a href=""http://www.sqlservercentral.com/Forums/Topic438717-338-1.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.sqlservercentral.com/Forums/Topic438717-338-1.aspx</a>)</p>

<h3>B. Make [LogSearchDimension_ID] column in the [LogSearchesDimensions] table Indexed.</h3>

<p>I do not know if this column is already indexed, but it should be as it is another of the very few globally-fixed constraints.  Again, a clustered index would be best:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_LogSearchesDimensions_11 ON [dbo].[LogSearchesDimensions] ([LogSearchDimension_ID])
</code></pre>

<h3>C. Make [State_code] column on the [State] table Indexed.</h3>

<p>Like (B) above, it may not be indexed, but your query would probably benefit if it was.</p>

<h3>D.  Eliminate the explicit [County] and [State] tables from your query.</h3>

<p>It appears that the only reason that you are explicitly joining the [County] and [State] tables in your query is to get the [State_Code] column from the [State] table that is not included in the [vwLogSearchesCounty] view.  Ideally, the optimizer would figure out that it could merge these two references to the [State] and [County] tables together and you could pick up that column for free.  Unfortunately the optimizer often misses such things on more complex queries, and on my server it appears to be doing double work for this field.</p>

<p>The best solution would be to just add the [State_code] column to the view and then eliminate the explicit [county] and [State] joins in your query.  this additional colum should <em>not</em> affect the performance of any other queries that use the view but do not use this column (SQL Server 2005 and above).</p>

<p><strong><em>If you implement all four of these recommendations (including the CLUSTERED part) you should be able to elminate the table scans.  At this time I see no other reasonable way to do so.</em></strong></p>

<p><H2>More Desparate Recommendation:</h2></p>

<p>If all of this should fail to help you, I can only see one other relatively low-cost option, which is to turn your View [vwLogSearchesCounty], into an Indexed View.  In particular, the Indexes that I mentioned above on [State_Code] and [Created]/[CreatedTime] should be reimplemented on the View (as well as any other important ones).</p>

<p>This has the effect, not only of indexing important fields, but also of pre-aggregating the View and automatically maintaining that pre-aggregation.  This also means that it will take up storage space, so if this view has a very large number of rows, that may be an issue for you.</p>

"2201302","<p>We use a DHTML calendar picker that only allows you to change the date, which is desired functionality. However, I need to figure out the javascript to change the date next to the calendar picker, as seen in the image below, and popup an ""are you sure"" message.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/q95bT.jpg"" alt=""date example""></p>

<p>The above image is one row in a table, so the JS needs to be aware of which one of potentially 10+ dates it should be editing.</p>

<p>I'm a bit of a javascript n00b. Still learning new things. Feel free to link me to things to read and tips/hints/etc.</p>

<p>If it helps any, we're using PERL with CGI. I guess the JS will have to have an AJAX call to update the database, which I can figure out from other examples in the code base. I just need to figure out how to edit the date on the page for now.</p>

<p>And for clarification, the process is... the person clicks on that calendar icon, gets a DHTML date picker, chooses a date, confirms he wants to change datetime1 to datetime2, and then the change gets applied to the text you see next to the calendar icon and gets put in the database.</p>
","How do I make my popup date picker calendar javascript change the text date next to it and update the database?","<javascript><ajax><perl><datepicker>","2010-02-04 16:27:57","1528","2201716","1","<p>Having the actual web page (HTML &amp; JS) would really help here.  But, in general, you'll need a way for the JS to ""address"" the text you'd like to change.  The easiest way I know is to wrap the text in a DIV or SPAN, with a unique ID (""datetime1"", ""datetime2"", etc.).</p>

<p>Then, assuming you know which piece of JS is being called when the datepicker runs, access the text item like:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById('datetime1').innerHTML = (insert new datetime here);
</code></pre>

<p>You'll need a way to pass the ID (datetime1, etc) to the JS, but that should be easy if Perl is generating the 10 datetime rows (i.e., the FOR loop in Perl just sticks in sequential IDs into the DIV/SPANs and again as arguments to the datepicker function).</p>

<p>I assume you know (or can find) how to do ""alert()"" in JS, so the confirmation should be the easiest part.</p>

<p>It also sounds like you need to send the new dates back into some DB.  I suggest a FORM to send it all back to the Perl CGI, which will have to update the DB.  Folks more clever than me might be able to tell you how to do that in JS w/ AJAX, etc.</p>

"2202977","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>How do I make it easy for non-programmers to write a query such as the following?</p>

<pre><code>select
    table_name.*
  , foreign_table_1.name
  , foreign_table_2.name
from
  table_name
left outer join foreign_table foreign_table_1 on foreign_table_1.id = foreign_1_id
left outer join foreign_table foreign_table_2 on foreign_table_2.id = foreign_1_id
;
</code></pre>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>I have a situation like this:</p>

<pre><code>create table table_name (
    id integer primary key autoincrement not null
  , foreign_key_1_id integer not null
  , foreign_key_2_id integer not null
  , some_other_column varchar(255) null
);

create table foreign_table (
    id integer primary key autoincrement not null
  , name varchar(255) null
);
</code></pre>

<p>...in which both <code>foreign_key_1_id</code> and <code>foreign_key_2_id</code> reference <code>foreign_table</code>.  (Obviously, this is simplified and abstracted.)  To query and get the respective values, I might do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>select
    table_name.*
  , foreign_table_1.name
  , foreign_table_2.name
from
  table_name
left outer join foreign_table foreign_table_1 on foreign_table_1.id = foreign_1_id
left outer join foreign_table foreign_table_2 on foreign_table_2.id = foreign_1_id
;
</code></pre>

<p>(That is, alias <code>foreign_table</code> in the join to link things up correctly.)  This works fine.  However, some of my clients want to use <a href=""http://www.sqlmaestro.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""SQL Maestro"">SQL Maestro</a> to query the tables.  This program uses the foreign key information to link up tables using a fairly straightforward interface (""Visual Query Builder"").  For instance, the user can pick multiple tables and SQL Maestro will fill in the joins, like seen here:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/IMila.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/IMila.png"" alt=""Visual Query Builder""></a><br>
<sub>(source: <a href=""http://sqlmaestro.com/data/912/1183273856-250x238.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sqlmaestro.com</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>(That's a diagram from their website, just for illustration.)</p>

<p>This strategy works great as long as foreign keys only reference one table.  The multiple-reference situation seems to be confusing it because it gneerates SQL like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  table_name.some_other_column,
  foreign_table.name
FROM
  table_name
  INNER JOIN foreign_table ON (table_name.foreign_key_1_id = foreign_table.id)
  AND (table_name.foreign_key_2_id = foreign_table.id)
</code></pre>

<p>...because the foreign keys are defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code>create table table_name (
    id integer primary key autoincrement not null
  , foreign_key_1_id integer not null
  , foreign_key_2_id integer not null
  , some_other_column varchar(255) null

  ---------------------------
  -- The part that changed:
  ---------------------------
  , foreign key (foreign_key_1_id) references foreign_table(id)
  , foreign key (foreign_key_2_id) references foreign_table(id)
);

create table foreign_table (
    id integer primary key autoincrement not null
  , name varchar(255) not null
);
</code></pre>

<p>That's a problem because you only get 1 <code>foreign_table.name</code> value back, whereas there are often 2 separate values.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>How would I go about defining foreign keys to handle this situation?  (Is it possible or does it make sense to do so?  I wouldn't think that it would make a big difference in constraint checking, so I've thought that that is a reason I can't find any information.)  My end goal is to make querying this information easy for my clients to do by themselves, and although this situation doesn't happen every day, it's time-consuming / frustrating to have to help people through it every time it comes up.</p>

<p>If there isn't a way of solving my foreign key problem this way, can you suggest any alternatives?  I already have some ways of getting people this information though views, but people often need to have more flexibility than that.</p>

<p>I am generating some PDFs with dompdf, which contains some text and images in a table. But if the text has a large URL in it, the URL wraps all the way to the end of the line. All the text and URL are wrapped in a div with fixed width and height, yet the URL still overflows.</p>

<p>The same HTML rendered in the browser seems to be OK.</p>

<p>Any thoughts?  </p>
","Text overflowing tables when generating PDF with dompdf","<html><pdf><dompdf><word-wrap>","2010-02-05 04:39:07","6576","2345269","2","<p>I believe DOMPDF is using a fairly limited character set for determining how to split a line. Right now it only splits a line at a dash or a space. So something like the URL you have in your sample is going to run past the width of the container. DOMPDF just doesn't know how to break it up.</p>

<p>Starting with dompdf v0.6.0 you can style your text so that words are broken at any character, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span style=""word-wrap: break-word;""&gt;http://example.com/really/long/.../url&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It's not as clean as breaking on a particular character (e.g. a <code>/</code>). If you're comfortable hacking the code you can work around the problem a little more elegantly. Open up the text reflower class and modify the regular expression that splits the line. The regular expression looks like the following:</p>

<pre><code>preg_split('/([\s-]+)/u', $text, -1, PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE)
</code></pre>

<p>Modify that code to include whatever extra characters you think will make for a good line break. You might, for example, break URLs up on ?, &amp;, or even / if you expect to have extremely long URLs in your text:</p>

<pre><code>$words = preg_split('/([\s-\?\&amp;\/]+)/u', $text, -1, PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE);
</code></pre>

<p>In dompdf 0.6.1 the RegEx can be found in dompdf/include/text_frame_reflower.cls.php lines 86 and 371. In the upcoming 0.7.0 the RegEx can be found in dompdf/src/FrameReflower/Text.php lines 106 and 402.</p>

<p>The drawback to modifying the RegEx is that this will affect all text (not just URLs).</p>

        $result .= $charset[$i % 2][array_rand($charset[$i % 2])];
    }

    return $result;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically this generates a string with <code>$mnemonic</code> length where every odd character is a consonant and every even character is a vowel. While I understand this reduces the password complexity it's usually much more <strong>easier to remember</strong>. Now I want to improve it by generating strings that are <strong>easy to type</strong>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Qwerty.svg/640px-Qwerty.svg.png"" alt=""QWERTY Keyboard Layout""></p>

<p>For instance, while a *nix newbie I always prefer RHEL based distributions over Debian ones, the main reason is the ease of typing <code>yum</code> versus the ease of typing <code>apt[-get]</code>, just try it for yourself.</p>

<p>How should I implement the logic to generate strings that are easy to type on QWERTY keyboards?</p>
","Mnemonic Password Generation Algorithm for QWERTY Keyboards","<php><algorithm><string><keyboard><qwerty>","2010-02-05 17:31:31","3860","2258231","8","<p>You may wanna take a look at the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard#Overview"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">principles used in the Dvorak keyboard</a>,</p>

<p>Those principles applied in a password-generating algorithm would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Letters should be typed by altering hands.</li>
<li>Use easy to type combinations. Take a look at the Dvorak layout and see the common digraphs and the positions of their letters.</li>
<li>Use only one letter from the bottom row, or not. Make it random!</li>
<li>You can make the ratio 2 to 1 (2 letters typed by the right hand to 1 letter typed by the left hand).</li>
<li>Since the ratio is 2 to 1, you're gonna have 2 consecutive letters typed by the same hand so you're gonna have to make sure they are typed from the outside of the keyboard to the inside. This principle is applied to the digraphs.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know you said it's a QWERTY keyboard but using these principles on a QWERTY keyboard can give you some very good results, like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ktrd,ogkdo (""typewriter"" in dvorak)</p>
  
  <p>kjg;g;akd;k (using only the home row)</p>
  
  <p>pjedoildupsk (just a random password following the principles)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All Dvorak haters, shush it!</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I'm creating a tabbed navigation from an XML file. However for some reason my loop only creates textfields for the active tab and the last tab <em>(in this case the 4th tab).</em>
<br/><br/></p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://leongaban.com/stackoverflow/RTMP/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">> You can preview my Flash here. &lt;</a></strong> (I turned textfield borders on)
<br/><br/></p>

<p>My Issues:<br/>
<strong>1.</strong> The Active Tab (light colored tab) does not size correctly based on the width of the textfield<br/>
<strong>2.</strong> My loop for some reason skips the 2 middle tabs, but correctly sets the 4th tab.
<br/><br/></p>

<h2>XML Tab titles:</h2>

<ul>
<li>This is first tab<br/></li>
<li>2nd Tab<br/></li>
<li>The 3rd Tab<br/></li>
<li>The 4th and last tab
<br/></li>
</ul>

<p>It seems that the 2nd and 3rd tabs get sized correctly, but as you see further below, I get an error when trying to trace out the text of the 2nd and 3rd tab.</p>

<p>♥ Update: <em>Added entire TabMenu class in hopes of getting this resolved :)</em>
I now believe this is where my problem lies:</p>

<pre><code>// tabNamer creates the active &amp; default textfields
tabNamer(tabNameActive,  Fonts.ActiveTabText,  tabData[0].id); // for ActiveTab
tabNamer(tabNameDefault, Fonts.DefaultTabText, tabData[i].id); // for DefaultTabs
</code></pre>

<p><strong>tabNamer</strong> is a function containing just a textField, and I believe I keep overriding the last textField made, this is why only the 4th and last textField shows text. Is there a way to dynamically name my textFeilds are I loop?
<br/><br/></p>

<p>My guess is that your textfield 'tabNameActive' is on the stage. If that's the case, you need to do the following:</p>

<p>1) Delete the tabNameActive from the stage</p>

<p>2) Go to your library and find the the tabNameActive. Right-click and click properties. Check ""Export on first frame"".</p>

<p>3) A window shows up. Now give a class identifier ""TabNameActiveClass"". </p>

<p>4) Go back to your code. Within the for loop, add this  below the variable declarations.</p>

<pre><code>var tab:MovieClip = new TabDefault();
var active:MovieClip = new TabActive();
var tabNameActive:TabNameActiveClass = new TabNameActiveClass();
</code></pre>

<p>This <em>should</em> work. </p>

<p>Recap: Basically, you make your text as a class and make different instance of it in the loop. Right now, you are just reusing the instance and it basically gets moved from tab 1 to 4 during creation.</p>

<p><strong>EDTIED in response to comments below:</strong></p>

<p>Remove from your class definition:</p>

<pre><code>private var tabNameDefault:TextField = new TextField();
private var tabNameActive :TextField = new TextField();
</code></pre>

<p>Then add with your loop:</p>

<pre><code>var tab:MovieClip = new TabDefault();
var active:MovieClip = new TabActive();
var tabNameActive:TextField = new TextField();
var tabNameDefault:TextField = new TextField();
</code></pre>
"
"2210694","<p>Basically, the below image represents the components on the homepage of a site I'm working on, which will have news components all over the place. The sql snippets envision how I think they should work, I would really appreciate some business logic advice from people who've worked with news sites before though. Here's how I envision it:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/TTLh2.gif"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><strong>Question #1</strong>: Does the sql logic make sense? Are there any caveats/flaws that you can see?</p>

<p>My schema would be something like:</p>

<pre><code>articles:

article_id int unsigned not null primary key,
article_permalink varchar(100),
article_name varchar(100),
article_snippet text,
article_full text
article_type tinyint(3) default 1
</code></pre>

<p>I would store all articles ( main featured, sub-featured, the rest ) in one table, I would categorize them by a <code>type</code> column, which would correspond to a number in my <code>news_types</code> table ( for the example I used literal text as it's easier to understand ).</p>

<p><strong>Question #1.1</strong>: Is it alright to rely on one table for different types of articles?</p>

<p>A news article can have 3 image types:</p>

<ul>
<li>1x original image size, which would show up only on the article's permalink page</li>
<li>1x main featured image, which would show up on the homepage section #1</li>
<li>1x sub featured image, which would show up in the homepage section #2</li>
</ul>

<p>For now I want each article to correspond to one image and not multiple. A user can post images for the article in the <code>article_full</code> TEXT column though.</p>

<p><strong>Question #1.2</strong>: I'm not sure how I should incorporate the article images into my schema, is it common for a schema that relies on 2 tables like this?</p>

<p>article_image_links:</p>

<pre><code>article_id article_image_id
1          1
</code></pre>

<p>article_images:</p>

<pre><code>article_image_id article_image_url
1                media.site.com/articles/blah.jpg
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Requirements for the data:</strong></p>

<p>From the way I have my sql logic, there has to be some data in order for stuff to show up..</p>

<ul>
<li>there has to be at least one <code>main</code> type article</li>
<li>there has to be at least four <code>featured</code> type articles which are below the main one</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Question #1.3</strong>: Should I bother creating special cases for if data is missing? For example, if there's no main featured article, should I select the latest featured, or should I make it a requirement that someone always specify a main article?</p>

<p><strong>Question #1.4</strong>: In the admin, when a user goes to post, by default I'll have a dropdown which specifies the article type, <code>normal</code> will be pre-selected and it will have the option for <code>main</code> and <code>featured</code>. So if a user at one point decides to change the article type, he/she can do that.</p>

<p><strong>Question #1.5</strong>: The way my featured and main articles work is only by the latest date. If the user wants, for example, to specify an older article for whatever reason as the main article, should I create custom logic, or just tell them to update the article date so it's later than the latest?</p>
","Is this how a modern news site would handle it's sql/business logic?","<sql><mysql><django><database-design><business-logic>","2010-02-05 21:47:16","270","2210752","1","<p>In regard to the question in the title there is definitely more than one way to skin a cat.  What's right for one site may not be right for another.  Some things that could factor into your decision are how large the site needs to be scaled (eg are there going to be dozens of articles or millions?) and who will be entering the data (eg how much idiot-proofness do you need to build in).  I'll try to answer the questions as best I can based on the information you gave.</p>

<p><strong>Question # 1:</strong> Yes, looks fine to me.  Be sure to set your indexes (I'd put indexes on [type,date] and [category,type,date]).</p>

<p><strong>Question #1.1:</strong> Yes, I would say that is alright, in fact, I would say it is preferred.  If I understand the question correctly (that this is as opposed to a table for each ""type"") then this sets you up better for adding new types in the future if you want to.</p>

<p><strong>Question #1.2:</strong> If you only want one image for each story and one story for each image I'm not seeing the advantage of splitting that up into an extra table.  It seems like it's just more overhead.  But I could be missing something here.</p>

<p><strong>Question #1.3:</strong> That's a design decision up to you, there's no ""right"" answer here.  It all depends on your intended uses of the system.</p>

"2213881","<p>I personally like the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/fieldset"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code></a> tag because of how it draws a box and puts the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/legend"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>&lt;legend&gt;</code></a> at the top of it, over the border. Like this.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/VJ2lh.png"" alt=""example image of what I&#39;m trying to achieve""></p>

<p>However, the <code>fieldset</code> element was made to organize <a href=""http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/form"" rel=""noreferrer"">forms</a>, and using it for general design is no better than using tables for general design. So, my question is... <strong>how can I achieve the same result using another tag?</strong> The border has to be erased under the <code>&lt;legend&gt;</code> (or whatever other tag will be used), and since there could be a ""complex"" body background image, I can't afford to just set the <code>background-color</code> of the legend to match the one of the element under.</p>

<p>I'd like it to work without JavaScript, but CSS3 and XML-based formats (such as SVG or XHTML) are fine.</p>

<p>Of course, I couldn't resist having a go at it anyway.

But mine doesn't need the fixed width ""legend"".</p>

<p>This code is evidently a bit of a hack, though, and I don't know how well it'll fare in complex sites. I also agree with Anonymous that using a fieldset for grouping isn't nearly as bad as using tables for layout. Fieldsets were <em>designed</em> for grouping elements, though in HTML they're really only supposed to be used for grouping form controls.</p>

<p>note: you will need to use some amount of padding on the li to push the text away from the background image. you can adjust the position of the background image using the last two parameters (which i've set to 0). the first digit is x-axis and the second one is y-axis. so to move the background image 2px to the right and 2px up</p>

<p>As you can see, about half of the code is wrapped up in the initialization in the <code>window.onload</code>.  This can be mitigated by using a framework.  Here's a version using jQuery:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() {
    $(""label.magiclabel[for]"").each(function(index, label) {
        label = $(label);
        var associated = $(""#"" + label.attr(""for""));

        if ( associated.length ) {
            new MagicLabel(label, associated);
        }
    });
});

var MagicLabel = function(label, input) {
    // If the field has something in it already, hide the label
    if ( input.val() !== """" ) {
        label.addClass(""hidden"");
    }

    label.click(function() { label.addClass(""hidden""); });
    input.focus(function() { label.addClass(""hidden""); });
    input.blur(function() {
        if ( input.val() === """" ) {

"2220650","<p>For an application I'm working on, I'd like to implement sort of a gauge-like control. The gauge should be of vertical orientation and I'd like to get the effect of a dial with the values printed on it to move vertically so that the current value appears at the center of the gauge. While the part of the dial that is not currently visible gets clipped.</p>

<p>I thought a good approach would be to have one UIView that acts as the top visible part (the gauge's window if you will) and a subview that just draws the dial with the values and markers. The top view would receive a message indicating the value to display and move the subview around so that the current value is centered while the part of the dial that is not currently visible gets clipped. I tried to do a little illustration of this (the part of the dial that is grayed-out should be clipped):</p>

<p>I'm am unsure how to set up the views so that I can actually get this to work. I tried around with two UIView subclasses but the view rendering the dial would just paint at some unexpected location on the screen and wouldn't be clipped by the parent view.</p>

<p>I'm really just looking for general advice on the parts needed to implement a control like this. Does it make sense to use two views as I tried to describe or should I implement this as one single UIView subclass that just figures out which part of the dial to draw whenever the value is changed? Or maybe something completely different?</p>

<p>From what I read in your question, this should give you what you need.</p>

<p>So you could have a content view is that is say, for arguments sake, 50x320, and the scroll view be only 50 x 50. The area of the content view will be clipped to the 50x50 size, and you will be able to move the content view by scrolling with your finger, like other native iPhone controls.</p>

<p>Many, if not all, iPhone apps use a scroll view in some way. <code>UITableView</code>s are subclasses of scroll views, as are <code>UITextView</code>s.</p>

"2224122","<p>I just started making games and I decided for my next project to use either flashdevelop or  flex builder. Reason being is because you can embed just about everything and for licensing purposes and it recommended the the game is compiled into one file. flex sdk is good with that type of stuff.</p>

<p>As of right now I decided to use flashdevelop. but recently it's been kicking my behind. First I wasnt able to use ui class (e.i. buttons, and textboxes) probably because of something stupid I did. Now for some reason I can not compile my applications. When I compile, nothing happens, no errors, no nothing. below is a screenshot of what happens when I compile.</p>

<p>Yes i installed debugger and yes I installed sdk</p>

<p><img src=""https://i159.photobucket.com/albums/t150/numerical25/delete-1.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>So now I was thinking about just going with flex builder. Not sure which one is more easier to assemble and use. But I do know the flex builder community is bigger, and they have a much better documentation. I am good with actionscript, but I am not so good with using flex.</p>

<p>My ultimate question is...</p>

<p>Which one is easier to assemble
which one is easier to use
which one is BETTER overall</p>
","flashdevelop vs flex builder","<apache-flex><flash><actionscript-3><actionscript>","2010-02-08 19:06:14","6496","2227109","4","<p>as far as not compiling goes, looks like it compiled just fine.
I don't know what you're expecting to see from the code other than the ""Hello""
to see that open up your output window (under View)</p>

<p>Whether you use flex or flashdevelop, you end up using the same compiler.</p>

<p>Like Adam, I find flashdevelop easier to use than flex, but that's because I've used it more (flex trial expired and FD didn't)</p>

<p>And plus I'm fast with FD, like really fast :)</p>

<p>Try some of the shortcuts:</p>

<ul>
<li>to create getter and setter or
generate function press 'ctrl shift ~' and PRESTO</li>
<li>or for a for loop or for each loop type in the first few
letters and press 'ctrl B'</li>
<li>to find   instances of any string in code you
can do F3 and shift F3, whereas F4
will find the object or function
declaration(even in separate files)</li>
<li>FD also adds a lot of the classes as
needed (sometimes I have to do it manually)</li>
<li>and the latest version lets
you generate classes which extend
another class easier.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm sure that flax does most of this as-well, but when you're already used to this then switching slows you down.</p>

<p>I had the same issues when I started working with FD. What it boils down to is that flex has a bunch of libraries that it's using that FD doesn't unless you link to them, and sometimes even then.</p>

<p>But once you start compiling your libraries and assets into SWCs you will be able to compile them through Flash and Flex. Which can be handy (like when you're working with other developers)</p>

<p>FD doesn't have a profiler, but this has not prompted me to stop using it. When I need some debugging and trace isn't enough I add the demonsters debugger class: <a href=""http://www.monsterdebugger.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.monsterdebugger.com/</a> it's pretty powerful, but you still can't step through your code.
** Update - Flash Develop has had a profiler for a few versions now, It's good for watching memory use, but I still end up using monster debugger a lot. You can use debug in Flash Develop as-well and step through your code.**</p>

<p>FD doesn't have the UI that flex does, and for developing mxml it is a bit more tedious, but at pure as3, I find FD is all I need. Well than and Flash to create my SWCs</p>

<p>This could be good for testing a canvas-based game, ensuring a given state is entered when certain keys are pressed on the canvas.</p>

<p>However, this won't allow you to control any form-based interaction, or native prompts.  So you can't start the MIDlet, navigate through a LCDUI <code>Form</code> or <code>List</code>, accept a native security prompt, or edit a native <code>TextBox</code>.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Trying to draw on the desktop DC is out. From Greg Schechter's <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/greg_schechter/redirecting-gdi-directx-and-wpf-applications"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Redirecting GDI, DirectX, and WPF applications</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drawing To and Reading From the Screen
-- Baaaad!</p>
<p>Lastly, since we're on the redirection
topic, one particularly dangerous
practice is writing to the screen,
either through the use of GetDC(NULL)
and writing to that, or attempting to
do XOR rubber-band lines, etc.  There
are two big reasons that writing to
the screen is bad:</p>
<p>It's expensive... writing to the
screen itself isn't expensive, but it
is almost always accompanied by
reading from the screen because one
typically does read-modify-write
operations like XOR when writing to
the screen.  Reading from the video
memory surface is very expensive,
requires synchronization with the DWM,
and stalls the entire GPU pipe, as
well as the DWM application pipe.<br />
It's unpredictable... if you somehow
manage to get to the actual primary
and write to it, there can be no
predictability as to how long what you
wrote to the primary will remain on
screen.  Since the UCE doesn't know
about it, it may get cleared in the
next frame refresh, or it may persist
for a very long time, depending on
what else needs to be updated on the
screen.  (We really don't allow direct
writing to the primary anyhow, for
that very reason... if you try to
access the DirectDraw primary, for
instance, the DWM will turn off until
the accessing application exits)</p>

<p>Hello, I have an image as shown above. Is it possible for me to detect the center point of the cross and output the result using Matlab? Thanks.</p>
","Detecting center point of cross using Matlab","<matlab><image-processing><computer-vision>","2010-02-11 03:44:16","9663","2242565","6","<p>Here you go. I'm assuming that you have the image toolbox because if you don't then you probably shouldn't be trying to do this sort of thing. However, all of these functions can be implemented with convolutions I believe. I did this process on the image you presented above and obtained the point (139,286) where 138 is the row and 268 is the column.</p>

<p>1.Convert the image to a binary image:</p>

<pre><code>bw = bw2im(img, .25);
</code></pre>

<p>where img is the original image. Depending on the image you might have to adjust the second parameters (which ranges from 0 to 1) so that you only get the cross. Don't worry about the cross not being fully connected because we'll remedy that in the next step.</p>

<p>2.Dilate the image to join the parts. I had to do this twice because I had to set the threshold so low on the binary image conversion (some parts of your image were pretty dark). Dilation essentially just adds pixels around existing white pixels (I'll also be inverting the binary image as I send it into bwmorph because the operations are made to act on white pixels which are the ones that have a value of 1).</p>

<pre><code>bw2 = bwmorph(~bw, 'dilate', 2);
</code></pre>

<p>The last parameter says how many times to do the dilation operation.</p>

<p>3.Shrink the image to a point.</p>

<pre><code>bw3 = bwmorph(bw2, 'shrink',Inf);
</code></pre>

<p>Again, the last parameter says how many times to perform the operation. In this case I put in Inf which shrinks until there is only one pixel that is white (in other words a 1).</p>

<p>4.Find the pixel that is still a 1.</p>

<pre><code>[i,j] = find(bw3);
</code></pre>

<p>Here, i is the row and j is the column of the pixel in bw3 such that bw3(i,j) is equal to 1. All the other pixels should be 0 in bw3.</p>

<p>There might be other ways to do this with bwmorph, but I think that this way works pretty well. You might have to adjust it depending on the picture too. I can include images of each step if desired.</p>

        Page p = downloadPage(l);
        queue.offer(p);
     }

<p>You'll have to implement the Page, Link, and downloadPage functions.  When you start, you'll have to <b>seed</b> one of the queues in order to get started, probably the link queue. It's stylistically bad form to call partner.queue.take() directly, rather you'd have a function that would abstract that. I'm trying to make the code concise and easy to understand here. </p>

"2244599","<p>I'm building a first person shooter using OpenGL, and I'm trying to get a gun model to float in front of the camera. I've ripped a model from Fallout 3 using a resource decompiler (converted to .obj and loaded in).</p>

<p>However, this is what it looks like on the screen: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/3B9aH.png"" alt=""Screenshot""></p>

<p>Half the gun's triangles are clipped to what appears to be the frustum.</p>

<p>I put it in front of my camera like this:</p>

<pre><code>glPushMatrix();
    glLoadIdentity();

    glTranslatef(m_GunPos.x, m_GunPos.y, m_GunPos.z);
    glRotatef(m_GunRot.x, 1, 0, 0);
    glRotatef(m_GunRot.y, 0, 1, 0);
    glRotatef(m_GunRot.z, 0, 0, 1);
    glScalef(m_GunScale.x, m_GunScale.y, m_GunScale.z);

    m_Gun-&gt;Render(NULL);
glPopMatrix();
</code></pre>

<p>So I save the original <code>GL_MODELVIEW</code> matrix, load the identity matrix, translate my gun to be slightly to the right of my camera and render it. This is my render routine for a SceneNode:</p>

<pre><code>glPushMatrix();
    if (m_Model) { m_Model-&gt;Render(&amp;final); }

    if (m_Children.size() &gt; 0)
    {
        for (std::vector&lt;SceneNode*&gt;::iterator i = m_Children.begin(); i != m_Children.end(); ++i)
        {
            (*i)-&gt;Render(&amp;final);
        }
    }
glPopMatrix();
</code></pre>

<p>So it renders its own model and any child SceneNode's. Finally, the actual mesh rendering looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (m_Material)
{
    glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, m_Material-&gt;m_TexDiffuse);
}

glEnableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY);
glEnableClientState(GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY);
glEnableClientState(GL_NORMAL_ARRAY);

glVertexPointer(3, GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Vec3), &amp;m_Vertex[0]);
glNormalPointer(GL_FLOAT, sizeof(Vec3), &amp;m_Normal[0]);

You should be able to push the projection matrix, call gluPerspective (or glFrustrum, if you're adventurous) to set znear to a very small value, draw the gun, then pop the projection matrix and draw the rest of the scene (beware, however, that the projection matrix stack is often pretty shallow -- it can be as little as two levels).</p>

<p>One caveat: I've never really thought through how this should affect z-fighting. It might not do any real good -- it could work out the same as if you had the smaller znear value while drawing the whole scene.</p>

There are very few reasons for it to fail, the most common one is a gross mistake in the window procedure for the window.  That certainly is not the case for the Form class, I've only ever seen Windows Forms programs fail with this error because the process exceeded its handle quota.</p>

<p>To explain that is going to require some hand waving.  First off, by default a Windows process is only allowed to create 10,000 handles, GDI objects and user32 objects.  It is of course very unlikely that your program consumed that many right at start up.  Seeing this happen when it is started by the installer is however a lead.  Msi.exe gets special dispensation, it is allowed to create many more handles.  I've seen it do this, the VS2008 service pack 1 installer I ran on an old unpatched version of XP got up to 500,000 handles about 2 hours after I started it before it decided a reboot was necessary to complete the install.</p>

<p>Your installer would use CreateProcess() to start the program.  It has an argument named bInheritHandles that determines whether or not the child process inherits the handles of the parent process.  A possible scenario is thus that the installer consumes many handles, and that it has the bInheritHandles argument set to TRUE.  Your WF program would then start with its handle quota already exceeded, creating another handle will fail.  The SetVisibleCore() method is indeed the one that creates the main form's Handle property.</p>

<p>This is all conjecture of course, you should be able to see this for yourself with Taskmgr.exe, Process tab while the process is displaying the exception dialog.  Use View + Select Columns and tick Handles, GDI Object and USER objects.  An ultimate fix is going to require finding out why the installer is consuming so many handles.  Or using a different way to start the program.</p>

"2246874","<p>iWork has the ability to highlight text and then tag a comment to that text. The comment then is linked with a line to the highlighted text.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/yj8C6.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I'm curious if something like this could be implemented in JQUERY. What has me puzzled is:
A. How to draw a line and have it update when a user changes the text
B. How to highlight text and have it tagged somehow?</p>

<p>Id love to hear your thoughts on if this is even possible with JQUERY and any ideas or plugins to point me in the right direction.</p>
","iWork Comment Ability, Is this possible to implement using JQUERY","<jquery><jquery-plugins><iwork>","2010-02-11 18:52:13","593","2291450","4","<p>Yes, this is not very difficult to accomplish.</p>

<p>First - You need to get the select event</p>

<p>The select event is sent to an element when the user makes a text selection inside it. This event is limited to  fields and  boxes.</p>

<p>For example, consider the HTML:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form&gt;
  &lt;input id=""target"" type=""text"" value=""Hello there"" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;div id=""other""&gt;
  Trigger the handler
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The event handler can be bound to the text input:</p>

<pre><code>$('#target').select(function() {
  alert('Handler for .select() called.');
});
</code></pre>

<p>SEE: <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/select/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://api.jquery.com/select/</a></p>

<p>Second - You need to create a tag</p>

<p>CSS</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
body{font-size:12px; font-family:""Trebuchet MS"";}
#content1{
border:1px solid #CCCC33;
padding:10px;
margin-top:10px;
width:500px;
}
&lt;/style&gt;

(X)HTML

&lt;a href=""#"" id=""click""&gt;Something Here&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;div class=""box""&gt;
&lt;div id=""content1""&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" id=""close""&gt;Close&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see it is a very simple example, but the use of this it just about limitless!</p>

<p>Now for the jQuery code that does all the funky stuff. What I am going to do is Show and Hide the Content1 Div element. For that I created the jQuery code below, have a look then I will go through it.</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){

$('#content1').hide();

$('a').click(function(){
$('#content1').show('slow');
});

$('a#close').click(function(){
$('#content1').hide('slow');
})

});
</code></pre>

<p>As I mentioned earlier the $(document).ready(function()} is a function that waits until the page is ready to be manipulated before executing the code inside it.</p>

<p>The next line $('#content1').hide(); Hides the Content1 Div to start with. Notice how there is a relationship between jQuery and CSS in that is uses the, ID is this case, but it could use a class in exactly the same manner, as the argument inside the parenthesis.</p>

<p>We then move onto the next section of code that “Shows” the DIV when the linked text is clicked. $('a).click(function(){}); This is calling the “click” function and then invoking the “show” effect on the Content1 Div.</p>

<p>Read the code again and make sure you get a grip on the logic. It took me a little while to get the hang of it as well !!!</p>

<p>Inside that Div that is being Shown and Hidden there is another text link that will Hide the Div.</p>

<pre><code>$('a#close').click(function(){
$('#content1').hide('slow');
})
</code></pre>

<p>If you look at this you can see that any “a” (link) element with an ID of “close” will invoke the “hide” Effect on the Content 1 Div.</p>

"2250293","<p>I've been banging my head for a long time on this one</p>

<p>I am doing imaging. So far I've binarized my images, meaning that from a grayscale image, every pixel under a certain value are dropped. This gives me only some regions out of the original image with a lot of ""zero pixels"" all around those regions.</p>

<p>Next I've run length encoded my regions into ""blobs"". Runs are a method of compression for data. For example, suppose that you have binarized a square, the you will have only a few runs describing the whole image.
The runs are defined by x,y coordinates and a length.</p>

<p>When recreating the image, for each run, go to x,y coordinate and add pixels on the x axis for the length of the run.</p>

<p>Now I have to take the runs and create a chain out of it that will describe the contour of the region.
I don't know how to do that.</p>

<p>I have a bunch of x,y,length runs and I have to ""navigate"" around the edges to form a <a href=""http://www.ph.tn.tudelft.nl/Courses/FIP/noframes/fip-Contour.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">chain</a>. Normally in imaging this process is done with the original image but I can't use the original image anymore here so I have to compute it with the runs.</p>

"2250606","<p>I've built a UserControl that extends the functionality of the ComboBox in interesting and useful ways.  It looks like this when it's dropped down:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/lwDVO.jpg"" alt=""My user control""></p>

<p>I've built a whole bunch of features into the control and they all work smoothly.  This leads me to believe that I have something of a clue as to what I'm doing.  You'd think it would be a trivial matter to have the UserControl's style set the editable TextBox's background brush.  In fact, it appears to be freaking impossible.  And I'm baffled.</p>

<p>The UserControl's XAML, <em>extremely</em> abbreviated (you'll thank me for this), looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl x:Class=""MyApp.CodeLookupBox"" x:Name=""MainControl""&gt;
    &lt;UserControl.Resources&gt;
       &lt;!-- tons of DataTemplates and Styles, most notably the style that
            contains the control template for the ComboBox --&gt;
    &lt;UserControl.Resources&gt;
    &lt;ComboBox x:Name=""ComboBox"" 
                   Margin=""0"" 
                   Style=""{DynamicResource ComboBoxStyle1}"" 
                   VerticalAlignment=""Top""
                   ItemTemplate=""{StaticResource GridViewStyleTemplate}""/&gt;
&lt;/UserControl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>There's a lot of code-behind in this control, mostly dependency properties that I use for things like selecting the template that's used in the dropdown.</p>

<p>What's making me crazy is the editable text box.  I want to be able to set its background brush from the user control's style - e.g., when I declare one of these user controls in my XAML, it uses a style like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Style TargetType=""{x:Type local:CodeLookupBox}""&gt;
    &lt;Style.Triggers&gt;
        &lt;DataTrigger Binding=""{Binding IsRequired}"" Value=""True""&gt;
            &lt;Setter Property=""EditableTextBoxBackground"" Value=""{StaticResource RequiredFieldBrush}""/&gt;
        &lt;/DataTrigger&gt;
    &lt;/Style.Triggers&gt;
&lt;/Style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I started out life simply setting the UserControl's Background, but that set the background <em>behind</em> the editable TextBox.  The TextBox itself remained white.</p>

<p>Inside the template for the ComboBox, there's a style that controls that TextBox:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Style x:Key=""ComboBoxEditableTextBox"" TargetType=""{x:Type TextBox}""&gt;
    &lt;Setter Property=""OverridesDefaultStyle"" Value=""true""/&gt;
    &lt;Setter Property=""AllowDrop"" Value=""true""/&gt;
    &lt;Setter Property=""MinWidth"" Value=""0""/&gt;
    &lt;Setter Property=""MinHeight"" Value=""0""/&gt;
    &lt;Setter Property=""FocusVisualStyle"" Value=""{x:Null}""/&gt;

    &lt;Setter Property=""Template""&gt;
        &lt;Setter.Value&gt;
            &lt;ControlTemplate TargetType=""{x:Type TextBox}""&gt;
                &lt;ScrollViewer 
                            x:Name=""PART_ContentHost"" 
                            Focusable=""false"" 
                            HorizontalScrollBarVisibility=""Hidden"" 
                            VerticalScrollBarVisibility=""Hidden""/&gt;
            &lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
        &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;
    &lt;/Setter&gt;
&lt;/Style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And there is the TextBox (inside the ComboBox's control template) its bad self:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextBox 
    x:Name=""PART_EditableTextBox"" 
    Margin=""{TemplateBinding Padding}"" 
    Style=""{StaticResource ComboBoxEditableTextBox}"" 
    HorizontalContentAlignment=""{TemplateBinding HorizontalContentAlignment}"" 
    VerticalContentAlignment=""{TemplateBinding VerticalContentAlignment}""
    IsReadOnly=""{Binding IsReadOnly, RelativeSource={RelativeSource TemplatedParent}}""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, there's a definite element of Things Man Was Not Meant To Know about that ComboBoxEditableTextBox style.  What is that ScrollViewer doing in there?  I have no idea.  I can tell you that if I comment out the part of the style that sets the TextBox's ControlTemplate, very bad things happen.</p>

<p>And I also know this:  If I explicitly set the TextBox's Background brush as one of the style's setters, nothing happens.  If I explicitly set the Background on the PART_EditableTextBox, nothing happens.  (I can set its Foreground, or its FontFamily, and they work just fine.)  </p>

<p>If I explicitly set the Background of that ScrollViewer to Green, though, voila, the TextBox turns green.</p>

<p>Okay then, so the TextBox is ignoring its own Background, and using the one from its control template.  Actually, it's not, strictly speaking, using the one from the control template either.  When I set the ScrollViewer's background, there's a decided margin around the edges of the color, instead of the color filling the TextBox entirely.  But that margin is white, not the background color.</p>

<p>Unless I can figure out why the TextBox is ignoring its Background, I have to live with tweaking the ScrollViewer.  So how do I get it to get the brush from the user control's EditableTextBoxBackground property?  I've made this a dependency property that raises the PropertyChanged event properly when it changes.  I'm binding to it in the mysterious ScrollViewer's XAML like this:</p>

<pre><code>Background=""{Binding ElementName=MainControl, 
    Path=EditableTextBoxBackground, 
    Converter={StaticResource DebuggingConverter}}""
</code></pre>

<p>I've set a breakpoint in my debugging converter.  When the control is first drawn, it gets hit twice.  The first time, the value of the brush is null.  The second time, it's the right value.  And if I set the property in my UserControl's <em>constructor</em>, it works.</p>

<p>So here's what I know:  My UserControl's property is being set properly.  The binding on the TextBox's style is correctly bound to the UserControl's property.  The binding on the ScrollViewer in the TextBox's control template is bound to the right property.  The property raises PropertyChanged with the right property name when it's changed, and the binding pushes the value out to the ScrollViewer Background property.</p>

<p>And nothing happens.</p>

<p>So I guess I have a three part question:  1) Why?  2) What the heck is that ScrollViewer doing in there in the first place?  I have my suspicions, but it's one in the morning and it's getting hard for me to articulate them.  3) Why did Blend give me a different control template to work with than the much more comprehensible one found <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms752094.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>?</p>

<p>Really, any help would be appreciated.</p>
","Why can't I reset the Background of the TextBox in my UserControl?","<wpf><templates><user-controls><controls><styles>","2010-02-12 09:00:56","1118","2250772","1","<p>You have questions.  I have answers.</p>

<p><strong>1- Why is the ScrollViewer's Background binding behaving so strangely?</strong></p>

<p>When a <code>TextBox</code> is first measured, it instantiates its template.  This creates the <code>ScrollViewer</code>.  Once the template is applied, the <code>TextBox</code> checks to see if the <code>ScrollViewer</code>'s <code>Background</code> property currently has a null value.  If so, it overwrites it with <code>Background.Transparent</code>.  Doing so disconnects your binding.</p>

<p>This is why it works when you set it in the constructor but not later on:  The TextBox saw the null value and overwrote it with Background.Transparent, breaking the binding.</p>

<p><strong>2- What is the ScrollViewer doing there anyway?</strong></p>

<p><code>TextBox</code> is a <code>Control</code> that doesn't actually handle any of the gory details of text presentation itself - if you browse the visual tree you'll see that this is handled by another <code>Visual</code> with a name something like ""TextView"".  <code>TextBox</code>'s main job is actually to present the border around the textbox and/or allow you to give it a totally new look.</p>

<p><code>TextBox</code> requires a template with an elemnent named <code>PART_ContentHost</code> which is either a <code>ContentPresenter</code> or a <code>ScrollViewer</code>.  If it is a simple <code>ContentPresenter</code>, the internal ""TextView"" object is simply added to it.  If it is a <code>ScrollViewer</code>, the <code>TextBox</code> also wires up some additional functionality such as scrolling text into view when it is focused.</p>

<p>The <code>ScrollViewer</code>'s purpose in life is to allow the text in the <code>TextBox</code> to scroll horizontally, and also scroll vertically for multiline text boxes.</p>

<p><strong>3- Why did Blend give me a different control template</strong></p>

<p>Blend loads the actual <code>ControlTemplate</code> XAML from the referenced assemblies, in this case PresentationFramework.dll and the associated theme dll for the current system theme.  So it will load what is <em>actually being used</em> in the version of NET Framework you have installed.  The XAML on the site you linked is just example code, and is not the actual NET Framework XAML.</p>

<p><strong>I added two more relevant questions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>4- Why didn't setting the TextBox's Background property work?</strong></p>

<p>None of WPF's <code>Control</code> subclasses actually implement their <code>Background</code> properties themselves.  The <code>Background</code> DependencyProperty is just a named brush that a Control's template can bind to <em>if it likes</em>.  This is just as true for <code>TextBox</code> as for any other <code>Control</code>.  The default <code>TextBox</code> template includes a ""chrome"" object that includes code to display the background, similar to what you might use a border for.  Since <code>ComboBox</code> is already displaying its own ""chrome"", it uses its own <code>TextBox</code> template that includes the <code>ScrollViewer</code> but not the surrounding chrome.  That is why setting the <code>Background</code> property on the <code>TextBox</code> inside a <code>ComboBox</code> has no effect.</p>

<p><strong>5- How do I solve my problem and bind the background color of the TextBox inside the ComboBox</strong></p>

<p>If you're ok with the white margin you can simply wrap the <code>ScrollViewer</code> inside in a <code>&lt;Border&gt;</code> and set the background on the <code>&lt;Border&gt;</code>.  If not, you will have to move the desired background into the chrome supplied in the main <code>ControlTemplate</code> for the <code>ComboBox</code>.</p>

<li>It uses a different fonts and colors item, named ""Selection Foreground"", instead of the regular ""Selected Text"" item.  It'll be (alphabetically) towards the bottom.</li>

<p>C with <code>-O3</code>:</p>

<pre><code>real    0m0.003s
user    0m0.000s
sys     0m0.002s

<p>Your java program:</p>

<pre><code>real    0m0.294s
user    0m0.269s
sys     0m0.051s
</code></pre>

<p>Some more details; without optimization, the C compiles to:</p>

<pre><code>0000000100000f18 pushq %rbp
0000000100000f19 movq %rsp,%rbp
0000000100000f1c movl %edi,0xec(%rbp)

0000000100000f3c leave

<p>With optimization (<code>-O3</code>), it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>0000000100000f30 pushq %rbp
0000000100000f31 movq %rsp,%rbp

0000000100000f37 ret
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the entire loop has been removed.  <code>javap -c Loop</code> gave me this output for the java bytecode:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
  Code:
   0:   iconst_0
   1:   istore_1
   2:   iload_1
   3:   iinc    1, 1

   8:   if_icmpge   14
   11:  goto    2

<p>It appears the loop is compiled in, I guess something happens at runtime to speed that one up. (As others have mentioned, the JIT compiler squashes out the loop.)</p>

It works with <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/canviz/wiki/Browsers"" rel=""noreferrer"">most browsers</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using Canviz has advantages for your web application over generating and sending bitmapped images and imagemaps to the browser:</p>
<ul>
<li>The server only needs to have Graphviz generate xdot text; this is faster than generating bitmapped images.</li>
<li>Only the xdot text needs to be transferred to the browser; this is smaller than binary image data, and, if the browser supports it (which most do), the text can be gzip- or bzip2-compressed.</li>
<li>The web browser performs the drawing, not the server; this reduces server load.</li>
<li>The user can resize the graph without needing to involve the server; this is faster than having the server draw and send the graph in a different size.</li>

"2264948","<p>The main problem is that in my sp there are different objects and logic that may cause lack of performance.</p>

<p>The things that I see on my SP and the tables that are in use in the SP
1- Temp tables such as shown below; (2 Temp Tables)</p>

<p>CREATE TABLE #TEMP_TABLE(
  AB INT NOT NULL,
  AC INT NOT NULL,
  AD INT NOT NULL,
  AF INT NULL,
  AG INT NULL,
  REFERENCE_NUMBER INT NULL
 )
 CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_1 ON #TEMP_TABLE (AB , AC, AD)</p>

<p>2- Insert process to the create temp table as TEMP1 in the SP</p>

<p>3- DROP TABLE #TEMP_TABLE
   DROP TABLE #TEMP_TABLE2
in the end of the SP</p>

<p>4- There are two tables used to join themselves, but not all the fields that are used ""on"" case of JOIN operator. For instance; there are clustered index fields declared on the first table, plus date column which is not in the clustered index groups of the first table..</p>

<p>For short; Clustered and non clustered indexes are important ok, but in which order should i declare them. What i need from which index type, tell me the order of cretation of indexes for further use of JOIN process etc.</p>

<p>5- Should I use table variable instead of temp table.  Ok it will be better but there are lots of question mark that does not let me to use the table variables..</p>

<p>*An INSERT into a table variable will not take advantage of parallelism.

<p>... is not actually adding the ListItem to ListView1. After you declare and set up ListItem, <em>then</em> add it to the ListView control:</p>

"2268675","<p>I'm looking for a solid graphing plugin for JQuery that can give me an attractive scatterplot for use on my site. I really don't need a lot of fancy functionality -- just the ability to plot points on a graph based on the X-axis and Y-axis values I give it.</p>

<p>The only somewhat peculiar requirement I have is that the dots have the ability to be different colors. In addition to tracking the item's ""State"" on the X-Axis, and it's ""Input Time"" on the Y-Axix, I want to represent it's ""Status"" (not to be confused with ""State"") by the actual color of the dot. Incidentally, there are 5 States, and 5 Statuses.</p>

<p>I found a couple of promising ones in a quick Google search, but didn't see the ability to specify the color of the dot (I found one that let me change the size, however). Any suggestions anyone has would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Below is kind of what I'm going for, but I think the dots would be arranged more cleanly in 5 distinct columns (based on the 5 States). But it might help with visualization.</p>

"2269798","<p>In the past, I have used Vim as a note taking platform by creating an index.txt file with a list of tags using the Vim help file format and then creating a bunch of text files that have the normal <code>*Help_Tag*</code> link syntax so that using <code>CTRL-]</code> on a tag in the index.txt file will jump to the respective tag in an arbitrary notes text file. You need to do <code>:helptags dir</code> to generate the tags for the directory (where dir is the path to the notes directory).</p>

"2269838","<p>Consider a database server whose job today is to house one database. Likely the database will be moved in the future to another database instance which houses multiple databases &amp; schemas.</p>

<p>Let's pretend the app/project is called Invoicer 2.0. The database is called AcmeInvoice. The database holds all the invoice, customer, and product information. Here's a diagram of the actors and their roles and behaviour.</p>

<p>The schema(s) will largely be used to easily assign permissions to roles. The added benefit here is that the objects aren't under <code>dbo</code>, and that the objects &amp; permissions can be ported to another machine in the future.</p>

<li>Is it good form to name the schema the same as the database?</li>

Find objects in your database that have common scope or purpose and create a schema to relect that scope.  So for example if you have an entity for Invoices, and you have some supporting lookup tables for invoice states, etc, then put them all in an invoice schema.</p>

<p>As a generally rule of thumb, I would try to avoid using a name that reflects the application name, database name or other concrete/physical things because they can change, and find a name that conceptually represents the scope of your objects that will go into the schema.</p>

<p>Your comment states that ""the schemas will largely be used to easily assign permissions to roles"".  Your diagram shows specific user types having access to some/all tables or some/all stored procs.  I think trying to organize objects conceptually into schemas and organize them from a security standpoint into schemas are conflicting things. I am in favour of creating roles in sql server to reflect the types of users, and grant those roles access to the specific objects that each user type needs, as apposed to granting the role or user access the schema to build your security framework..</p>

<p>When an order is placed in the Orders system, a message is sent out to any subscribers (a pub/sub system), and they can play their part in processing the order. The <em>Orders</em>, <em>Shipping</em> and <em>Invoicing</em> applications have their own ActiveMQ installations, so that if any of the three systems are offline, the others can continue to function. <em>Something</em> takes care of moving messages between the ActiveMQ installs. </p>

<p>Getting Apache Camel to move messages from one queue to another via routes is quite easy, if they are on the same ActiveMQ instance. So this works for managing the subscription queues. </p>

<p>The next challenge is pushing messages from one ActiveMQ instance to another, and it's the bit where I am not sure what to look at next. </p>

<ol>
<li>Can Camel route between different ActiveMQ installations? (I can't figure out what the JMI endpoint URI would be if they are on different machines). </li>
<li>I understand ActiveMQ has <a href=""http://activemq.apache.org/how-do-distributed-queues-work.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">store and forward</a> capabilities. Is this what I would use to move messages between Orders and Shipping/Invoicing?</li>
<li>Or is this what <a href=""http://servicemix.apache.org/home.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Apache ServiceMix</a> is meant to solve?</li>
</ol>
","Distributed ActiveMQ with Camel","<apache-camel><activemq-classic><apache-servicemix>","2010-02-17 09:10:40","6097","2368746","2","<p>This is a pretty straightforward asynchronous, event-driven application that is well-suited for ActiveMQ and Camel. </p>

<p>Actually you do not move messages explicitly from one ActiveMQ instance to another. The way it works is using what's known as a <a href=""http://activemq.apache.org/networks-of-brokers.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">network of brokers</a>. In your case, you'd have three brokers: ActiveMQ-purple, ActiveMQ-green and ActiveMQ-blue. ActiveMQ-purple creates a uni-directional broker network with ActiveMQ-green and ActiveMQ-blue. This allows ActiveMQ-purple to store-and-forward messages to ActiveMQ-green and ActiveMQ-blue based on consumer demand. </p>

<p>The Orders app accepts orders on the orders queue on ActiveMQ-purple. The Orders app uses Camel to consume and process a message to determine if it is an invoicing message or a shipping message. Camel routes the messages to either the invoicing queue or the shipping queue on ActiveMQ-purple. </p>

<p>Consumer demand comes from the Invoicing app and the Shipping app. The Invoicing uses Camel to  consume messages from the invoicing queue on ActiveMQ-green. The Shipping app uses Camel to consume messages from the shipping queue on ActiveMQ-blue. Because of the broker network and because of the consumer demand on the ActiveMQ-green.invoicing queue and the ActiveMQ-blue.shipping queue, messages will be forwarded from ActiveMQ-purple to the appropriate broker and queue. There is no need to explicitly route messages to specific broker. </p>

<p>I hope this answers your questions. Let me know if you have anymore. </p>

<p>In order to use this formula I devided the histogram by number of image pixels. So I got a normalized histogram (probability values).
Then for every pixel of the image I calculated a new value using that formula above, so I just make a sum of elements of normalized histogram. 
For example pixel with value 23 gets a new value which is calculated as the sum of elements of normalized histogram from 0 to 23.
hist[0] + ... + hist[23].
And then multiplying the sum by 255 to get values between 0 and 255 (not between 0 and 1)</p>

<p>An idea, which might work but I have not tested, is to try to estimate the lighting variations and then remove that before thresholding (which is a better term than ""binarization"").
The problem is then moved from adaptive thresholding to finding a good lighting model.</p>

<p>If you know anything about the light sources then you could of course build a model from that. </p>

<p>Otherwise a quick hack that might work is to apply a really heavy low pass filter to your image (blur it) and then use that as your lighting model. Then create a difference image between the original and the blurred version, and threshold that.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: After quick testing, it appears that my ""quick hack"" is not really going to work at all. After thinking about it I am not very surprised either :)</p>

<pre><code>I = someImage
Ib = blur(I, 'a lot!')
Idiff = I - Idiff
It = threshold(Idiff, 'some global threshold')

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>
Got one other idea which could work depending on how your images are generated.
Try estimating the lighting model from the first few rows in the image:</p>

<ol>
<li>Take the first N rows in the image</li>
<li>Create a mean row from the N collected rows. You know have one row as your background model.</li>
<li>For each row in the image subtract the background model row (the mean row).</li>
<li>Threshold the resulting image.</li>

"2283580","<p>I'm using the System.Windows.Controls.WebBrowser for various things in my app and I've noticed that adorners are cut off when they are supposed to appear over a WebBrowser.  I realize that the WebBrowser control is really a wrapper around a COM component and probably renders differently, but I wondered if anyone figured out how to solve this.</p>

<p>This is the problem I'm seeing.  Here I have just a sample adorner that is supposed to draw a big red circle in the top corner of something (as a sample).</p>

<p>When I adorn the WebBrowser with this, I get this result:</p>

<p><img src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/376992/adorner.PNG""></p>

<p>I expect to see the full circle.</p>

<p>Here's the code for this worthless adorner, in case that is helpful:</p>

<pre><code>public class SillyAdorner : Adorner
{
    public SillyAdorner(UIElement element) : base(element)
    {

    }
    protected override void OnRender(DrawingContext drawingContext)
    {
        drawingContext.DrawEllipse(new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Red), new Pen(), new Point(7, 7), 30, 30);
        base.OnRender(drawingContext);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is how I apply it to the browser in the OnRender method of the host control:</p>

<pre><code>    protected override void OnRender(DrawingContext drawingContext)
    {
        base.OnRender(drawingContext);            
        var layer = AdornerLayer.GetAdornerLayer(browser);
        layer.Add(new SillyAdorner(browser));
    }

<p>Anyone have any hacks or workarounds for this?</p>

<p><strong>Edit: I'm using .NET 4.0, if that makes a difference.</strong></p>

<li>Decide on your projection point</li>
<li>Decide on a bunch of lines emanating from your projection point that will give you resolution you need on your warped surface</li>
<li>Determine where these lines intersect your surface (the exact method will depend on your surface representation)</li>
<li>Assume that your flat image is placed somewhere between your projection point and warped surface and find the intersection of the line with the flat surface and assign this value to the location on the warped surface.</li>
</ol>

<p>On the other hand, if your surface is described mathematically, there may be a simple equation for this, as would be the case, for example, if you were mapping a plane to a sphere.</p>

<p>I've never had anything like this happen before, does anyone know what's causing it? Does it even do this for anyone else?

It loads just fine in IE with no weird problems at all.</p>

"2293751","<p>Ok, I'm going to try to make this more clear because my last question was extremely confusing.  I've included a picture this time.  Each one of these circles is a UIImageView and they are each assigned a random image which is one of 7 colors.  So each circle could be one of 7 colors.  I want to make it so that the user has to hit the circles in order of a pre-determined order according to color.  For example, blue, green, yellow, pink, purple, orange, red.  My HUGE problem is that I can't seem to figure out how to determine whether or not a color that isn't supposed to be hit got hit.  Is there a way to assign multiple image views the same value and then somehow have an if statement that says....</p>

<pre><code>if(a blue circle is hit &amp;&amp; ANY ORANGE CIRCLE IS STILL IN VIEW){
do something
}

<p><em>Edited: More information</em>
After the info Bart Gottschalk provided I thought I should add some more information. First, the application is a Navigation Based Application.</p>

<p>Secondly, the test app Bart recommended worked fine, so that takes the modal window and the view out of the equation.</p>

<p>Third, I was presenting the modal view when the <code>-(void)viewWillAppear...</code> delegate method was being called - which may very well be the wrong place... however I'm not 100% sure if I should be presenting the modal view from within the <code>didFinishLaunchingWithOptions</code> of the App Delegate...</p>

<p>It turns out the problem was that I was using a Window instead of a View in the XIB file. This was why when showing the modal view within the Navigation controller it wouldn't display properly (i.e. only a white screen) and why the <code>UITextField</code> would not work properly when showing the view from the <code>RootViewController</code>.</p>

<p>So, to recap - modal views should have <code>UIView</code>, not <code>UIWindow</code> in the XIB/NIB File.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help Bart!</p>

<p>I'm trying to write an algorithm to generate the ""ceiling panel"" from a horiontally wrappable panoramic image like the one above. Images 1 to 4 are a straight cut out for the walls of the cube but the ceiling will be more complicated as I assume it needs to be composited from parts 5a to 5d. Does anyone know the solution in pseudocode?</p>

<p>my guess is that we need to iterate over the coordinates of the ceiling tile
i.e.</p>

<pre><code>for y=0 to height
for x=0 to width
     colorofsomecoordinateonoriginalimage = some function (poloar coords?)
     set pixel(x,y) = colorofsomecoordinateonoriginalimage
next
next

I remember doing something like that for computer vision class one time back in grad school. It's not impossible but a LOT of work needs to be done. One way would be to degrade the entire product's quality. That's the easiest starting point. Once you degraded it enough (depending on how much you need to stretch the edges), you can start applying nonlinear transformations to the image. This is probably best done approximating by maybe cutting out sections of the cylinder by degrees and then applying one of the age old projections used in making flat maps (like Mercator or CADRG or something)... but you have to remember to interpolate the pixels, make sure you at least do an averaging of the pixels to approximate. That's the best I can think of.</p>

"2302832","<p>On iPhone, I am running an app with AsyncUdpSocket library to take care of UDP networking. I have tested it. <strong>I can send UDP packet from my iPhone to a server that runs Java program accepting UDP correctly.</strong></p>

<p><strong>However, when it is the other way around, Java program's UDP message doesn't get through to iPhone.</strong> So I decided to test the library whether it can send/receive its own UDP packets or not using 127.0.0.1 on iPhone, and the result is it works.</p>

<p>So I was wondering whether the UDP packets are being sent or not, so I used Wireshark to see my network activity.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/P1VdG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/P1VdG.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>

<p>In the iPhone program, I instruct my UDP program to connect to 192.168.99.11, which is my MacBook, using port 55555. The Java UDP program on my Macbook is being told that the remote ip to connect to is 192.168.99.13 (my iPhone) on port 55555. </p>

<p>On Wireshark, I can see that ICMP is telling me that the destination and port are unreachable from iPhone.</p>

<p>So does anybody know why iPhone blocks UDP packets? Or is there something I overlook?</p>
","What are some possible causes of iPhone rejecting UDP packet?","<java><iphone><network-programming><sockets><udp>","2010-02-20 16:31:27","2252","2304501","1","<p>Unless I'm missing something in understanding your question you have two client-style applications. Both try to connect to port 55555 on the other host. I have no idea how it works for you on single box.  </p>

<p>Let me describe normal client-server (a.k.a active/passive) scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>server creates UDP socket and <code>bind(2)</code>s it to known port (55555 in your example),
<li>server calls <code>recv(2)</code>-family function on the socket to accept data from clients,
<li>client creates UDP socket and calls <code>sendto(2)</code> function with destination address argument initialized with servers's IP address and that known port number.
<li>server returns from the <code>recv(2)</code> with the data from client,
<li>optionally client and server exchange more messages.
</ol>

<p>The key is that you need bound known port on the server side. Server, on the other hand, doesn't need to know address and port of the client, thus server is passive and client(s) is/are active. I should probably add that it's not uncommon for UDP applications to act as both clients and servers at the same time. It's just logically these are separate roles.</p>

<p>That out of the way, there could be a couple of reasons why you get ""ICMP port unreachable"" response:</p>

<ul>
<li>No process is bound to the port on the server machine (see point 1. above),
<li>A firewall on the server machine actively rejects packets sent to that port.
</ul>

<p>Hope this clears it a bit. Let me know if I grossly misunderstood what you are asking.</p>

"2303520","<p>I created a standard Java Project in Eclipse, placed a XML file in the <code>src</code> folder with the intent to grab it by <code>Class#getResourceAsStream()</code>, and I was baffled when Eclipse can't seem to locate the XML file in the classpath.

<p>Here's a screen which says it all:</p>

<p>It prints <code>null</code> for the <code>/test.xml</code> resource. The <code>Class#getResourceAsStream()</code> obviously doesn't make any difference.</p>

"2304808","<p>I'm trying to develop a view of a hierarchical tree in which the weight of each node is the actual number of children it has. A leaf node has weight 1.</p>

I'm not exactly sure how well the problem you want to solve maps to the file system example but this is how I would go along solving the file system case myself:</p>

<p>You start with a rectangle representing the root of the hard disk. 
You take all files and directories in the directory and give them a size.</p>

<ol>
<li>For files the size is the size of the file</li>
<li>For directories, the size is the the complete size of all files it contains (including all its subfolders, and their subfolders and so on). </li>
</ol>

<p>Now you try to cut this list into two as equally sized lists as possible. Now you cut the input rectangle into two rectangles that has the same size proportions as the two lists you cut the input files into. You should make the cut along the axis that is shorter of the input rectangles size to make sure you always have as quadratic as possible rectangles. Now you run the algorithm recursively on the two lists with their corresponding rectangle.</p>

<p>The base cases would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is only a single file in the list. You then fill the rectangle with the color of the file type. </li>
<li>There is a single directory in the list. For this case you run the algorithm recursively on the contents in the directory inside the rectangle.</li>
</ol>

<p>Choosing how to split the lists into two as equally sized parts as possible may not be trivial (is it a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">knapsack</a>?). A decent heuristic approach would probably be to sort the list in descending order and take the elements out of the list and put it in the currently smallest of the two resulting lists.</p>

<p>EDIT: The splitting problem is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_problem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">partition</a> and is a special case of knapsack.

<p>Sure, i do not literally add mapping attributes to CUSTOM data classes but that doesn't matter for the EdmSchemaAttribute since that one lives on the assembly level.</p>

</p>

<p>In my example you would click ""into"" the Organisation record card for Acme Corp Inc or ""into"" the details of the next appointment.</p>

<p>If we ignore, for the moment, how the user edits the Organisation or adds/removes an appointment, is it a sensible UI in Winforms to use blue &amp; underline to signify <strong><em>click here and i'll take you to a new screen</em></strong></p>

<p>As in:</p>

<pre><code>TextBox1.Font = New Font(""Blah"", 8.25!, FontStyle.Underline etc
TextBox1.ForeColor = Color.Blue
</code></pre>

<p>Not forgetting:</p>

<pre><code>TextBox1.Cursor = Cursors.Hand
</code></pre>

<p>This would be for a reasonably rich application (for example a CRM) where you have a lot of different kinds of screens and the user is navigating between all sorts of records. And you want to show the user that he can navigate between detail views, grids, children, parents, siblings etc.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>it's familiar to users and it's
obvious, without being obtrusive or
taking up any screen real estate </p></li>
<li><p>easy to implement</p></li>
<li><p>the often-used alternative (a button
with an icon or even just three dots
[...]) looks a bit old-fashioned,
doesn't work very well in grids, and
takes up space</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>with all the flexibility and control
you have in a Winforms front end, you
should be able to devise a smart ui
without needing to borrow from
browsers (maybe???)</p></li>
<li><p>these pseudo links won't behave as
true anchor tags (there won't be any
""visited"" [ie. turn me purple if I've
already been in here] or ""hover""
behaviour and no open-in-new-tab
features, without a lot of work) ... potentially annoying to users?</p></li>
<li><p>detracts from genuine hyperlinks (as
in email addresses etc) - these no
longer stand out as links ""out to 
the internet"" (to the browser, to
email client) ... very minor issue?</p></li>

<p>Also quite popular in enterprise applications.</p>

<p>Maybe consider changing the color, to, maybe brown or green, so that it doesn't immediately imply a native web link.</p>

<p>Also many web applications built with some event-driven frameworks (like ASP.NET WebForms, JSF etc.) heavily use links that do not link anywhere but invoke some server-side processing (basically an event handler). So it's not unusual use.</p>

","Texture coordinate mapping how to map coordinates of 4 triangles in a square to 4 triangles in a triangle","<vb.net><coordinates>","2010-02-22 10:46:36","1642","2311767","3","<p>Let's consider first the case of the triangle <code>a</code>. </p>

<p>Assuming that your origin is at point 5, the coordinates of points 1 and 2 are <code>(-x0, y0)</code> and <code>(x0, y0)</code>, we should have the following.</p>

<p>The mapping from the old coordinates <code>(x, y)</code> into new <code>(xnew, ynew)</code> must be linear. This means, we've got the following formulae with still undefined coefficients:</p>

<pre><code>xnew = A*x + B*y + C
ynew = D*x + E*y + F
</code></pre>

<p>How can we determine the coefficients? We've got three pairs of values: <code>(-x0, y0) -&gt; (-x0, y0)</code>, <code>(x0, y0) -&gt; (-x0/2, y0)</code> and <code>(0, 0) -&gt; (0, -y0)</code>. This gives us the following:</p>

<pre><code>-x0 = -A*x0 + B*y0 + C   (1)        -x0/2 = A*x0 + B*y0 + C   (3)
 y0 = -D*x0 + E*y0 + F   (2)         y0   = D*x0 + E*y0 + F   (4)

  0 =  A*0  + B*0  + C   (5)
-y0 =  D*0  + E*0  + F   (6)
</code></pre>

<p>Good so far. (5) gives us <code>C = 0</code>, (6) gives <code>F = -y0</code>. Adding (2) and (4) we get <code>2*y0 = 2*E*y0 + 2*(-y0)</code>, hence <code>E = 2</code>. Subtracting (2) and (4) we get <code>0 = 2*D*x0</code>, hence <code>D = 0</code>. Adding (1) and (2) and taking into account that <code>C = 0</code>, we get <code>-(3/4)*x0 = 2*B*y0</code>, hence <code>B = -3/4*x0/y0</code>. Lastly, subtracting (1) and (2) we get <code>x0/2 = 2*A*x0</code>, hence <code>A = 1/4</code>.</p>

<p>Now, we can write down the needed mapping:</p>

<pre><code>xnew = 0.25*x - 0.75*(x0/y0)*y
ynew = 2*y - y0
</code></pre>

<p>The same way, for triangle <code>c</code> we obtain:</p>

<pre><code>xnew = -0.25*x - 0.25*(x0/y0)*y
ynew = -2*y - y0

<p>Given a rectangle of width w and height h. and a coordinate x,y in that rectangle I would like to identify which triangle I am within.</p>

<p>i.e. the function should take parameters(x,y) and return a,b,c,d or a zero based number representing that triangle index i.e. (0=A,1=B,2=C,3=D) if they are in that order.</p>

<p>I think this would be something like >= the formula of the red line and >= the formula of the green line?</p>

<p>The idea is for each box to have a pretty header with a background similar to the above image. The closest I can get to anything like this using basic Swing components is adding a TitledBorder but this is nothing close to what I want.</p>

<p>I have experiment with JXTaskPane from SwingX, which is close:</p>

<p>And near perfect, except for the fact that it's collapsible and it doesn't appear possible to make it not collapsible.</p>

<p>Are there any obvious solutions I'm missing here? Otherwise I figure extending JPanel and creating a special header for it using a image for the background of the header.</p>

<p>Before I post the question here, I tried the following code:</p>

<p>In the index.html,</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%
     String user = (String) request.getParameter(""userVO"");
%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and also</p>

<pre><code>flashvars.userVO =  ""&lt;%= user %&gt;""; 
</code></pre>

<p>The result, I get:</p>

<p>&lt; user</p>

<p>Do you know why I can't get the correct data.  Thanks.</p>

<p>You will probably just need to adjust the index.html template to build the FlashVars param element.</p>

<p>You need to be sure you wait until the app has been loaded to access the flashVars.  </p>

<p><strong>Edit: 7 Mar</strong></p>

<p>Correct, in those examples they hard code the value. You need to edit your template so the value is set to the value of the template parameter.</p>

"2312635","<p>I'm creating the database for monitoring status of applications' functionalities. The logic is following:</p>

<p>Each application has its own, specific list of functionalities that I'm monitoring. Each functionality belongs to only one application. There is a Functionality table that has foreign key to Application</p>

<p>Each application runs on one or more machines. Each machine can run one or more applications. This is MTM connection, so there is ApplicationInstance table connection Applications with Machines.</p>

<p>The actual monitoring is about querying ApplicationInstance. If there is a problem, information about it goes to AppInstanceError table, wich holds foreign key to ApplicationInstance. If the query is successful, we get a list of statuses of each functionality. So we have a FunctionalityStatus table with foreign keys to ApplicationInstance &amp; Functionality. </p>

<p>I think this is kind of bad design - why do we have multiple reference to Application? What guarantees that both will point to the same Application? Or is there any way to ensure this?</p>

<p>So my proposition of fix is to connect FunctionalityStatus with foreign keys to Machines &amp; Functionality. But in this case they define ApplicationInstance so what is the guarantee of having ApplicationInstance for each pair? Shouldn't they be connected somehow? In the real world connection exists and is obvious, so is it OK not to have it in database?</p>

<p>Is there a ""propper way"" of solving this problem, or of ensuring connections invisible from data design?</p>

<p>To make it more clear I prepared design of DB that I have now:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/gLDsd.png"" alt=""DB design""></p>

<p>The only thing that is missing is a connection from FunctionalityStatus to Machine. I see two ways ow making such a connection:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add foreign key to ApplicationInstance - then my doubts are:

<ul>
<li>How to make sure that ApplicationId from Functionality is the same that one from ApplicationInstance?</li>
<li>Isn this data duplication really needed?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Add foreign key to Machine - and doubts:

<ul>
<li>Will there be a propper ApplicationInstance record for every FunctionalityStatus record?</li>
<li>If there is an obvious connection between ApplicationInstance and FunctionalityStatus (mentioned in first doubt) whu can't we see it in database?</li>
<li>Again data redundancy becouse all ApplicationInstance records are (or should be) visible in FunctionalityStatus table</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Or maybe the whole design is screwed up and I should figure out something totally else?</p>

"2315906","<h3>Short Version</h3>
<p>Is there a <strike>widget library (whether it be Borland's VCL, or some other library) available for Delphi that supports</strike> way to have windowless controls in Delphi? Or, is the notion of a windowed control so deep into Delphi that a) not only does none exist, but b) it would be near impossible to create one, without throwing away nearly everything the Delphi IDE has to offer?</p>
<h3>Long Version</h3>
<p>I know that <a href=""https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050211-00/?p=36473"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">windowless controls are not magic</a>. A windowless control can have input focus (e.g. Internet Explorer). Input focus is nothing more than drawing either:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms648398(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a blinking cursor</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa452969.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a dotted line around the perimeter</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb773289(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a slight blue tinge on a button</a></li>
</ul>
<p>and when the user begins mashing keys, reacting appropriately. You <em>know</em> the keystrokes are meant for <strong>that</strong> focused control, because that's the control has focus.</p>
<p>In the case of my (Windows®) window, I would have to know that my windowless child control (let's <em><strong>pretend</strong></em> it's a descendant of TGraphicControl) gets the keyboard events. So during my form's <code>OnKeyDown</code>, <code>OnChar</code>, <code>OnKeyUp</code>, I would need to pretend they are going to my windowless child control.</p>
<p>Which I can do, but it is a pain.</p>
<p>But then the user will probably want to use <kbd>Tab</kbd> navigation, and I'll have to somehow intercept Delphi's normal tab control order handling, and hook in myself to say that <strong>this thing</strong> is the next (and previous) in the tab order.</p>
<p>Which I can do, but it is a pain.</p>
<p>And then there's <code>ActiveControl</code>, which doesn't understand anything except <code>TWinControl</code>'s, so if Delphi ever tries to figure out who has focus, it will go insane. I'd like to have an alternative implementation of ActiveControl.</p>
<p>Which I can do, but it is a pain.</p>
<p>In other words: <strong>is this just too much work?</strong> I'm fighting everything that Delphi is, all so I can have a few dozen windowless controls accessible through keyboard input? The Delphi designers never contemplated using interactive windowless controls, and if I try now to work it in, I'll just get stuck in the <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887912/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hurtlocker</a>?</p>
<p>Delphi gave me the chance of aiding me willingly, but I have elected the way of pain.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some further explanation of <em>windowless controls</em> is needed.</p>
<p>Not every control you interact with has to be a windows control. It is quite possible to have focus on, and send keyboard input to, a control that is not a Windows window.</p>
<p>For example, nearly every control you see in an Internet Explorer browser window is a windowless control. In the following screenshot you can see an <strong>edit</strong> control, which you can type in, and a button which (in this screenshot) has focus:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/OKPmV.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/OKPmV.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></a></p>

<p>You can see the dotted focus rectangle, and the button is bluish (which on Windows indicates that it has focus).</p>
<p>If I were to press <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> while the <em>Google Search</em> button has focus, it would <strong>press</strong> the button. The reason this works is because Microsoft wrote an entire widget library of controls. These controls look and feel (almost) exactly like the regular common controls - they are very nearly exact clones of the Windows common controls, right down to the themes being applied.</p>
<p>Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome also use a widget library of controls. They don't use Microsoft's built-in windowed controls, but instead use a library of graphical, interactive, windowless <em>widgets</em>.</p>
<p>And if you have a suitable development environment, then the windowless widgets work just like &quot;normal&quot; windowed controls. GTK+ is a widget library, and Glade is an IDE that lets you layout controls in that widget library.</p>
<p>I don't know in what development environment Firefox, Chrome, or Blender were created in, but their widgets support windowless controls.</p>
<hr />
<p>So now onto my question.</p>
<p>Unless I'm mistaken, it appears to me that although Delphi supports a base <code>TControl</code>, (which has width, height, and can paint itself), it cannot receive keyboard focus. It seems to me that Borland never designed Delphi's VCL as a generic widget library. The only evidence I have to support this is that a Form's <code>ActiveControl</code> is a TWinControl:</p>
<pre><code>property ActiveControl: TWinControl;
</code></pre>
<p>That doesn't mean that Delphi could be, or must be, limited to windowed controls. The VCL widget library could be extended to support giving focus to windowless controls.</p>
<p>But perhaps Delphi already supports windowless controls, and I just don't realize it? Is there already an established mechanism in Delphi to support giving focus to <code>TControl</code>'s? But I'm a reasonably smart guy, and I'm pretty sure Delphi's VCL cannot do what other widget libraries can do.</p>
<p>Which then leads to another question: how much work would be be to subclass forms and such to support it? Is there someone else out there, perhaps someone on TeamB, who's much smarter than I, who has already tried it, and come to the conclusion that it's impossible?</p>
<p>I'm asking now, up front, if trying to add windowless control support is damn near impossible (i.e. futile) - so that I don't spend weeks on it for nothing. I'm trying to draw on the knowledge of a community of Delphi developers.</p>
","How to use windowless controls?","<delphi><windowless>","2010-02-23 03:24:57","2959","2319497","7","<p>It's futile to build windowless controls <strong>and</strong> fit them into Delphi's VCL framework.</p>

<p>You bring up Internet Explorer as an example. But in that case, it's entirely in charge of everything that resides on it. It has its own internal notion of what the active control is, but think about what it looks like from the outside: It's just one giant control. When you ask the OS what has focus, the single browser control has it, no matter which of the browser's subcontrols <em>appears</em> to have focus.</p>

<p>When you press Tab, it looks to the OS as though the browser has simply consumed a tab character, just like edit controls do. Edit controls move the cursor over a few spaces and add tab characters to their internal buffers; browser controls move the cursor to another region of the display.</p>

<p>You're thinking of doing all this on a Delphi TForm. Delphi forms already have a framework for managing the active control and handling keystrokes, and you're going to have to fight it all. If you want windowless controls, go the Internet Explorer route and <strong>build your own container control</strong> to hold them so that you can remain in charge of everything that happens inside it.</p>

<p>Your container can be a VCL control, but the things you put on it probably can't — they'll still be expecting to use the VCL focus- and keyboard-handling rules. Notice how you can't put ordinary Windows controls in Internet Explorer, either. Anything you put there needs to go through specific ActiveX interfaces. Maybe you'll need interfaces, too, or maybe you can just make your own set of control classes that descend from some special ancestor class you design to work with your container. Don't start with <code>TGraphicControl</code>; it's too entrenched in the VCL to be usable as the basis for your offshoot control library.</p>

<p>It will be a lot of work, but then again, so was Internet Explorer.</p>

"2320633","<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I'm a first year CS student and I work part time for my dad's small business. I don't have any experience in real world application development. I have written scripts in Python, some coursework in C, but nothing like this.</p>

<p>My dad has a small training business and currently all classes are scheduled, recorded and followed up via an external web application. There is an export/""reports"" feature but it is very generic and we need specific reports. We don't have access to the actual database to run the queries. I've been asked to set up a custom reporting system. </p>

<p>My idea is to create the generic CSV exports and import (probably with Python) them into a MySQL database hosted in the office every night, from where I can run the specific queries that are needed. I don't have experience in databases but understand the very basics. I've read a little about database creation and normal forms.</p>

<p>We may start having international clients soon, so I want the database to not explode if/when that happens. We also currently have a couple big corporations as clients, with different divisions (e.g. ACME parent company, ACME healthcare division, ACME bodycare division)</p>

<p>The schema I have come up with is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>From the client perspective:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Clients is the main table</li>
<li>Clients are linked to the department they work for

<ul>
<li>Departments can be scattered around a country: HR in London, Marketing in Swansea, etc.</li>
<li>Departments are linked to the division of a company</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Divisions are linked to the parent company  </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>From the classes perspective:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Sessions is the main table

<ul>
<li>A teacher is linked to each session</li>
<li>A statusid is given to each session. E.g. 0 - Completed, 1 - Cancelled</li>
<li>Sessions are grouped into ""packs"" of an arbitrary size</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each packs is assigned to a client</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>I ""designed"" (more like scribbled) the schema on a piece of paper, trying to keep it normalised to the 3rd form. I then plugged it into MySQL Workbench and it made it all pretty for me:<br> (<a href=""http://maian.org/img/schema.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">Click here for full-sized graphic</a>)</p>

<sub>(source: <a href=""http://maian.org/img/schema.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">maian.org</a>)</sub>  </p>

<h2>Example queries I'll be running</h2>

<ul>
<li>Which clients with credit still left are inactive (those without a class scheduled in the future)</li>
<li>What is the attendance rate per client/department/division (measured by the status id in each session)</li>
<li>How many classes has a teacher had in a month</li>
<li>Flag clients who have low attendance rate</li>
<li>Custom reports for HR departments with attendance rates of people in their division</li>
</ul>

<h1>Question(s)</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Is this overengineered or am I headed the right way?</strong></li>
<li>Will the need to join multiple tables for most queries result in a big performance hit?</li>
<li>I have added a 'lastsession' column to clients, as it is probably going to be a common query. Is this a good idea or should I keep the database strictly normalised?</li>
</ul>

<p>1) You're pretty much on target for someone who is approaching a problem like this for the first time.  I think the pointers from others on this question thus far pretty much cover it. Good job!</p>

<p>2 &amp; 3) The performance hit you will take will largely be dependent on having and optimizing the right indexes for your particular queries / procedures and more importantly the volume of records.  Unless you are talking about well over a million records in your main tables you seem to be on track to having a sufficiently mainstream design that performance will not be an issue on reasonable hardware.  </p>

<p>That said, and this relates to your question 3, with the start you have you probably shouldn't really be overly worried about performance or hyper-sensitivity to normalization orthodoxy here.  This is a reporting server you are building, not a transaction based application backend, which would have a much different profile with respect to the importance of performance or normalization.  A database backing a live signup and scheduling application has to be mindful of queries that take seconds to return data.  Not only does a report server function have more tolerance for complex and lengthy queries, but the strategies to improve performance are much different.  </p>

<p>For example, in a transaction based application environment your performance improvement options might include refactoring your stored procedures and table structures to the nth degree, or developing a caching strategy for small amounts of commonly requested data.  In a reporting environment you can certainly do this but you can have an even greater impact on performance by introducing a snapshot mechanism where a scheduled process runs and stores pre-configured reports and your users access the snapshot data with no stress on your db tier on a per request basis.</p>

<p>All of this is a long-winded rant to illustrate that what design principles and tricks you employ may differ given the role of the db you're creating.  I hope that's helpful.</p>

<ol>
<li>You haven't configured the provider correctly.</li>
<li>There is a limitation in your EF provider.</li>
</ol>
<p>SQL is generated by the provider. You can configure server-version-specific SQL generation via the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb896311.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ProviderManifestToken attribute in EDMX</a>. This is how you tell the provider not to use SQL features which older server versions don't support.</p>
<p>It's possible that some MySQL storage engines support SQL features which others do not. In this case, the provider would need to either use a common subset of features supported by most engines or use <code>ProviderManifestToken</code> to allow you to choose.</p>
<p>However, it's also possible that a buggy provider simply returns incorrect SQL. If this is the case then you must either find an update or avoid queries which touch the bug.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Based on @Devart's answer, it seems that this is a limitation of the provider, which is designed in due to limitations of MySQL. The EF will produce an ADO.NET canonical command tree. It is the provider's responsibility to translate this to SQL. If the EF returns a cross/outer apply node in the CCT, it seems that Devart has not found a way to translate this to SQL which MySQL can handle. So either MySQL is just not up to the task of supporting all EF queries, or someone who is a MySQL expert (not me!) needs to show Devart how to produce MySQL-compatible SQL which can properly return rows for the cross/outer apply CCT nodes.</p>

In your context, you're not modelling a physical 2D space but a conceptual space with tiles that have 6 neighbors. This can be modelled with square tiles arranged in columns with the odd colums shifted vertically by half the size of a square. I'll try an ASCII diagram:</p>

<pre><code> ___     ___     ___     
|   |___|   |___|   |___
|___|   |___|   |___|   |

    |___|   |___|   |___|

<p>You can see easily that each square has 6 neighbors (except the ones on the edges of course). This gets easily modeled as a 2D array of squares, and the rules to compute the coordinates of the square at at position (i, j), i being the row and j the column are quite simple:</p>

<p>if j is even: </p>

<pre><code>(i+1, j), (i-1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1), (i-1, j-1), (i+1, j-1)

<p>Things to take note of include:</p>

spare parts and hardcoding everything
would be impractical.</li>
<li>The layout was explicitly specified to be that way. The dynamic columns are placed in </li>

<p>between non-dynamic columns. (having problems with this.  AFAIK columns are automatically placed on the right side and there's no option to place them in between.</p>

Pounding my head on the keyboard didn't work after frustratingly trying to make the matrix work as I think it was intended to and Like separating it into three separate tables.  One for the totals. One for the dynamics and one for the fixed columns. (Two actually because one fixed column should be before and the others after the dynamic ones.) </p>

If you need some info more just ask. As far as dynamic columns for spear parts just do like this. Collect list of all possible parts for all ships that will be shown.Rdlc file is actually a xml file. You can open it with XmlDocument and generate as many column as you need. The you can pass the changed content of the XmlDocument directly to the report viewer.Adding column in xml is a little bit tricky. First create the rdlc report using designer, save and create copy the rdlc file with different name. Then open it again with designer and delete one column. Save and compare the two xml this will show you what you need to add in the xml in for new column. This way you will create the dynamic columns.The table you pass as datasource must to be created in such a way that it has all ship columns and column for every part.Every row in this table will be ship and only in the columns for the parts the ship has there will be values.This is for now if you need some more info just ask<br> Best Regarsd,<br>Iordan</p>

<p>Exact position depends on what toolbars are visible. You can use the <code>outer/innerWidth</code> and <code>outer/innerHeight</code> properties of the <code>window</code> object to approximate a little closer.</p>

<p>IE doesn't provide much in the way of window properties, but oddly enough, a click event object will provide you with the screen location of the click. So I suppose you could have a calibration page which asks the user to ""click the red dot"" and handle the event with</p>

<pre><code>function calibrate(event){
    var top = event.screenY;
    var left = event.screenX;
}

<p>Or possibly use the <code>mouseenter/leave</code> events using the coordinates of that event to calibrate. Though you'd have trouble determining if the mouse entered from the left, right, top, or bottom.</p>

<p>Of course, as soon as they move the screen you'll need to recalibrate.</p>

Suffice to say that pretty much all 3D rendering is done in terms of triangles, and if you didn't use a tool to generate a model that is already composed of triangles, you'll need to generate triangles from whatever data you have there. Triangulating either the black space or the white space is probably the best way to do it, yes. Then you can build up a mesh or vertex list from that, and render those triangles that way. The triangles in the list then also double up for collision detection purposes.</p>

<p>I doubt Irrlicht has anything for triangulation as it's quite specific to your game design and not a general approach most people would take.

"2346129","<p>This relates to both physical programming as well as Ruby running on a web server. I have an array of RGB leds, which is 5x5 so a total of 25 leds. They are numbered and individually addressable as such:</p>

<pre><code> 1   2   3   4   5

<p>Here is a photo:</p>

<p>As for the hardware (which really isn't important, because it works fine), the system consists of 25 <a href=""http://thingm.com/products/blinkm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BlinkM</a>'s, an <a href=""http://www.arduino.cc/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Arduino</a>, and some various cabling and connectors.</p>

<p>The led's are sent commands via serial with a command as such:</p>

<pre><code>@sp.write [""\x01"", led, ""\x04\x00"", ""c"", color]
</code></pre>

<p>Which writes the byte array out to serial using ruby's <a href=""http://github.com/hparra/ruby-serialport"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Serialport gem</a>, the variables ""led"" and ""color"" are substituted with the hex of each, so for example if I wanted to make led number 8 turn red, my output would read:</p>

<pre><code>@sp.write [""\x01"",""\x08"", ""\x04\x00"", ""c"", ""\xff\x00\x00""]
</code></pre>

<p>So far all of this works wonders, and I'm really happy with what I have, now my question relates pretty much to general mathematics and simple programming, but somehow the implementation goes over my head.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeBMQ4zCvNI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Here is a sample of such animation.</a> Mostly I'm interesting in how one could animate patterns using ruby here. I recall certain ""processing"" animation scripts, just looping over a function using the array as an object and affecting the elements of the array creating interesting animations just due to the mathematics of the output.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any idea on how I could get started with something like that? I'm currently able to affect the LED's one at a time with my script, and I can string them together with <code>sleep x</code> after each command and manually build animations, but how could I make one run indefinitely with some sort of procedural animation?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I really didn't describe the bytecode array in its entirety, here are what each part does:</p>

<pre><code>@sp.write [""\x01"", led, ""\x04\x00"", ""c"", color]
             ^      ^      ^   ^     ^    ^
             a      b      c   d     e    f

a. start byte (not important, tells serial that it is the start of a command)
b. hex for LED address, ex. `\x07` is led 7
c. length of command (starting at ""e"")
d. bytes to be read (always 0 in our case)
e. the ""fade to color"" command
f. the color we want to fade to in rrggbb hex format.

<p>The compound join in the first ON clause might improve the performance of the query - but it is quite possible that the optimizer would hoist the 'AND SD.CreatedDate = SD2.MaxDate' condition anyway, meaning you wouldn't spot any difference even if you examined the two query plans.  I'm not quite sure of the best way to indent the table expressions after the main FROM clause.</p>

<ol>

<pre><code>tabControl1.Region = new Region(tabControl1.DisplayRectangle);
</code></pre>

<p>To hide the Tabs.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, ""wire"" up your buttons to handle selecting the different TabPages in the TabControl. Obviously you could do this in a more elegant way than this :</p>

<pre><code>private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  tabControl1.SelectedTab = tabControl1.TabPages[0];
}

private void button2_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{

}

<p>Note : if you want to insert secondary Forms or UserControls into the TabPages of a TabControl : that's not a problem : of course simpler to use UserControls. Insert them into the Controls collection of each TabPage and set their 'Dock Property to 'DockStyle.Fill. </p>

An affine transform can always be decomposed into translations, rotations, shearing and scaling. They all map parallelograms into parallelograms, which your transform does not.</p>

<p>For your transform, it can be done in two steps. One to convert the square into a trapezoid.</p>

<pre><code>p1-----p2       p1-----p2
 |     |   --&gt;   |       \
p3-----p4       p3--------p4'
</code></pre>

<p>Another to the vertical direction. A naive transformation rule is</p>

<pre><code>                   y - c
x' = (x - p1.x) * ———————— + p1.x
                  p1.y - c
y' = y
</code></pre>

<p>where c is the y-coordinate of the intersection point of the lines joining p1 and p3, and p2 and p4.</p>

<p>Now notice the x*y factor in the transformation. This indicates such a transform is <em>not</em> linear. Therefore, CATransform3D cannot perform this as a 2D transform either. </p>

<p>However, the vector</p>

<pre><code>[x, y, z, w=1]
</code></pre>

<p>will be converted to the actual 3D vector</p>

<pre><code>(x/w, y/w, z/w)
</code></pre>

<p>before projection if CA follows usual 3D compute graphics rules, so you could ""cheat"" by using the transform</p>

<pre><code>[ P . . Q ] [ x ]   [ x' ]
[ . R . S ] [ y ] = [ y' ]
[ . . 1 . ] [ z ]   [ z' ]
[ . T . U ] [ 1 ]   [ w' ]
</code></pre>

<p>with appropriate P, Q, R, S, T, U that maps the 4 points to the expected locations. (6 unique coordinates and 6 variables should have exactly 1 solution most of the cases.)</p>

<p>When you have found these 6 constants, you can craft a <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iPhone/library/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CALayer_class/Introduction/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/c_ref/CATransform3D"" rel=""noreferrer"">CATransform3D</a>. Notice the structure definition is</p>

<pre><code>struct CATransform3D
   {
   CGFloat m11, m12, m13, m14;
   CGFloat m21, m22, m23, m24;
   CGFloat m31, m32, m33, m34;
   CGFloat m41, m42, m43, m44;
};
typedef struct CATransform3D CATransform3D;
</code></pre>

<p>So you can directly change the matrix elements, instead of relying on the CATransform3DMake functions. (You may need to perform a transpose due to convention of using row or column vectors.)</p>

<p>I am having problems with the UV co-ordinates. I am finding it impossible to come up with suitable UV values which will work for all  faces of the cube.</p>

<p>Take the following numbering as an example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://sites.google.com/site/agnelkurian/home/uv_blues.png"" alt=""Cube with UV Values""></p>

<p>UV is set to (0, 0) for vertex A. For all vertices diagonally opposite to A (on all three faces sharing A as a vertex), I am setting UV to (1, 1). Now the three faces which do not have A as a vertex end up having two vertices each which have a UV value of (1, 1). It is my understanding that this should not be the case.</p>

<p>What then is the solution?</p>

<p>To get around this problem duplicate the vertex position and assign each copy a unique UV coordinate. This will increase the number of vertices to 24 for a cube in the worst case (four per side). </p>

<p>This is btw what everyone does regardless if he's using OpenGL or DirectX. For a cube this may look like a lot of wasted memory, but in practice - with real world models - the amount of vertex duplication is not that high.</p>

"2356472","<p>Some months ago there was a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1519462/maximum-bipartite-graph-1-n-matching"">nice question</a> regarding a ""<strong>1:n matching problem</strong>"" and there seems to be no poly-time algorithm. </p>

<p>I would like to add constraints to find a maximum matching for the 1:n matching problem with a polynomial algorithm. I would like to say: ""For vertex A1 choose either {B1,B2,B5} or {B2,B3} if the vertices are not already taken from another A-vertex"" i.e. I would not allow all possible combinations.</p>

<p>This could be expressed if we introduce helper vertices H for each choice and substitute edges with trees => we get a problem similar to the ordinary bipartite matching. Every vertex of A or B can have only one edge in the matching. The edges to or from vertices in H are either all in the matching or none of them is present in the matching. Imagine the following tri-partite graph:</p>

<p><img src=""https://karussell.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/treematching.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Now define h_ij=""tree rooted that contains H_ij"" to express the matching easily:</p>

<ul>
<li>Then in the example M={h12,h22} would be one 'maximum' matching, although not all vertices from B are involved</li>
<li>The set {h12,h23} is not a matching because then B3 would have be choosen twice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Would this problem then be solvable in polynomial time? If yes, is there a polytime solution for the weighted (w(h_ij)) variant? If no, could you argue or even proof it for a ""simple-man"" like me or suggest other constraints to solve the 1:n matching problem?</p>

<p>E.g. could the graph transformed to a general graph which then could be solved with the weighted matching for general graphs? Or could <a href=""http://cis.poly.edu/suel/papers/branch.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">branchings</a> or even <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=mqGeSQ6dJycC&amp;pg=PA1006&amp;lpg=PA1006&amp;dq=matching+forest&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xOLSJ-dnPf&amp;sig=kMwwFRAejcLwxOUHj0tRXs9NZ3k&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QMaLS6SGHdLz_Aby5PXpBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=matching%20forest&amp;f=false"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">matching forests</a> help here?</p>

","""(1:k) Tree-Matching"" - Solvable in polynomial time?","<algorithm><graph><matching>","2010-03-01 14:35:35","862","2360143","1","<p>There is a difference between maximal and <em>maximum</em>. I have assumed you meant maximum for the below writeup.</p>

<p>You don't seem to have defined your problem very clearly, but if I have understood your intent correctly,  It seems like your problem is NP complete (and 'equivalent' to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_packing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Set Packing</a>).</p>

<p>We can assume that the allowed sets sizes is the same (k) for all A_i to find a [1:k] matching, as any other set size can be ignored. To find max k, we just run the algorithm for [1:k] for k = 1,2,3.. etc.</p>

<p>So your problem is (I think...):</p>

<p>Given m set families <code>F_i = {S_1i, .., S_n(i)i}</code> (|F_i| = size of F_i = n(i), need not be same as |F_j|), each set of size k, you have to find one set from each family (say S_i) such that</p>

<ul>
<li>S_i and S_j are disjoint for any i neq j.</li>
<li>number of  S_i's is maximum.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can show that it is NP-Complete for k=3 in two steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>The NP-Complete problem <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_packing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Set Packing</a> can be reduced it. This shows that it is NP-Hard.</li>
<li>Your problem is in NP and can be reduced to Set Packing. This and 1) implies your problem is NP-Complete. It also helps you leverage any approximation/randomized algorithms already existing for Set-Packing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Set Packing is the problem:</p>

<p>Given n sets S_1, S_2, ..., S_n, find the maximum number of pairwise disjoint sets among these. </p>

<p>This problem remains NP-Complete even if |S_1| = |S_2| = ... = |S_n| = 3 and is called the 3-Set packing problem.</p>

<p>We will use this to show that your problem is NP-Hard, by providing an easy reduction from 3-Set packing to your problem.</p>

<p>Given S_1, S_2, .., S_n  just form the families</p>

<p>F_i = {S_i}.</p>

<p>Now if your problem had a polynomial time solution, then we get a set of Sets {S_1, S_2, ..., S_r} such that</p>

<ul>
<li>S_i and S_j are disjoint</li>
<li>Number of S_i is maximum.</li>
</ul>

<p>This easy reduction gives us a solution to the 3-set Packing problem and thus your problem is NP-Hard.</p>

<p>To see that this problem is in NP, we reduce it to Set-Packing as follows:</p>

<p>Given F_i = {S_1i, S_2i, ..., S_ni}</p>

<p>we consider the sets T_ji = S_ji U {i} (i.e. we add an id of the family into the set itself) and run them through the Set-Packing algorithm. I will leave it to you to see why a solution to Set-Packing gives a solution to your problem.</p>

<hr>

<p>For a <em>maximal</em> solution, all you need is a greedy algorithm. Just keep picking up sets till you can pick no more. This would be polynomial time.</p>

"2358787","<p>I'm working on an ASP.NET WebForms CMS application, and having a bit of trouble solving a particular problem.  For a while now, I've had a menu on the side of the admin console that shows a list of the pages, links, etc that make up the sitemap.  Users could click on an entry, bringing up a flyout menu at the point of the mouse click.  This menu has options like update page, view page, delete page, etc.</p>

<p>I've been getting some feedback from my users that having to do multiple clicks to get to the update page is becoming tedious, especially when updating many pages at once.  What I would like to do is change my application around such that clicking on one of these menu items will open up the update page, and there can be additional options along the top of that page.</p>

<p>The problem is that since the menu of pages can be quite heavy, I don't want to simply navigate to an entirely new page, and I've already got existing and working functionality in individual aspx pages. What I would really like is to have ONLY the main portion of the page, which contains the updating controls, be updated when you click a menu item.  Here's a picture to give you an idea of what I'm working with:</p>

<p>So, I would like to have the user be able to click on an item in section #2 and have section #3 be updated with the update controls for that item.  I've looked into using a .NET AJAX UpdatePanel, but some controls that I need, such as validation controls, are not compatible with an UpdatePanel.</p>

<p>I need some ideas as to how to go about this.  What is the best method?  Has anyone done something like this before?  Ideally I would like to be able to preserve the existing pages that I've built, because I know that their logic works.</p>

<p>How to fix this? 
I can sort data, I can filter by entering single value, but cant filter by multiple values.
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>You also have to turn that option on for ODBC linked tables (This default setting is set so you don’t hurt yourself as you must realize for access to build that cute dialog is has to pull all reocrds).</p>

<p>I don’t have 2007 handy, but in 2010 there is a check box to ENABLE that dialog for ODBC sources. I quite sure that check option exists for 2007 also.</p>

<p>Just click on the office button, then access options (lower right), and then choose current database. Scroll down to the section called</p>

You see a set of check boxes:

[ ]  Local non indexed fields
[ ]  ODBC fields

<p>So, you can enable all 3, and again using this option on odbc, or no indexed columns will have have a cost in terms of performance. Looking at the above set of options, it’s pretty intelligently thought out.</p>

</code></pre>

<p><strong>some ideas</strong></p>

<p>You don't need to make all those temp tables, your function will return an in memory table which will not go to disk, should be faster.  For example</p>

<p>change</p>

<pre><code>INNER JOIN #TempRace tr ON 
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>INNER JOIN dbo.tfnParseStringIntoTable(@Race, ',') tr ON 
</code></pre>

<p>and remove all references to #TempRace.  You can do the same for #TempGender and #TempGrade</p>

<p>You can sometimes gain a lot of speed by selecting the main table's elements of interest before doing all the joins.  To see what I mean, try the following and see if it works:</p>

<pre><code>;WITH ser as
( SELECT DISTINCT
  *
 From 
  dbo.StuEnrlmt ser
 WHERE (ser.StuEsiRltnspExpctdSchlStartDate &lt;= @AsOfDate)
  AND ((ser.WithdrlDate IS NULL) OR (ser.WithdrlDate &gt;= @AsOfDate))
  AND ((spr.DeleteFlag IS NULL) OR (spr.DeleteFlag = 'N'))
  AND ((sdr.DeleetFlag IS NULL) OR (sdr.DeleetFlag = 'N'))
  AND ((ser.DeleteFlag IS NULL) OR (ser.DeleteFlag = 'N'))
)
--Main select replacing FROM dbo.StueEnrlmt with FROM ser
</code></pre>

<p>Also: You might want to join in the other elements in the where of the main select into this CTE so your main select has <strong>NO</strong> where clause (res, rsec, sdr, sglr, spr, spogr, selar), then you will be doing a lot of the slow stuff - that is case statements and joins only for records you are actually going to use.</p>

<p><strong>original before query code</strong></p>

<p>One thing to note is the estimated number of rows was 3 and the actual number of rows was 11601.</p>

<p>Also it says order by RaceCatg2Key -- are you joining to this table?  It might be ordering it so it can do the join.</p>

<p>If you show the whole query we might have some ways to speed it up.</p>

Still the same error. Maybe this is a common problem, with a small work-around?</p>

"2366884","<p>I want to create sparklines that illustrate the number of posts created on my blog in the last 2 weeks. To do this, I need to first generate an array that contains the number of posts created on each day during the period in question.</p>

<p>For example, this array:</p>

<pre><code>[40, 18, 0, 2, 39, 37, 22, 25, 30, 60, 36, 5, 2, 2]

<p>My question is how to create these arrays. Here's what I'm doing now: (I'm using <a href=""http://rdoc.info/projects/binarylogic/searchlogic"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Searchlogic</a> to do the queries, but it should be understandable even if you've never used it)</p>

<pre><code>  history = []
  14.downto(1) do |days_ago|
    history.push(Post.created_at_after((days_ago + 1).day.ago.beginning_of_day).created_at_before((days_ago - 1).days.ago.beginning_of_day).size)

<p>If you are working with Win-forms, my suggestion would be to create two Dialog windows.</p>

<p>One is for parent-objects(with a DGV) and another is for child-objects(with a DGV).</p>

<p>When the user opens the parent window, parent objects would be loaded row-wise in the DGV.</p>

<p>Then if the user double-clicks a row on the parent-window, the child-window would be shown up and the child objects of that parent would be populated on the DGV on the child window.</p>

<p>In this way you can keep things clean no matter how deep the parent-child relationships go. Moreover, add, edit, delete, etc. operations would be much cleaner.</p>

<p>You can also use some third-party controls like, <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/markrideout/archive/2006/01/08/customizing-the-datagridview-to-support-expanding-collapsing-ala-treegridview.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HierarchicalDataGridView</a>.</p>

I ran your repro project and checked out the call stack when the exception is thrown. It happens in DataGridCell.RemoveBindingExpressions during a call to VisualTreeHelper.IsAncestorOf. The latter method throws an exception when it is passed an object that is not Visual or Visual3D. But DataGridCell is passing it whatever element is the target of the binding. In your case that happens to be a Run which does not derive from Visual.</p>

<p>I was thinking you might be able to work around it by using an IValueConverter to create the FlowDocument and binding RichTextBox.Document so that the binding is being applied to the RichTextBox. But since Document isn't a dependency property, it can't be a target of binding.</p>

<p>So instead what you might want to do is create a UserControl that hosts the RichTextBox control:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;
    &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
        &lt;Local:HomeworkControl Text=""{Binding Homework}"" /&gt;
    &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
&lt;/DataGridTemplateColumn.CellTemplate&gt;

<p>Then in that user control you would take care of building the RichTextBox, document, run, etc. Unfortunately I think this is just a limitation (aka bug) in the DataGrid control.</p>

 - sepa (SEParator for Accessors)
 - sepp (SEParator for Properties)
 - sepc (SEParator for Constructors)
 - etc.</p>

<p>I also modified the standard ""new class"" template (Java -> Code Style -> Code Templates in Eclipse Preferences screen)</p>

<p>Also, there is an old Eclipse plugin called <a href=""http://themindstorms.blogspot.com/2006/11/my-eclipse-code-folding-plugin.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Coffee-bytes</a>, which enhanced the way Eclipse folds portions of code.
I don't know if it still works, but I remembed one could define arbitrary foldable zones by adding special comments, like // [SECTION] or something.
It might still work in recent Eclipse revisions, so take a look. </p>

"2381363","<p>I would like to do some exercice and apply DDD to my Domain Model applied to Northwind database. Even if Northwind is an example I imagine that it was done to satisfy some "" virtual business"" requirements. So the goal is to have a Domain Model that respects DDD and the data is stored in Northiwnd database.</p>

<p>Consider this EF persistance model :</p>

<li><p>How would you model agregates ?</p></li>
<li><p>How about Values Objects, services and factories if needed ?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know that probably I shoul look at business requirements and that look how the model should change but would like to have your advaice on that.</p>

<p>Don't hesitate to ask for details if my question is not clear.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
","Applying DDD to Northwind database","<architecture><domain-driven-design><ddd-repositories>","2010-03-04 17:28:23","1521","2388358","1","<p>In general I'm tempted to answer <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mu</a> (in the Zen sense), because the scenario is wrong from a DDD perspective. In DDD we start with business requirements and Domain experts and from those we derive a <strong>Domain Model</strong>.</p>

<p>Although it's a controversial point, the database is almost just an incidental artifact of the business requirements (that almost always state that Entities must be persisted).</p>

<p>That said, I'll try to do my best.</p>

<p>In most cases, an Order is a pretty important business object, and obviously we need to know about the order lines, including the Products in each line, so it would seem like we need the association from order line (Order_Detail) to Product.</p>

<p>However, when given a particular product, we rarely need to know in which orders it was included, so that suggests a one-way relationship right there. We can navigate from order line to product, but not from product to order lines.</p>

<p>However, the above analysis may turn out to be false on a deeper level. Imagine the following conversation between the developer and the domain expert:</p>

<p><strong>Dev:</strong> <em>We've created this association from orders to products so that we always know everything about the products in a particular order.</em></p>

<p><strong>Exp:</strong> <em>That sounds good, but what about the supplier?</em></p>

<p><strong>Dev:</strong> <em>That is included as well.</em></p>

<p><strong>Exp:</strong> <em>So what happens when we change the supplier for the product?</em></p>

<p><strong>Dev:</strong> <em>That will be implicitly reflected in the order data as well...</em></p>

<p><strong>Exp:</strong> <em>That's not what we want. We want the data to reflect the order at the time we shipped it.</em></p>

<p>In this case, it turns out that there's actually an error in the database schema. The problem may be caused by reporting, because business analysists may want to run reports on how different suppliers impact earnings (what do I know).</p>

<p>Such a case may suggest cutting the association from order lines to product altogether. Orders should hold historic (snapshot) product data, not current product data.</p>

<p>We may even entroduce a <code>ProductSnapshot</code> <strong>Value Object</strong> that semantically mirrors a <code>Product</code> <strong>Entity</strong> to model this in the Domain Model.</p>

<p>All in all, it seems more and more reasonable to model <code>Order</code> as an aggregate of itself and order lines (with <code>ProductSnapShots</code>), but what about the relationship between orders and customers?</p>

<p>As I currently understand associations and aggregates, <strong>associations define aggregates</strong>. Given an order, would we like to know about the customer? Most likely. Given a customer, would you like to know about the orders? Probably.</p>

<p>This suggests a two-way relationship, which makes <code>Customer</code> the <strong>Aggregate Root</strong>. This means that you would have a <code>CustomerRepository</code>, but no <code>OrderRepository</code>. Every time you need an Order, you must get it via a <code>Customer</code>.</p>

<p>In some cases this may make perfect sense, while this could be really clunky in other situations. It really depends on the business requirements...</p>

<p>You might consider creating an <code>OrderRepository</code> as well, but that invades the <code>Customer</code> Aggregate Root. If you do that, it becomes vague where the responsibility for the Order lies. What happens if you nagigate from Order to Customer? <code>Customer</code> has a list of Orders, but are they all populated in memory if you read the Order from the <code>OrderRepository</code>?</p>

<p>Probably not, but they are likely to be if you read the Customer from the <code>CustomerRepository</code>. The point here is that analysis of <strong>Aggregate Roots</strong> is important, and once you have defined an Aggregate, you will have to stick with it and respect it.</p>

<p>That causes me to <strong>favor small aggregates</strong> over big aggregates, so in this example, I would constrain the aggregate to <code>Order</code> and its order lines, and have no association between <code>Order</code> and <code>Customer</code>.</p>

<p>Not having a formal association between <code>Order</code> and <code>Customer</code> doesn't mean that we can't relate them at all, but we need explicit <strong>services</strong> to gives us all Orders for a given Customer. We can't just navigate from one to the other.</p>

"2381733","<p>I was watching the Superbowl and I was wondering how the digital ""Down Marker"" was being displayed on the live video feed.   Below is a screen show of the digital down marker which is a red line.  </p>

<p>Some behavior that I noticed is that the line is always displayed on the ""field"",  so if a player is standing on the line, you can see his feet as if he is standing on top of this line.  If the camera moves,  the line stays in a static position on the field.   All cameras recording the event see the same line,  even though they are in different vantage points.  </p>

<p>How would someone go about implementing this? What sensors would you use?  How would you correlate the data?  What libraries or development platforms are ideal for this problem?</p>

"2384955","<p>Looking for some implementation advice:</p>

<p>I have a page that has a 3-tab ajaxToolkit:TabContainer. The purpose of the page is to expose a calculator that has two basic inputs: geo-location and date. The three tabs are labeled ""City and State"", ""Postal Code"", and ""GPS Coordinates"". The layout of each tab container is the same for each tab, with the exception of the location section; the location section changes because each type of location has different inputs. For example, to specify city/state, there will be three fields: city, country, and state (country and state will use cascading drop-down lists). But Postal code requires only one field (which will validate via regular expression for allowed countries).</p>

<p>See the example design mockup:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/f8Ilr.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/f8Ilr.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>So, what I WOULD LIKE to do (in order to minimize duplicate code), is to have a common control that contains the layout and structure of the calculator without specifying anything about the location section. Then, I'd like to be able to pull in each of the unique location controls based on what tab is selected. The tab structure exists at the page level, not in a control.</p>

<p>Any advice?</p>

<p>I was looking at templated controls (see MSDN article <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/36574bf6(v=vs.140)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>), but I'm not convinced that it's the right solution. If I HAVE to create three separate controls with similar layouts and common elements, then that's what I have to do. But REALLY, I'd prefer a more elegant, inheritance-based solution.</p>

<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>The obvious answer is to set the TextView to fill_parent on height, but this causes no room to be left for the button or entry field.</p>

<p>Essentially the issue is that I want the submit button and the text entry to be a fixed height at the bottom and the text view to fill the rest of the space. Similarly, in the horizontal linear layout I want the submit button to wrap its content and for the text entry to fill the rest of the space.</p>

<p>If the first item in a linear layout is told to fill_parent it does exactly that, leaving no room for other items. How do I get an item which is first in a linear layout to fill all space apart from the minimum required by the rest of the items in the layout?</p>

<p>Before the introduction of ConstraintLayout the answer was a <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/relative.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">relative layout</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>If you have a relative layout that fills the whole screen you should be able to use <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RelativeLayout.LayoutParams.html#attr_android:layout_alignParentBottom"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>android:layout_alignParentBottom</code></a> to move the button to the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>If your views at the bottom are not shown in a relative layout then maybe the layout above it takes all the space. In this case you can put the view, that should be at the bottom, first in your layout file and position the rest of the layout above the views with <code>android:layout_above</code>. This enables the bottom view to take as much space as it needs, and the rest of the layout can fill all the rest of the screen.</p>

"2390314","<p>I could have sworn that I've used NUnit's Assert.Throws to determine whether or not a particular exception gets thrown from a method, but <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2388827/can-anyone-explain-why-dictionary-in-c-sharp-doesnt-work-like-mapt-u-in-stl"">my memory has failed me before</a>.

<p>I wrote unit tests to prove my lack of understanding in the use of Dictionary, and couldn't get it handle the KeyNotFoundException that gets thrown.  Instead of NUnit catching it and passing the test, I get an unhandled KeyNotFoundException error when I run.  I verified that I don't have the VS IDE set up to break on thrown .NET exceptions.</p>

<p>I've tried this two ways:</p>

<pre><code>Assert.Throws( typeof(KeyNotFoundException), () =&gt; value = prefs[""doesn't exist""]);

<p>Because you have specified a delegate, the exception is happening within the ""AnonymousMethod"" that was created. This is being called by the .Net framework. The debugger is stopping because your delegate isn't handling the exception before it gets passed back to the framework. It doesn't care that further up the stack it might be handled in your code (perhaps since there is no way to guarantee that the external code will handle the exception correctly.) </p>

<p>To have VisualStudio see this as a handled exception, use the ExpectedException attribute and remove the delegate, like so:</p>

I changed this to ""exact"" and entered a specific point size (e.g line spacing of 18 pt. for my 16 pt. text) and this seemed to solve the problem.  If the line spacing is too small it seems that Crystal masks off the bottom part of the text.</p>

"2390400","<p>I'm developing an augmented reality application for Android that uses the phone's camera to recognise the arrangement of the coloured squares on each face of a Rubik's Cube.</p>

<p>One thing that I am unsure about is how exactly I would go about detecting and recognising the coloured squares on each face of the cube. If you look at a Rubik's Cube then you can see that each square is one of six possible colours with a thin black border. This lead me to think that it should be relativly simply to detect a square, possibly using an existing marker detection API.</p>

<p>My question is really, has anybody here had any experience with image recognition and Android? Ideally I'd like to be able to implement and existing API, but it would be an interesting project to do from scratch if somebody could point me in the right direction to get started.</p>

<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Recognizing objects in photographs is an open AI problem.  So you'll need to constrain the problem quite a bit to get any traction on it.  I suggest starting with something like:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The cube will be photographed from a distance of exactly 12 inches, with a 100W light source directly behind the camera.    The cube will be set diagonally so it presents exactly 3 faces, with a corner in the center. The camera will be positioned so that it focuses directly on the cube corner in the center.</p></li>
<li><p>A picture will taken.  Then the cube will be turned 180 degrees vertically and horizontally, so that the other three faces are visible.  A second picture will be taken. Since you know exactly where each face is expected to be, grab a few pixels from each region, and assume that is the color of that square.  Remember that the cube will usually be scrambled, not uniform as shown in the picture here.  So you always have to look at 9*6 = 54 little squares to get the color of each one.</p></li>
<li><p>The information in those two pictures defines the cube configuration.  Generate an image of the cube in the same configuration, and allow the user to confirm or correct it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>It might be simpler to take 6 pictures - one of each face, and travel around the faces in well-defined order.   Remember that the center square of each face does not move, and defines the correct color for that face.</p>

<p>Once you have the configuration, you can use OpenGL operations to rotate the cube slices.  This will be a program with hundreds of lines of code to define and rotate the cube, plus whatever you do for image recognition.</p>

"2391672","<p>I am trying to find a fast algorithm with modest space requirements to solve the following problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>For each vertex of a DAG find the sum of its in-degree and out-degree <strong>in the DAG's transitive closure</strong>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given this DAG:</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Directed_acyclic_graph.png"" alt=""DAG from Wikipedia""></p>

<p>I expect the following result:</p>

<pre><code>Vertex #   Reacability Count  Reachable Vertices in closure
   7             5            (11, 8, 2, 9, 10)
   5             4            (11, 2, 9, 10)
   3             3            (8, 9, 10)
  11             5            (7, 5, 2, 9, 10)
   8             3            (7, 3, 9)

  10             4            (7, 5, 11, 3)
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to me that this should be possible without actually constructing the transitive closure.  I haven't been able to find anything on the net that exactly describes this problem.  I've got some ideas about how to do this, but I wanted to see what the SO crowd could come up with.</p>
","Finding the Reachability Count for all vertices of a DAG","<algorithm><graph-theory><directed-acyclic-graphs>","2010-03-06 07:08:08","5115","2422618","5","<p>I have constructed a viable solution to this question.  I base my solution on a modification of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sort"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">topological sorting</a> algorithm.  The algorithm below calculates only the in-degree in the transitive closure.  The out-degree can be computed in the same fashion with edges reversed and the two counts for each vertex summed to determine the final ""reachability count"".</p>

<pre><code>for each vertex V
   inCount[V] = inDegree(V)   // inDegree() is O(1)
   if inCount[V] == 0
      pending.addTail(V)

while pending not empty
   process(pending.removeHead())

function process(V)
   for each edge (V, V2)
      predecessors[V2].add(predecessors[V])   // probably O(|predecessors[V]|)
      predecessors[V2].add(V)
      inCount[V2] -= 1
      if inCount[V2] == 0
          pending.add(V2)
   count[V] = sizeof(predecessors[V])         // store final answer for V
   predecessors[V] = EMPTY                    // save some memory
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming that the set operations are O(1), this algorithm runs in O(|V| + |E|).  It is more likely, however, that the set union operation <code>predecessors[V2].add(predecessors[V])</code> makes it somewhat worse.  The additional steps required by the set unions depends on the shape of the DAG.  I believe the worst case is O(|V|^2 + |E|).  In my tests this algorithm has shown better performance than any other I have tried so far.</p>

<p>Furthermore, by disposing of predecessor sets for fully processed vertices, this algorithm will typically use less memory than most alternatives.  It is true, however, that the worst case memory consumption of the above algorithm matches that of constructing the transitive closure, but that will not be true for most DAGs.</p>

"2399134","<p>i think this not a specific problem to me; everybody might have encountered this issue before.
To properly illustrate it, here's a simple UI:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/QkzUF.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/QkzUF.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>As you can see, those two spinners are controlling a single variable -- ""A"". The only difference is that they control it using different views.</p>

<p>Since these two spinners' displaying values are synchronized, cyclic event shows up.</p>

<p>If i change the top spinner, ""A"" will be changed and the bottom spinner's value will also be updated accordingly. <strong>However</strong>, updating the bottom spinner's call (such as setValue) will also trigger another event instructing the top spinner to update based on the bottom spinner's value. Thus creates a bad cycle which can eventually cause a StackOverFlow exception.</p>

<p><em>My previously solution is kinda cumbersome: i placed a guarding boolean to indicate whether the 2nd updating call should be performed.</em></p>

<p>Now i'd like to ask ""<strong>how can i handle such situation elegantly?</strong> ( <strong>in general, not specific to spinners</strong> )""</p>

<p><em>thx</em></p>

<hr>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>Since i've got 2 answers suggesting me to utilize the observer structure, i have to say something about it.</p>

<p>Like what i've said, it's great but far from being perfect. Not only because of its inherent complexity, but also <strong>Its inability to solve the problem</strong>.</p>

<p>Why? To see the reason, you must realize the <em>tight coupling</em> of the View and Model-Controller in Java Swing. Lets take my spinner UI for an example. Suppose the variable A is actually an Observer object. Then, after firing the first state change event from the top spinner, the Observer ""A"" will update its value and fire a PropertyChange event to notify the bottom spinner. Then comes the 2nd updating which updates the bottom spinner's View. <em>However</em>, changing bottom spinner's view inevitably triggers a redundant event that will try to set ""A""'s value again. Afterwards, the deadly loop is fully constructed and the stack overflow will be thrown.</p>

<p>In theory, the Observer model tries to solve the direct cycle by introducing 2 independent feedback paths. The chained updating odds(in event-response codes) implicitly form a bridge connecting both paths, making a cycle again.</p>
","The Elegant way to handle Cyclic Event in Java?","<java><swing><events><awt><cyclic>","2010-03-08 03:31:59","2525","2406293","9","<p>Going back to Model-View-Controller, think about what your Model is, and what your View is.</p>

<p>In your current implementation, you have two models (one for each Spinner control), and they're being synced through the View layer.</p>

<p>What you should be doing though is share the same backing model. For the spinner with a subtracted value, create a proxy to the original model. ie:</p>

<pre><code>class ProxySpinnerModel implements SpinnerModel {
    getValue() { return originalSpinner.getValue() - 10 }
    setValue(v) { originalSpinner.setValue(v+10) }
}

spinnerA = new JSpinner()
spinnerB = new JSpinner( new ProxySpinnerModel( spinnerA.getModel() ) )
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you don't need to add listeners, since they're both working off the same model and the default implementation (the originalModel) already has change listeners which it fires to the view.</p>

"2418272","<p>i have bit of code that causes an underflow:</p>

<pre><code>var
    t1, t2, delta: DWORD:
begin
   t1 := 0xffffff00;
   t2 := 0x00000037;

   delta := (t2 - t1);
</code></pre>

<p>The subtraction itself <em>does</em> generate an overflow (underflow), but i don't want Delphi to throw an <code>EIntOverflow</code> exception. So i try disabling the generation of overflow checking code by disabling overflow checking:</p>

<pre><code>var
    t1, t2, delta: DWORD:
begin
   t1 := 0xffffff00;
   t2 := 0x00000037;

{$OVERFLOWCHECKS OFF}
   delta := (t2 - t1);
{$OVERFLOWCHECKS ON}
</code></pre>

<p>Yet even with the <code>OVERFLOWCHECKS OFF</code> option, it still throws an exception. And the generated code still contains the check:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/ytGgY.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ytGgY.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>A reminder of the documentation on <code>$Q</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Overflow checking</strong></p>
  
  <p><strong>Type</strong> Switch<br>
  <strong>Syntax</strong> {$Q+} or {$Q-}<br>
      {$OVERFLOWCHECKS ON} or {$OVERFLOWCHECKS OFF}<br>
  <strong>Default</strong> {$Q-}<br>
            {$OVERFLOWCHECKS OFF}<br>
  <strong>Scope</strong> Local  </p>
  
  <p><strong>Remarks</strong>  </p>
  
  <p>The $Q directive controls the
  generation of overflow checking code.
  In the {$Q+} state, certain integer
  arithmetic operations (+, -, *, Abs,
  Sqr, Succ, Pred, <em>Inc</em>, and <em>Dec</em>) are
  checked for overflow. The code for
  each of these integer arithmetic
  operations is followed by additional
  code that verifies that the result is
  within the supported range. If an
  overflow check fails, an EIntOverflow
  exception is raised (or the program is
  terminated if exception handling is
  not enabled).</p>
  
  <p>The $Q switch is usually used in
  conjunction with the $R switch, which
  enables and disables the generation of
  range-checking code. Enabling overflow
  checking slows down your program and
  makes it somewhat larger, so use {$Q+}
  only for debugging.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do i use <code>$OVERFLOWCHECKS OFF</code> to disable the generation of overflow checking code?</p>

<hr>

<p>Mason's answer worked. The revised code is:</p>

<pre><code>var
    t1, t2, delta: DWORD:
begin
   t1 := 0xffffff00;
   t2 := 0x00000037;

   delta := Subtract(t2, t1);


{$OVERFLOWCHECKS OFF}
function Subtract(const B, A: DWORD): DWORD; //subtract B-A
begin
   {
      Disabling overflow checking does not work at the line level,
      only the routine level. 
      Hence the function to subtract two numbers.
   }
   Result := (B-A);
end;
{$OVERFLOWCHECKS ON}
</code></pre>

"2421701","<p>I recently upgraded to using ReSharper 5 (currently in beta). I noticed that in ASP.Net MVC projects, ReSharper underlines in red all of the return statements inside a controller:</p>

<p>I personally find this pretty annoying because it looks like an error. Clicking on the underlined text doesn't offer any help (ie, a lightbulb). I don't see an option to change the styling of this text in <code>Environment -&gt; Fonts and Colors</code>, and so far it looks like the only way to disable it is to un-check the ""Enable ASP.Net MVC References"" in the <code>ASP.Net -&gt; Other</code> Re-Sharper options.</p>

"2421717","<p>I 'm relatively new to git and and having some problems early on. I've made several commits, but when I try to push them I get a response that says everything is up-to-date. I feel like my problem is the same on listed in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/999907/git-push-says-everything-up-to-date-even-though-i-have-local-changes"">this question</a>, but it recommends the following:</p>

","What will git checkout master + git reset --hard do?","<git><branch>","2010-03-11 00:24:01","11091","2421802","2","<p>Checking out a branch moves the local <code>HEAD</code> pointer so that it's pointing at the same commit that the branch references.  For example:</p>

<p>When on branch <code>mybranch</code> (the <code>C</code>s are commits):</p>

<pre><code>                        HEAD
                        |
                        V
            master      mybranch
            |           |
            V           V
C1 -------&gt; C2 -------&gt; C3
</code></pre>

<p>After running <code>git checkout master</code>:</p>

<pre><code>            HEAD
            |
            V
            master      mybranch
            |           |
            V           V
C1 -------&gt; C2 -------&gt; C3
</code></pre>

<p>This also moves files in your working directory as required so that it is a perfect snapshot of what the project looked like at that commit. It does not delete or alter commits, so you won't lose work in one branch by checking out another.</p>

<p>What has happened in the case of a ""detached head"" as described in that other question is that <code>C3</code> is not associated with a branch. In order to fix this, you need to update the commit that the <code>master</code> branch points to so that it includes the new stuff (<code>C3</code>). Checking out <code>master</code> tells git that you are now working with the master branch, then doing a hard <code>reset</code> with the SHA1 of the commit that you <em>want</em> to be at the tip of your <code>master</code> branch updates the branch references to what you want.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>In this case, a detached head was not the issue. Just remember that committing and pushing are two different things in git. Committing does not communicate with a central repository like it does in Subversion. After you make changes to your working directory, you run <code>git add filename</code> once for each file you've changed, where <code>filename</code> is the name of the file. Once all the files have been added to the index, you commit them with <code>git commit</code>.</p>

<p>A shorthand for this is to use <code>git commit -a</code> which will automatically add modified files to the index before committing. This allows you to skip the <code>git add</code> steps. Note that <code>git commit -a</code> will only add <em>modified</em> files. If you're introducing a new file that has never been committed, you must manually add it with <code>git add</code>.</p>

<p>Once your commit has been made, you can run <code>git push</code> to send that commit to your remote repository and update the remote branches. This only does the remote communication stuff. Unlike Subversion, the commit itself is handled locally, without any interaction with the server.</p>

<p>Sure enough, casting the <code>CGRect</code> values to <code>int</code> for the view's frame worked perfectly. So as an example, if you wanted your text field to be centered vertically in the superview, you should use an <code>int</code> cast like this:</p>

<pre><code>textFieldWidth = 300;
textFieldHeight = 31;
offsetX = 0;
offsetY = (superview.bounds.size.height - textFieldHeight) / 2;

<p>Like what you see, the container does not fit the content except if the squares are positioned in Relative, is there a solution for this?</p>

"2433555","<p>I'm curious if anyone knows of a way to easily get a double border effect in WPF similar to what you see in the selected items in Windows Explorer in Windows 7.</p>

<p><img src=""https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4058/4426553847_74ece107fb_o_d.png"" alt=""Example of what I&#39;m looking for""></p>

<p>If you look closely, you'll notice that the selected item has a dark border, a lighter, inner-border, and then a gradient background.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm using two borders around an object any time I want to achieve this effect. Doing it that way is ugly syntactically and really muddies my view xaml. Being a web developer at heart I'd like to separate the xaml structure from the style as much as possible. So, I've started putting this into Styles and Content Templates in order to pull it out of my view xaml.</p>

<p>However, I'm curious if there may be a better way to go about this. </p>

<p>I played around for a while using a VisualBrush as a background to try to get the effect. However, I want to be able to apply the background to elements that can be any size and the way the VisualBrush stretched the visual to fit the element background didn't work the way I wanted it to. Essentially, I'd really just like it to stretch the visual the way the WPF layout system would do it.</p>

<p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>

","Double Border with a VisualBrush in WPF","<wpf><visualbrush>","2010-03-12 15:00:50","4658","2433823","1","<p>A VisualBrush is probably not what you want to do in this scenario, as it's pretty heavy.</p>

<p>You can solve the problem with some Xaml without nesting borders.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Border BorderBrush=""#FF00B5C5"" BorderThickness=""1"" CornerRadius=""2"" Background=""White""&gt;
   &lt;Grid Background=""#FF00B5C5"" Margin=""1""&gt;
     &lt;Rectangle Fill=""#FFA2F2FE"" /&gt;
     &lt;TextBlock Text=""This is some text"" VerticalAlignment=""Center""/&gt;
   &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/Border&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can, of course, tweak the properties to get the look you need.</p>

<p>EDIT: If you want to create a style, so you can reskin the look-and-feel, you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window.Resources&gt;
    &lt;Style x:Key=""BorderedTextBlock"" TargetType=""ContentControl""&gt;
        &lt;Setter Property=""ContentTemplate""&gt;
            &lt;Setter.Value&gt;
                &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
                    &lt;Border BorderBrush=""#FF00B5C5"" BorderThickness=""1"" CornerRadius=""2"" Background=""White""&gt; 
                       &lt;Grid Background=""#FF00B5C5"" Margin=""1""&gt; 
                         &lt;Rectangle Fill=""#FFA2F2FE"" /&gt; 
                         &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding}"" VerticalAlignment=""Center""/&gt;

                    &lt;/Border&gt;
                &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;/Setter.Value&gt;
        &lt;/Setter&gt;
    &lt;/Style&gt;
&lt;/Window.Resources&gt;

&lt;Grid x:Name=""LayoutRoot""&gt;
    &lt;ContentControl Style=""{StaticResource BorderedTextBlock}"" Content=""This is some text"" Width=""200"" Height=""24""/&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Additionally, turn this into a custom control with all the styling and theming parameters that you need.</p>

<p>1) Leaf and Composite usually implement one interface or one abstract class. In your diagram they extend Component. So, the relation on your diagram is <strong>inheritance</strong>.</p>

<p>2) Composite contains instances of Component. Component, as it occasionally can be Composite, can also contain instances of Component. This is called <em>recursive composition</em>. In general, the relation is called <strong>aggregation</strong>.</p>

I'm trying the arduous task of removing/re-adding elements until it displays, but any insight into what could cause this would help.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: it appears to be something related to the DotLess stylesheet.  The resulting CSS is valid according to the W3C CSS validator.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>:  Digging further, and making use of IE's Developer Tools to control the styles, it appears that IE is reading a single statement twice even though it only occurs once in the output.  Here's the output of the Less file:</p>

<p>Notice the <code>#newsfeed div .newFeatures</code> identifier near the end.  I don't know what's causing that as it's only appearing once in the output stream.

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong>: It appears that even though it duplicates that particular selector, if I change the <code>font-size</code> to a whole number like <code>61%</code> instead of the current <code>60.95%</code> (that specific to defaultly match the existing desktop app as closely as possible) it works fine.  I even moved the font-size (still as <code>60.95%</code>) to a more general selector (just the <code>.newFeature</code> one a few lines up) and it still causes the page to break.  Still not sure why that is.  I've added the full HTML to see what's going on.</p>

If you can get a sample up which shows the problem, that would be a big help.</p>
<p>Have you tried using the Developer Tools to see and manipulate the structure of the page? That's the first place to start when you get weird rendering issues for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>EDIT: Okay, this is really a tough one. Here's what I've been able to come up with.</p>
<p>For starters, I don't see the multiple defintion issue here, even though I copied all of that CSS into a file - so I can't really tell you what's going on there.</p>
<p>Secondly, it would appear that the problem is not specifically the 60.95% - it does the same if you use 60%, or 60.XX%. 61% works, 60.99 doesn't, 59.99% works, 60% doesn't.</p>
<p>However, it DOES render the page if I remove overflow-y: scroll. In fact, it works if I remove ANY of the definitions on <code>.newFeatures</code> or <code>#newsfeed div .newFeatures</code>. I can also change them to something else, and it works - except for max-height. Just changing one of the two margins on <code>#newsfeed div .newFeatures</code> to 0.999em makes the page render again. I propose doing that as a temporary workaround - or moving to 61% font-size, since there's very little difference.</p>
<p>It's really hard to tell what's going on here, but it looks like there's a bug in IE which causes some internal calculation to go horribly wrong in this particular scenario - and somehow the browser doesn't recover from it.</p>
<p>I think this is definitely something the IE team would like to know about now, so there's a chance they can fix it for IE9. This is a pretty isolated case, and probably not something currently covered by their testing. I'm not sure what the best way of contacting them are - there are some MSFTs on here, including <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/126229/ericlaw-msft"">Eric Law</a>, who might know of a better option than opening a support case.</p>

"2434862","<p>I'm going through exercises of a C++ book. For each exercise I want to minimize the boilerplate code I have to write. I've set up my project a certain way but it doesn't seem right, and requires too many changes.</p>

<p>Right now I have a single <code>main.cpp</code> file with the following:</p>

<pre><code>#include ""e0614.h""
int main()
{
    E0614 ex;
    ex.solve();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Each time I create a new class from an exercise, I have to come and modify this file to change the name of the included header as well as the class i'm instantiating.</p>

<p><strong>So my questions are:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Can I include all headers in the directory so at least I don't have to change the <code>#include</code> line?</li>
<li>Better yet, can I rewrite my solution so that I don't even have to touch <code>main.cpp</code>, without having one file with all the code for every exercise in it?</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>I ended up following Poita_'s advice to <strong>generate main.cpp via a script</strong>.</p>

<p>Since I'm using an IDE (Visual Studio), I wanted this integrated with it, so did a bit of research on how. For those interested in how, read on (it was fairly, but not entirely, straightforward).</p>

<p>Visual Studio lets you use an external tool via the Tools -> External Tools menu, and contains a bunch of pre-defined variables, such as <code>$(ItemFileName</code>), which can be passed on to the tool. So in this instance I used a simple batch file, and it gets passed the name of the currently selected file in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>To add that tool to the toolbar, right click on the toolbar, select Customize -> Commands -> Tools, and select the ""External Command X"" and drag it to the toolbar. Substitute X with the number corresponding to the tool you created. My installation contained 5 default pre-existing tools listed in Tools -> External Tools, so the one I created was tool number 6. You have to figure out this number as it is not shown. You can then assign an icon to the shortcut (it's the BuildMain command shown below):</p>

<p>Yes, you can if you monkey-patch autocomplete.</p>

<p>In the autocomplete widget included in v1.8rc3 of jQuery UI, the popup of suggestions is created in the _renderMenu function of the autocomplete widget.  This function is defined like this: </p>

<pre><code>_renderMenu: function( ul, items ) {
    var self = this;
    $.each( items, function( index, item ) {
        self._renderItem( ul, item );
    });
},
</code></pre>

<p>The _renderItem function is defined like this: </p>

<pre><code>_renderItem: function( ul, item) {
    return $( ""&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"" )
        .data( ""item.autocomplete"", item )
        .append( ""&lt;a&gt;"" + item.label + ""&lt;/a&gt;"" )
        .appendTo( ul );
},
</code></pre>

<p>So what you need to do is replace that _renderItem fn with your own creation that produces the desired effect.  This technique, redefining an internal function in a library, I have come to learn is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch"" rel=""noreferrer""><em>monkey-patching</em></a>.  Here's how I did it: </p>

<pre><code>  function monkeyPatchAutocomplete() {

      // don't really need this, but in case I did, I could store it and chain
      var oldFn = $.ui.autocomplete.prototype._renderItem;

      $.ui.autocomplete.prototype._renderItem = function( ul, item) {
          var re = new RegExp(""^"" + this.term) ;
          var t = item.label.replace(re,""&lt;span style='font-weight:bold;color:Blue;'&gt;"" + 
                  this.term + 
                  ""&lt;/span&gt;"");
          return $( ""&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"" )
              .data( ""item.autocomplete"", item )
              .append( ""&lt;a&gt;"" + t + ""&lt;/a&gt;"" )
              .appendTo( ul );
      };
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Call that function once in <code>$(document).ready(...)</code> .</p>

<p>Now, this is a hack, because: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>there's a regexp obj created for every item rendered in the list.  That regexp obj ought to be re-used for all items. </p></li>
<li><p>there's no css class used for the formatting of the completed part.  It's an inline style.<br>
This means if you had multiple autocompletes on the same page, they'd all get the same treatment. A css style would solve that.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>...but it illustrates the main technique, and it works for your basic requirements. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/LGkc8.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>updated working example: <a href=""http://output.jsbin.com/qixaxinuhe"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://output.jsbin.com/qixaxinuhe</a></p>

<hr>

<p>To preserve the case of the match strings, as opposed to using the case of the typed characters, use this line: </p>

<pre><code>var t = item.label.replace(re,""&lt;span style='font-weight:bold;color:Blue;'&gt;"" + 
          ""$&amp;"" + 
          ""&lt;/span&gt;"");
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, starting from the original code above, you just need to replace <code>this.term</code> with <code>""$&amp;""</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong><br>
The above changes <em>every</em> autocomplete widget on the page. If you want to change only one, see this question:<br>

"2436636","<p>So we have this product, and it's really slow in IE.
We've already applied a lot of the practices advised by the IE guys themselves (<a href=""https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2006/08/28/ie-javascript-performance-recommendations-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">like this</a>, and <a href=""https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ie/2007/01/04/iejscript-performance-recommendations-part-3-javascript-code-inefficiencies/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>), and try to sacrifice clean code for performance in the critical parts like DOM manipulation.</p>

<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/nGaRi.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/nGaRi.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>Just ""String"" is the biggest offender. Almost 750ms of exclusive time.</p>

<p>Does this mean IE is spending 750ms just instantiating Strings? I also read this stuff on the <a href=""https://dev.opera.com/articles/javascript-best-practices/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Opera dev blog</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A build script can remove whitespace,
  comments, replace strings with Array
  lookups (to avoid MSIE creating a
  string object for every single
  instance of a string — even in
  conditions)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But no more info regarding this. Anyone can clarify? It seems like IE has to create a full String instance every time you have  "" "" in your code, which could explain this, but I don't  know what the array lookup optimization would look like.
BTW- we don't really do much of string concatenation anywhere in the code.</p>

<p>The library we use is MooTools 1.2.4 </p>

<p>Any suggestions will be appreciated! Thx</p>

<p>UPDATE- I'm particularly interested in the tip mentioned above about ""array lookup optimization"". Our library is big (1MB) so it has a lot of strings in it, like any other JS code. But since our library is bigger than most, these Strings are actually causing speed issues. </p>

<p>Also, does anybody know if adding stuff to the String.prototype makes every instance slower?</p>

<p>When I start the application I get 3 txt.Info objects displayed and if I click any of them, 2 or even all of them get selected aswell.

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/KiesT.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/KiesT.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>

<p>As you can see, after the last item, the pattern stops.</p>
","Continue WPF gridview alteration","<wpf><gridview>","2010-03-13 19:48:27","582","2487254","1","<p>Yes, WPF provides a rather elegant way to implement this because its templating mechanism allows you to fill the unused area in a <code>GridView</code> with whatever you like.</p>

<p>All you need to do is modify the <code>ListView</code> template to paint the unused section of the with a <code>VisualBrush</code> that typically consists of two <code>GridViewItems</code> stacked vertically (in the general case it will be <code>AlternationCount</code> <code>GridViewItems</code>).</p>

<p>The only complexity is choosing which color to start with when painting the unused section of the <code>ScrollViewer</code>.  This is calculated as <code>Items.Count</code> modulo <code>AlternationCount</code>.  The solution is to create a simple <code>Control</code> that does this calculation and use it in our <code>ListView</code> template.  For the sake of my explanation I will call the control ""ContinueAlternation"".</p>

<p>The <code>ListView</code> template which would be mostly the default template with a <code>local:ContinueAlternation</code> control added below the <code>ScrollViewer</code> using a <code>DockPanel</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ControlTemplate TargetType=""{x:Type ListView}""&gt;
  &lt;Border BorderThickness=""{TemplateBinding BorderThickness}""
          BorderBrush=""{TemplateBinding BorderBrush}""
          Background=""{TemplateBinding Background}""
          SnapsToDevicePixels=""True""&gt;
    &lt;DockPanel&gt;
      &lt;ScrollViewer DockPanel.Dock=""Top""
                    Style=""{DynamicResource {x:Static GridView.GridViewScrollViewerStyleKey}}""
                    Padding=""{TemplateBinding Padding}""&gt;
        &lt;ItemsPresenter SnapsToDevicePixels=""True"" /&gt;
      &lt;/ScrollViewer&gt;

      &lt;local:ContinueAlternation
        ItemContainerStyle=""{TemplateBinding ItemContainerStyle}""
        AlternationCount=""{TemplateBinding AlternationCount}""
        ItemsCount=""{Binding Items.Count,
                          RelativeSource={RelativeSource TemplatedParent}}"" /&gt;

    &lt;/DockPanel&gt;
  &lt;/Border&gt;
&lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>ContinueAlternation</code> control will be displayed as a <code>Rectangle</code> painted with a tiled <code>VisualBrush</code> containing an <code>ItemsControl</code> that shows dummy rows, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ControlTemplate TargetType=""{x:Type local:ContinueAlternation}""&gt;
  &lt;Rectangle&gt;
    &lt;Rectangle.Fill&gt;

      &lt;VisualBrush TileMode=""Tile"" Stretch=""None""
                   ViewPortUnits=""Absolute""
                   ViewPort=""{TemplateBinding ViewportSize}""&gt;

        &lt;ItemsControl x:Name=""PART_ItemsControl""
                      ItemsSource=""{Binding}"" /&gt;
      &lt;/VisualBrush&gt;
    &lt;/Rectangle.Fill&gt;
  &lt;/Rectangle&gt;
&lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>DataContext</code> here will be an array of dummy <code>ListViewItem</code> generated in code-behind from the given <code>AlternationCount</code> and <code>ItemsCount</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public class ContinueAlternation
{
  public Style ItemsContainerStyle ... // Declare as DependencyProperty using propdp snippet
  public int AlternationCount ... // Declare as DependencyProperty using propdp snippet
  public int ItemsCount ... // Declare as DependencyProperty using propdp snippet

  protected override void OnPropertyChanged(DependencyPropertyChangedEventArgs e)
  {
    if(e.Property==ItemsContainerStyleProperty ||
       e.Property==AlternationCountProperty ||
       e.Property==ItemsCountProperty)
    {
      // Here is where we build the items for display
      DataContext =
        from index in Enumerable.Range(ItemsCount,
                                       ItemsCount + AlternationCount)
        select BuildItem( index % AlternationCount);
    }
  }
  ListViewItem BuildItem(int alternationIndex)
  {
    var item = new ListViewItem { Style = ItemsContainerStyle };
    ItemsControl.SetAlternationIndex(item, alternationIndex);
    return item;
  }

  protected override Size MeasureOverride(Size desiredSize)
  {
    var ic = (ItemsControl)GetTemplateChild(""PART_ItemsControl"");
    ic.Width = desiredSize.Width;
    Size result = base.MeasureOverride(desiredSize);
    ViewportSize = new Size(ic.DesiredSize);
    return result;
  }
  public Size ViewportSize ... // Declare as DependencyProperty using propdp snippet
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this same code could be written with <code>PropertyChangedCallback</code> instead of <code>OnPropertyChanged</code>.</p>

<p>You also need to do something to make sure the blank rows are the desired height.  The easiest way to do this is to set either <code>MinHeight</code> or <code>Content</code> in your <code>ItemsContainerStyle</code>.  Alternatively <code>ContinueAlternation</code> could set the height when it constructs each <code>ListViewItem</code>.</p>

<p>I typed all this code off the top of my head, but it is similar to code I've written and used before so it ought to work basically as-is.</p>

<pre>
Interrupt    Handler
   0         divide_by_zero_handler
   1         debug_handler

   14        page_fault_handler
   ..           ...
   18        machine_check_handler
</pre>

<p>In this context, the handlers are part of a toy kernel, and each of the handlers are set up at boot time, prior to user-land code being loaded. (BIOS is 16 bit code aka real mode code), kernel sets up the handlers, switches to 32bit protected mode, when any of the interrupts are issued, the appropriate handler is executed depending on the Interrupt number. For example, if interrupt 14 was generated, the kernel will execute a <code>page_fault_handler</code>, check if the page is dirty and reside on disk, then load that page into memory, fix up the addresses and clear the dirty bit, executes an <code>IRET</code> Interrupt Return instruction to continue, clearing the flags....</p>

<p>That is an abstract view of how IDT works...There is more complex things going on behind the scenes...depending on the architecture and type of memory management such as paged/flat/protected/virtual mode addressing schemes...</p>

<p>Have a look here at the <a href=""http://www.intel.com/design/pentium/MANUALS/241430.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Intel</a> documentation that gives an excellent and thorough view of the Intel programming...</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
Back in the old days of DOS (which was 16bit code and not well, exactly memory protected), it was possible to re-route the interrupt handlers to your own handlers thus overlaying the original IDT, for an example of such an interrupt, Interrupt 9 which is the Keyboard Interrupt (BIOS interrupts in this context) using the <code>getvect(...)</code> and <code>setvect(...)</code> calls, you could also, handle some (not all of the processor interrupts, notably, IDT 0 for divide by zero)...although those BIOS interrupts were quite similar in appearance to the processor interrupts, they shared a common feature, both did have the table of interrupt vectors (as it was known back then). That was how TSR (Terminate Stay Resident) programs were able to keep re-entrant in DOS as a result of the BIOS interrupts re-routed to the TSR's handlers...</p>

You are trying to interpolate a function beyond the range of available data -- i.e. you are going from interpolation to extrapolation.  Splines are going to result in the overshoot that you are observing.  The solution is simply to make sure that your 1D function has values in the interval [min(r), max(r)].  Note that in the original data, max(r) is about 424, while the function you are interpolating is defined on the range [-300,299]</p>

<pre><code>% Simulated overshoot, see left figure:
x1d = [-300:299];
[x,y]=meshgrid(x1d,x1d);
r = sqrt(x.^2+y.^2);
gsn1d = exp(-x1d.^2/500);
lowpass = @(x)(x1d &gt; -x &amp; x1d &lt; x);
gsn1dcutoff = ifft(fftshift(lowpass(10).*fftshift(fft(gsn1d))));
plot(gsn1dcutoff)
OTF2d = reshape(interp1(x1d,gsn1dcutoff,r(:),'spline'),[length(x1d),length(x1d)]);

% Quick and dirty fix, see right figure:
x1dExtended = linspace(min(x1d*sqrt(2)),max(x1d*sqrt(2)),ceil(length(x1d)*sqrt(2)));
gsn1dE = exp(-x1dExtended.^2/500);
% ^^^ note that this has 600*sqrt(2) points and is defined on the diagonal of your square.   Now we can low-pass filter in the freq. domain to add ripple in space domain:

"2443527","<p>I use the TMediaPlayer component for playing music.</p>

<p>It works fine with most of my tracks. But it doesn't work with some tracks. When I want to play them, the following error message is shown:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/iGH3y.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/iGH3y.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></a>

<p>Which is German but roughly means that:</p>

<p>In the project pMusicPlayer.exe an exception of the class EMCIDeviceError occurred. Message: ""Error when starting MCI."". Process was stopped. Continue with ""Single Command/Statement"" or ""Start"".</p>

<p>The program quits directly after calling the procedure ""Play"" of TMediaPlayer.</p>

<p>This error occurred with the following file for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>file size: 7.40 MB</li>
<li>duration: 4:02 minutes</li>
<li>bitrate: 256 kBit/s</li>
</ul>

<p>I've encoded this file with a bitrate of 128 kBit/s and thus a file size of 3.70 MB: It works fine!</p>

<p>What's wrong with the first file? Windows Media Player or other programs can play it without any problems.</p>

<p>Is it possible that Delphi's TMediaPlayer cannot handle big files (e.g. > 5 MB) or files with a high bitrate (e.g. > 128 kBit/s)?</p>

<p>What can I do to solve the problem?</p>

<p><strong>Additional question:</strong>
Why can't I use try/except to prevent the message window?</p>

<p>After some tests I found out that others MP3 files play well with that tutorial application. Your MP3 worked well with Windows Media Player and other multimedia players.</p>

<p>Yes re-encoding the file solve the problem, but it's not the true problem. The problem come from the metadata of the MP3 (the ID3 tags) and not the sound encoding itself.</p>

<p>I used <a href=""http://www.mp3tag.de/en/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mp3tag</a> to <strong>only</strong> remove the tags on the file and everything played well after that, no EMCIDeviceError.</p>

<p>It seems that TMediaPlayer can crash with some format of metadata. I also saw TMediaPlayer bug reports with MP3 files that embeded JPEG cover art too during my search.</p>

<p>Most people that were answering people bugs about TMediaPlayer on forums I looked were saying that TMediaPlayer is really outdated and is generally bad (I think it haven't been updated in like 10 years). If you want strong MP3 support in your application consider using <a href=""http://www.vclcomponents.com/Delphi/Multimedia/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">another component</a>. You could also use the Windows Media Player ActiveX in your Delphi application too.</p>

<p>For your additional question about the try/except try something like:</p>

<pre><code>try
    //load &amp; play here
except
    on E:Exception do
        ShowMessage('Cannot be played! ' + E.Message);

<blockquote>
  <p>But what I do not understand is the purpose of the UserApplication and Application classes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think of Application as your website. I work for a big Health Insurance Company where we have many modules (Each module (Application) has its own website). But <strong>some Users</strong>, not all, can use each module. It explains why i define UserApplication.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>role's role in this login process</p>
</blockquote>

<p>None. It just gives an UserApplication a role. I can use the financial module, which defines the following roles: Manager, Customer and Other, where i can play the role of Manager. But i can assign you a Temporary User (startDate and endDate) as Customer to use the financial module.</p>

<pre><code>Application financialModule = new Application();

financialModule.addRole(new Role(""Manager""));
financialModule.addRole(new Role(""Customer""));
financialModule.addRole(new Role(""Other""));

User arthur = new User(new Login(""#####"", ""#####""));
arthur.setFirstName(""Arthur"");
arthur.setLastName(""Ronald"");
arthur.setEnabled(true);

UserApplication financialModuleUser = new UserApplication(new Period(new Date(), null));
financialModuleUser.setUser(arthur);
financialModuleUser.addRole(financialModule.getRoleByDescription(""Manager""));

financialModule.addUserApplication(financialModuleUser);
</code></pre>

<p>Your website looks like</p>

<pre><code>Website myWebsite = new Website();
myWebsite.addRole(new Role(""Member""));
myWebsite.addRole(new Role(""WebMaster""));
myWebsite.addRole(new Role(""Moderator""));

User you = new User(new Login(""#####"", ""#####""));
you.setFirstName(""FirstName"");
you.setLastName(""LastName"");
you.setEnabled(true);

UserApplication myWebsiteUser = new UserApplication(new Period(new Date(), null));
myWebsiteUser.setUser(you);
myWebsiteUser.addRole(myWebsite.getRoleByDescription(""WebMaster""));

myWebsite.addUserApplication(myWebsiteUser);

<p>As you can see, WebMaster, Moderator and Member <strong>are just roles</strong> defined by your website. Nothing else.</p>

<p>Essentially, you want to &quot;warp&quot; the image, right? Which means every pixel in the source image goes to a predefined point - the predefinition is a transformation matrix which tells you how to rotate, scale, translate, shear, etc. the image which is essentially taking some coordinate <code>(x,y)</code> on your image and saying that, &quot;Ok, the new position for this pixel is <code>(f(x),g(y))</code>.</p>
<p>That's essentially what &quot;warping&quot; does.</p>
<p>Now, think about scaling an image ... say, to ten times the size. So that means, the pixel at <code>(1,1)</code> becomes the pixel at <code>(10,10)</code> - and then the next pixel, <code>(1,2)</code> becomes the pixel <code>(10,20)</code> in the new image. But if you keep doing this, you will have no values for a pixel, <code>(13,13)</code> because, <code>(1.3,1.3)</code> is not defined in your original image and you will have a bunch of holes in your new image - you'll have to interpolate for that value using the four pixels around it in the new image, i.e. <code>(10,10) , (10,20), (20,10), (200,2)</code> - this is called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bilinear interpolation</a>.</p>
<p>But here's another problem, suppose your transformation wasn't simple scaling and was affine (like the sample image you've posted)- then <code>(1,1)</code> would become  something like <code>(2.34,4.21)</code> and then you'd have to round them in the output image to <code>(2,4)</code> and <strong>then</strong> you'd have to do bilinear interpolation on the new image to fill in the holes or more complicated interpolation - messy right?</p>
<p>Now, there's <strong>no way</strong> to get out of interpolation, but we can get away with doing bilinear interpolation, just <strong>once</strong>. How? Simple, <em>inverse mapping.</em></p>
<p>Instead of looking at it as the source image going to the new image, think of where the data for the new image will come from in the source image! So, <code>(1,1)</code> in the new image will come from some reverse mapping in the source image, say, <code>(3.4, 2.1)</code> and then do bilinear interpolation on the source image to figure out the corresponding value!</p>
<h2>Transformation matrix</h2>
<p>Ok, so how do you define a transformation matrix for an affine transformation? <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20211029110355/https://people.gnome.org/%7Emathieu/libart/libart-affine-transformation-matrices.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This website</a> tells you how to do it by compositing different transformation matrices for rotation, shearing, etc.</p>

<p>This is a part of my database diagram. I want to perform deletion on my database which will start from tblDomain up tp tblSubTopics.</p>

<p>Tables which will have IsDeleted Column are</p>

<p>tblDomain
tblSubject
tblTopic
tblSubTopic</p>

<p>Now I want, if a user marks one domain as deleted then all the refrence field should also get marked as deleted. i.e. </p>

<p>1 domain is related to 5 subjects, those 5 subjects are related to 25 topics, those 25 topics are related to 500 subtopics and so on. </p>

<p>Then how should i mark all these fileds as Deleted. ?</p>

<p>Check out this url: <a href=""http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/</a>. </p>

<p>As you can see when you move slider up and down it changes the background of the picker div.</p>

<p>But if you inspected this DIV with Firebug, you would see it is always using this image: <a href=""http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/images/colorpicker_overlay.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/images/colorpicker_overlay.png</a></p>

<p>..because parent div is using the actual colour:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""colorpicker_color"" style=""background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);""&gt;&lt;div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Try to replace this background value in firebug, set it to <code>green</code> for instance - you will see gradient is still there, but this time gradient is green.</p>

<p>And that's our trick. Create <strong>semi-transparent PNG image</strong> to use as a <strong>background</strong>, with the pattern you showed above. <strong>Put it on top of the solid-colour background</strong>, and when you change background colour it will look like you replaced background image.</p>

<p>So in the theoretical code:</p>

<pre><code>body { background:red; margin:0; padding:0; /* make sure overlay can stretch 100% in all directions*/ }
#background-overlay { background:url(path/to/image.png); }

&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;div id=""background-overlay""&gt;
  ..content goes here
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>downside</strong> of this approach is that IE6 doesn't support transparency for PNG files. You could either use some sort of <a href=""http://www.front-end-developer.net/css/ie6-png-transparency-fix/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">png transparency fix</a> or ignore this effect completely for IE6 users. (as we don't care about their feelings anyway, right? ;-))</p>

<p>Still in my humble opinion this is the most proper way to achieve the effect you want, knowing you would want to change background colours later.</p>

"2449459","<p>I am having an issue adding an item to my dataset in Linq to SQL. I am using the exact same method in other tables with no problem. I suspect I know the problem but cannot find an answer (I also suspect all i really need is the right search term for Google). Please keep in mind this is a learning project (Although it is in use in a business)</p>

<p>I have posted my code and datacontext below. What I am doing is:</p>

<p>Create a view model (Relevant bits are shown) and a simple wpf window that allows editing of 3 properties that are bound to the category object. Category is from the datacontext. Edit works fine but add does not. If I check GetChangeSet() just before the db.submitChanges() call there are no adds, edits or deletes.</p>

<p>I suspect an issue with the fact that a Category added without a Subcategory would be an orphan but I cannot seem to find the solution.</p>

<p>Command code to open window:</p>

<pre><code>CategoryViewModel vm = new CategoryViewModel();
AddEditCategoryWindow window = new AddEditCategoryWindow(vm);
window.ShowDialog();
</code></pre>

<p>ViewModel relevant stuff:</p>

<pre><code>public class CategoryViewModel : ViewModelBase
{
    public Category category { get; set; }

    // Constructor used to Edit a Category
    public CategoryViewModel(Int16 categoryID)
    {
        db = new OITaskManagerDataContext();
        category = QueryCategory(categoryID);
    }

    // Constructor used to Add a Category
    public CategoryViewModel()
    {
        db = new OITaskManagerDataContext();
        category = new Category();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The code for saving changes:</p>

<pre><code>// Don't close window unless all controls are validated
if (!vm.IsValid(this)) return;
var changes = vm.db.GetChangeSet(); // DEBUG
try
{
    vm.db.SubmitChanges(ConflictMode.ContinueOnConflict);
}
catch (ChangeConflictException)
{
    vm.db.ChangeConflicts.ResolveAll(RefreshMode.KeepChanges);
    vm.db.SubmitChanges();

<p><strong>Update and Answer</strong></p>

<p>JayD had the answer below with the need to add:</p>

<pre><code>db.Categories.InsertOnSubmit(category); 
</code></pre>

<p>I was curious why I needed this here, but had never needed it before, to add new items to the database. It turns out that db.SubmitChanges() only submits <em>Changes</em> to existing entities and their dependencies. The reason why this was working for me before was that in all prior cases my new entities had dependencies already persisted in the database. In this case a new Category is an orphan until a Subcategory is added later.</p>

<p>I have put these classes in a class library called DomainModel and I want to reference that DomainModel from an ASP.NET MVC 2 application. From what I have read, I should also add repositories and maybe even a service layer to my DomainModel. This is what is confusing me.</p>

<p>I have read that you shouldn't create a repository for each class/table, but that you should create a repository for aggregates (groups of classes). If an entity can't exist out of the context of another entity, it shouldn't have its own repository. In my example, a Bug is always linked to a Project. Does that mean I should create a repository for the aggregate Project-Bug? What if I want to render a list of all bugs, no matter in what project they are. Should I add a method GetAllBugs() to my IProjectsRepository? Or should I create a separate IBugsRepository for that usage?</p>

<p>I think creating separate repositories could have its advantages here. From what I've read about Linq to SQL, you can set a property on the DataContext to specify how to handle lazy and eager loading. Now, when I get a list of Projects or a single Project, I want to eagerly load the list of Bugs. But I don't want to eagerly load the Project of each Bug in that list. But, if I want to load a list of all Bugs (no matter the project) or a single Bug, I <strong><em>do</em></strong> want to eagerly load the Project, but in this case I <strong><em>don't</em></strong> want to eagerly load the list of Bugs in that Project. My Linq to SQL knowlegde is very limited, but isn't this something that can only be achieved by setting the DataContext properties? Wouldn't that require me to have a DataContext for Projects and a DataContext for Bugs and thus two repositories? Unless it somehow possible to tell the DataContext to eagerly load up to 2 levels and do lazy loading for anything that's deeper? Or is all of this irrelevant because of deferred execution?</p>

<p>Please excuse me for my long, long question (that maybe isn't even that clear) but all this new information is really confusing me.</p>

<p>(I case you like to comment on my database diagram / class structure, please don't spare me :-))</p>
","Confused about Linq to SQL and repositories","<linq-to-sql><repository-pattern>","2010-03-16 09:29:36","586","2453274","1","<p>I personally only use repository patterns with L2S if I will have alternative methods of obtaining the data stored within the database - which typically means that I also have a set of interfaces for Project, Bug etc.</p>

<p>The repository pattern is a ball-ache with L2S because it complicates Updates - you pass out an object from the repository (which opened and closed a DataContext to get it - they should be short-lived you see), you modify it's properties and send it back in for an update - but you can't, because you need the original DataContext.  You need to go an get the object again from a new data context, copy the modified values, and update the second one.</p>

<p>To avoid this, you have to start passing in the data context into your repository for most operations (letting the caller determine the lifetime of the data context); which bloats all your method signatures and makes for an all-round pain in the a*s.</p>

<p>The beauty of L2S, for me, is it's speed - so I shudder when I see people needlessly wrapping the DC for the sake of it.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong - I have a system I'm writing at the moment where every object and 'data service' is abstracted away behind interfaces; and some of those data services are implemented using Linq To Sql; but that's because the whole system is intended to be a hot-swappable back-end for a whole platform.  Using L2S has been tricky, but it was still doable.</p>

<p>Secondly - in terms of your concerns about eager and lazy loading - you will typically control this with the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.linq.dataloadoptions.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DataLoadOptions class</a> and the 'LoadOptions' member of the DC instance.</p>

<p>If you find that you need fine-grained control over which stuff to lazy and eager load, then you don't need separate DCs - you just offload the creation of the datacontext to different methods tailored for the different needs:</p>

<pre><code>public MyDataContext GetDCForProjects()
{
  var DC = new MyDataContext();
  DataLoadOptions dlo = new DataLoadOptions();
  dlo.LoadWith&lt;Project&gt;(p =&gt; p.Bugs);
  DC.LoadOptions = dlo;
  return DC;
}

//add more methods for the different needs

<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2049196/generating-triangular-hexagonal-coordinates-xyz"">This question</a> talks about generating the coordinates themselves, and is quite useful. My issue now is in converting these coordinates to and from actual pixel coordinates. I am looking for a simple way to find the center of a hexagon with coordinates x,y,z. Assume (0,0) in pixel coordinates is at (0,0,0) in hex coords, and that each hexagon has an edge of length s. It seems to me like x,y, and z should each move my coordinate a certain distance along an axis, but they are interrelated in an odd way I can't quite wrap my head around it. </p>

<p>Bonus points if you can go the other direction and convert any (x,y) point in pixel coordinates to the hex that point belongs in.</p>
","Hexagonal Grid Coordinates To Pixel Coordinates","<math><coordinate-systems><hexagonal-tiles>","2010-03-17 01:43:38","32230","2459541","1","<p>For clarity, let the ""hexagonal"" coordinates be <code>(r,g,b)</code> where <code>r</code>, <code>g</code>, and <code>b</code> are the <strong>red</strong>, <strong>green</strong>, and <strong>blue</strong> coordinates, respectively.  The coordinates <code>(r,g,b)</code> and <code>(x,y)</code> are related by the following:</p>

<pre><code>y = 3/2 * s * b
b = 2/3 * y / s
x = sqrt(3) * s * ( b/2 + r)
x = - sqrt(3) * s * ( b/2 + g )
r = (sqrt(3)/3 * x - y/3 ) / s
g = -(sqrt(3)/3 * x + y/3 ) / s

r + b + g = 0
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Derivation:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>I first noticed that any horizontal row of hexagons (which should have a constant <code>y</code>-coordinate) had a constant <code>b</code> coordinate, so <code>y</code> depended only on <code>b</code>.  Each hexagon can be broken into six equilateral triangles with sides of length <code>s</code>; the centers of the hexagons in one row are one and a half side-lengths above/below the centers in the next row (or, perhaps easier to see, the centers in one row are 3 side lengths above/below the centers two rows away), so for each change of <code>1</code> in <code>b</code>, <code>y</code> changes <code>3/2 * s</code>, giving the first formula.  Solving for <code>b</code> in terms of <code>y</code> gives the second formula.</p></li>
<li><p>The hexagons with a given <code>r</code> coordinate all have centers on a line perpendicular to the r axis at the point on the <code>r</code> axis that is <code>3/2 * s</code> from the origin (similar to the above derivation of <code>y</code> in terms of <code>b</code>).  The <code>r</code> axis has slope <code>-sqrt(3)/3</code>, so a line perpendicular to it has slope <code>sqrt(3)</code>; the point on the <code>r</code> axis and on the line has coordinates <code>(3sqrt(3)/4 * s * r, -3/4 * s * r)</code>; so an equation in <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> for the line containing the centers of the hexagons with <code>r</code>-coordinate <code>r</code> is <code>y + 3/4 * s * r = sqrt(3) * (x - 3sqrt(3)/4 * s * r)</code>.  Substituting for <code>y</code> using the first formula and solving for <code>x</code> gives the second formula. (This is not how I actually derived this one, but my derivation was graphical with lots of trial and error and this algebraic method is more concise.)</p></li>
<li><p>The set of hexagons with a given <code>r</code> coordinate is the horizontal reflection of the set of hexagons with that g coordinate, so whatever the formula is for the <code>x</code> coordinate in terms of <code>r</code> and <code>b</code>, the <code>x</code> coordinate for that formula with <code>g</code> in place of <code>r</code> will be the opposite. This gives the third formula.</p></li>
<li><p>The fourth and fifth formulas come from substituting the second formula for <code>b</code> and solving for <code>r</code> or <code>g</code> in terms of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.</p></li>

"2461801","<p>I am re-writing the SQL which lets a user search for any other user on our site and also shows their roles.</p>

<p>An an example, roles can be ""Writer"", ""Editor"", ""Publisher"".</p>

<p>Each role links a User to a Publication.</p>

<p>Users can take multiple roles within multiple publications.</p>

<p>Example table setup:</p>

<pre><code>""users"" : user_id, firstname, lastname
""publications"" : publication_id, name  
""link_writers"" : user_id, publication_id  
""link_editors"" : user_id, publication_id  
</code></pre>

<p>Current psuedo SQL:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM (
  (SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE firstname LIKE '%Jenkz%') 
  UNION 
  (SELECT user_id FROM users WHERE lastname LIKE '%Jenkz%')
) AS dt
JOIN (ROLES STATEMENT) AS roles ON roles.user_id = dt.user_id
</code></pre>

<p>At the moment my roles statement is:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  dt2.user_id, dt2.publication_id, dt.role FROM (
  (SELECT 'writer' AS role, link_writers.user_id, link_writers.publication_id
  FROM link_writers)
  UNION
  (SELECT 'editor' AS role, link_editors.user_id, link_editors.publication_id
  FROM link_editors)
) AS dt2
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for wrapping the roles statement in UNION clauses is that some roles are more complex and require a table join to find the publication_id and user_id.</p>

<p>As an example ""publishers"" might be linked accross two tables</p>

<pre><code>""link_publishers"": user_id, publisher_group_id
""link_publisher_groups"": publisher_group_id, publication_id
</code></pre>

<p>So in that instance, the query forming part of my UNION would be:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 'publisher' AS role, link_publishers.user_id, link_publisher_groups.publication_id
FROM link_publishers
JOIN link_publisher_groups ON lpg.group_id = lp.group_id
</code></pre>

<p>I'm pretty confident that my table setup is good (I was warned off the one-table-for-all system when researching the layout). My problem is that there are now 100,000 rows in the users table and upto 70,000 rows in each of the link tables.</p>

<p>Initial lookup in the users table is fast, but the joining really slows things down.</p>

<p>How can I only join on the relevant roles?</p>

<p>-------------------------- EDIT ----------------------------------
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/ODhY0.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ODhY0.gif"" alt=""explain""></a>
</p>

<p>Explain above (open in a new window to see full resolution).</p>

<p>The bottom bit in red, is the ""WHERE firstname LIKE '%Jenkz%'"" the third row searches WHERE CONCAT(firstname, ' ', lastname) LIKE '%Jenkz%'. Hence the large row count, but I think this is unavoidable, unless there is a way to put an index accross concatenated fields?</p>

<p>The green bit at the top just shows the total rows scanned from the ROLES STATEMENT.</p>

<p>You can then see each individual UNION clause (#6 - #12) which all show a large number of rows. Some of the indexes are normal, some are unique.</p>

<p>It seems that MySQL isn't optimizing to use the dt.user_id as a comparison for the internal of the UNION statements. Is there any way to force this behaviour?</p>

<p>Please note that my real setup is not publications and writers but ""webmasters"", ""players"", ""teams"" etc.</p>

"2464094","<p>With the following entity relationship structure I'm struggling to figure out if the relationship between the LOAN and ITEM entities is valid?</p>

<p>The weak entity of LOAN uses a partial key of 'loan_dateLeant' and the primary keys from CUSTOMER and ITEM to form LOANs primary key.
However LOAN has a 'one to many' relationship with ITEM as a loan can consist of more than one item.
But surely this means that if more than one item is loaned, then the loan record will have two item_id values for part of its primary key?</p>

What you might consider doing instead is adding a unique <code>loan_id</code> that you make part of your primary key, instead of the items the loan contains; then a single loan is defined by its customer and loan ID (or customer, date, and loan ID).</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, make <code>date_leant</code> a datetime field, and increase the precision on it until you can't possibly (within the constraints of your system) have two loans occur at the same time - how likely is it that a single customer transacts two separate loans within milliseconds of each other?</p>

<p>Note this doesn't prevent the LOAN entity from taking part in the relationship as the ""one""; it just means that you can't define the weak entity using the ""many"".</p>

"2465645","<p>We've had <em>Reiner Knizia's Money</em> out for a couple of months now. It's
done pretty well, and so we've been updating it as time allows.
However, one thing continues to bug me. I've never been able to get my
layered cards to anti-alias correctly.</p>

<p>Here's a sample:</p>

<p><img src=""https://www.rpg.net/pictures/show-pic.phtml?picid=17352"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Cards that are laid straight are very clean, but whenever they're
angled the black lines around the cards get jagged. I've tried this
depending on both lines implicit to the artwork and lines drawn
through drawRect:, and they both do the same thing. I've tried the
edgeAntiAliasingMask and it doesn't do a thing as far as I can tell.
I've tried masksToBounds for the sublayers set to NO and YES.</p>

<p>Right now my card is set up as a CALayer that has sub-CALayers for the
front and the back, plus for a few other things like a lightening mask
and a darkening mask. Here's some snippets of the code:</p>

<pre><code>   CArdLayer *theCardLayer = [CArdLayer layer];
   theCardLayer.edgeAntialiasingMask = kCALayerLeftEdge | kCALayerRightEdge | kCALayerBottomEdge | kCALayerTopEdge;

   theCardLayer.front = [CALayer layer];
   theCardLayer.front.edgeAntialiasingMask = kCALayerLeftEdge | kCALayerRightEdge | kCALayerBottomEdge | kCALayerTopEdge;
   theCardLayer.front.bounds = theCardLayer.bounds;
   theCardLayer.front.masksToBounds = YES;
   theCardLayer.front.contents = (id)[cardDrawing CGImage];

   [theCardLayer addSublayer:theCardLayer.front];
</code></pre>

<p>Etc ...</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to make the cards actually anti-alias?</p>

With that little bit of margin, the cards composited much better with the background.</p>

<p>So, not exactly an iPhone code answer, but one that nonetheless works on the iPhone.</p>

<p>Here's an ""after"" shot that you can compare to the ""before"", above:
<img src=""https://www.rpg.net/pictures/show-pic.phtml?picid=17363"" alt=""alt text""></p>
"
"2466342","<p>I am working on a project that requires some image processing. The front end of the program is C# (cause the guys thought it is a lot simpler to make the UI in it). However, as the image processing part needs a lot of CPU juice I am making this part in C++. </p>

<p>The idea is to link it to the C# project and just call a function from a DLL to make the image processing part and allow to the C# environment to process the data afterwards. Now the only problem is that it seems I am not able to make the DLL. Simply put the compiler refuses to put any function into the DLL that I compile. </p>

<p>Because the project requires some development time testing I have created two projects into a C++ solution. One is for the Dll and another console application. The console project holds all the files and I just include the corresponding header into my DLL project file. I thought the compiler should take out the functions that I marked as to be exported and make the DLL from them. Nevertheless this does not happens. </p>

<p>Here it is how I defined the function in the header: </p>

<pre><code>extern ""C"" __declspec(dllexport)  void _stdcall RobotData(BYTE* buf, int** pToNewBackgroundImage, int* pToBackgroundImage,  bool InitFlag, ObjectInformation* robot1, ObjectInformation* robot2,   ObjectInformation* robot3, ObjectInformation* robot4,  ObjectInformation* puck);

extern ""C"" __declspec(dllexport)  CvPoint _stdcall RefPointFinder(IplImage* imgInput, CvRect &amp;imgROI, 
                         CvScalar &amp;refHSVColorLow, CvScalar &amp;refHSVColorHi );
</code></pre>

<p>Followed by the implementation in the cpp file: </p>

<pre><code>extern ""C"" __declspec(dllexport)  CvPoint _stdcall RefPointFinder(IplImage* imgInput, CvRect  &amp;imgROI,&amp;refHSVColorLow, CvScalar &amp;refHSVColorHi ) { \\...
                  return cvPoint((int)( M10/M00) +  imgROI.x, (int)( M01/M00 ) +  imgROI.y) ;}

extern ""C"" __declspec(dllexport)  void _stdcall RobotData(BYTE* buf, int** pToNewBackgroundImage, int* pToBackgroundImage,  bool InitFlag, ObjectInformation* robot1, ObjectInformation* robot2,   ObjectInformation* robot3, ObjectInformation* robot4,  ObjectInformation* puck) { \\ ...};
</code></pre>

<p>And my main file for the DLL project looks like: </p>

<pre><code>#ifdef _MANAGED
#pragma managed(push, off)
#endif

/// &lt;summary&gt; Include files.  &lt;/summary&gt;
#include ""..\ImageProcessingDebug\ImageProcessingTest.h""
#include ""..\ImageProcessingDebug\ImageProcessing.h""


BOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HMODULE hModule, DWORD  ul_reason_for_call, LPVOID lpReserved)
{
 return TRUE;
}

#ifdef _MANAGED
#pragma managed(pop)
#endif
</code></pre>

<p>Needless to say it does not work. A quick look with DLL export viewer 1.36 reveals that no function is inside the library. I don't get it. What I am doing wrong ? 
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/V1PXz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/V1PXz.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></a>

As side not I am using the C++ objects (and here it is the C++ DLL part)  such as the vector. However, only for internal usage. These will not appear in the headers of either function as you can observe from the previous code snippets. </p>

<p>Any ideas? Thx,</p>

If it is true that ""The console project holds all the files"" then this is your problem.</p>

<p>Your DLL project needs to include the cpp file which has the __declspec(dllexport)s. As you describe it, you have included your RefPointFinder() &amp; RobotData() functions in the console project. In other words your DLL has no functions in it whatsoever, regardless of whether anything is exported.</p>

<p>Just including the .h files in the DLL main file does nothing by itself. It doesn't include these functions in the DLL.</p>

"2471498","<p>In Vista and later, if an app becomes unresponsive, the Desktop Window Manager is able to handle redrawing it when necessary (move a window over it, drag it around, etc.) because it has kept a pixel buffer for it.  Windows also tries to detect when an app has become unresponsive after some timeout, and tries to make the best of the situation -- I believe it dims out the window, adds ""Not Responding"" to its title bar, and perhaps some other effects.</p>

<p>Now, we have a skinned app that uses window regions and layered windows, and it doesn't play well with these effects.  We've been developing on XP, but have noticed a strange effect when testing on Vista.  At some points the app may spend a few moments on some calculation or callback, and ""if a message has not been retrieved within 5 seconds, the DWM declares the window to be hung"" (<a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/Win7AppQual/preventing-hangs-in-windows-applications"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSDN - Preventing Hangs in Windows Applications</a>). It seems that when this kicks in, a strange graphical problem occurs: any pixels that would be 100% transparent due to the window regions turn black, which effectively makes the window rectangular again, with a black background.  There seem to be other anomalies, with the original window's pixels being shifted a bit in some child dialogs.</p>

<p>I am working on reducing such delays (ideally Windows will never need to step in like this), and trying to maintain responsiveness while it's busy, but I'd still like to figure out what is causing it to render like that, as I can't guarantee I can eliminate all delays.</p>

<p>Basically, I just would like to know what Windows is doing when this happens, and how I can make my app behave properly with it.  Skinned apps have to still work on Vista and later, so I need to figure out what I'm doing that's non-standard.  I don't even know exactly how to look for information into how Windows now handles unresponsive apps, as my searches only return people having issues with apps that are unresponsive, or very rudimentary explanations of what the DWM does with such apps.  Heck I'm not even 100% sure it's the DWM responsible, but it seems likely.  Any potential leads?</p>

<p>Photo of problem; screen shots won't capture the effect (note that the white dialog's buffer is shifted -- it is shifted exactly by the distance it has been offset from the main (blue) window):</p>

","DWM and painting unresponsive apps","<windows-vista><dwm>","2010-03-18 16:19:49","651","2725298","3","<p>I have found that it is called 'ghosting' when it does this, and it was introduced in XP (though it seems DWM takes it a step further since it keeps track of every app's pixels).  It is possible to disable it for the duration of your app's life with <code>DisableProcessWindowsGhosting()</code>.  Some folks say that it is not recommended, but considering how badly it plays with layered windows, the downsides of turning it off are negligible.  I've tested it and it does precisely what it claims; now if the server takes a little longer than expected to return, it won't mangle the entire interface.</p>

<p>If there is a better way to get my layered windows to work with Vista/7's handling of ghosting without disabling it outright, I'd certainly still be interested, but I'll probably just accept this as the answer otherwise.</p>

"2471802","<p>I need help to align CSS buttons. I tried many different variations and I just cannot center my button the way I want.</p>

<p>Firstly, have a look at this url: <a href=""http://www.front-end-developer.net/cssbuttons/example.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.front-end-developer.net/cssbuttons/example.htm</a></p>

<p>I'm using 2 images to form a button (this could be done on 1 image, but in this case we've got two). Everything works as expected as long as we apply <code>float:left</code> or <code>float:right</code> to the parent div element, to 'limit' width of the div and close it as soon as the content of the div ends. You can remove float:left from the button to see what I mean.</p>

<p>But what about center positioned buttons? I cannot add float:left/right because I want align it in the middle.</p>

<p>In theory, I could set</p>

<pre><code>{
    width:XXpx;
    margin:0 auto;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I also tried to use <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, but unfortunately nested inline elements don't respect their padding correctly...</p>

<p>And yes, I must use <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> inside, so buttons can be accessed by web crawlers.</p>

If, however, you use Emacs &amp; SLIME (the development environment of choice of a great part of the Clojure community!), then you can have the SLIME REPL highlight syntax like <code>clojure-mode</code> does.</p>

<p>First, you'll have to lift some code from the <code>clojure-mode</code> function (defined towards the top of <code>clojure-mode.el</code>):</p>

<pre><code>;;; all code in this function lifted from the clojure-mode function
;;; from clojure-mode.el

    (add-to-list 'clojure-font-lock-keywords
                 'clojure-font-lock-mark-comment t)
    (set (make-local-variable 'open-paren-in-column-0-is-defun-start) nil))

  (setq font-lock-defaults
        '(clojure-font-lock-keywords    ; keywords

          ((""+-*/.&lt;&gt;=!?$%_&amp;~^:@"" . ""w"")) ; syntax alist
          nil
          (font-lock-mark-block-function . mark-defun)
          (font-lock-syntactic-face-function
           . lisp-font-lock-syntactic-face-function))))
</code></pre>

<p>Then add it to the <code>slime-repl-mode-hook</code>:</p>

<pre><code>(add-hook 'slime-repl-mode-hook

            (font-lock-mode t)))
</code></pre>

<p>Et voilà, next time you connect to the SLIME REPL you'll have <code>clojure-mode</code> syntax highlighting available. If you use SLIME for Common Lisp too, you'll want to tweak this so it doesn't try to do Clojure highlighting with CL. Also, this is just a first approximation; one thing it sort of breaks is prompt highlighting (the <code>namespace&gt;</code> thing will not be highlighted anymore). I'm not a proficient <code>font-lock</code> hacker by any stretch of the imagination, though, so I'll leave it at that. :-)</p>

<li><p>Running the app from VS 2008 an <strong>""Unable to start debugging on the web server...""</strong> dialog is displayed.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Infrastructure</h2>

<ul>
<li>Web server: IIS 7 running on Windows 7 x64</li>
<li>ASP.Net MVC2</li>
<li>Application pool: Dot Net 2.0 integrated</li>
<li>VS 2008</li>
</ul>

<h2>Things Tried</h2>

<ul>
<li>Checked to see if the problem was occurring in other IIS app directories on the same machine.</li>
<li>Removed and re-added the application in IIS.</li>
<li>Reverted to prior versions of the web.config file.</li>
<li>Checked out a last working version of the source code.  Rebuilt the app, added a new app directory for it and tried to view web.config contents from IIS.</li>
<li>Looked for web.config files that might have duplicate sections in:

<ul>
<li>Inetpub root.</li>
<li>""C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\CONFIG\machine.config""</li>
<li>The ""Views"" subfolder of the ASP.Net MVC app.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Checked out source code to another dev machine.  Setup IIS 7 app folder.  No problem with Web.config.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Question</h2>

<ul>
<li>If the reason for this error is another web.config file where else should I look?</li>
<li>Are there other reasons for these symptoms?</li>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that the machine.config you check is from the same Dot Net framework as the application pool your application is running under.</li>
</ul>

<p>In my case the default application pools was changed from Dot Net 2.0 to Dot Net 4.0.  This changed the root machine.config to the 4.0 version.  This version contains the ""scriptResourceHandler"" section as well as others.  Thus the duplicate section warning.</p>

It doesn't really make sense, because in order to do that you'd need to know what the final graph will look like, yet placing one node manually would then change how the rest of the graph is rendered.</p>

<p>I solved this problem by changing the order in which my nodes are defined in the <code>.dot</code> file, and tweaking the <code>nodesep</code> and <code>ranksep</code> attributes at the graph level. It's a process of refinement - tweaking a few things at a time until it looks right.</p>

<p>You might also render the graph as <code>SVG</code>, then import it into Visio (or another editor) and manually rearrange the nodes you're not happy with.</p>

<p>You <em>may</em> find this solution is faster than using an additional library as your hand-built code will be tailored directly to the problem in hand. Not having used FileHelpers I don't know of its speed overhead.</p>

"2479342","<p>I'm trying to get a layout to look like this :

<p>I've had all sorts of fun trying to get this working. I finally got something that almost works, but only because I dropped in the 3.2 beta of Ext JS.</p>

<p>I'm left with one final problem. The code below will display the panels almost correctly, however, the right hand panel doesn't stretch to fill the right hand half of the container.</p>

<p>If I add a layout config (shown in the code commented out) and remove the layout attribute, then I end up with all three panels arranged vertically, rather than the two hbox panels being stretched to fill the space and the vbox panels being above one another.</p>

<p>I'd really appreciate someone passing an eye over the code below and pointing out what I'm missing or if I've encountered a bug in ExtJS 3.2b.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

","Problem with ExtJS vbox layout nested in a hbox layout","<javascript><layout><extjs>","2010-03-19 17:32:07","14510","2479456","2","<p>So, after a lead from Jay Garcia I've fixed this in moments.</p>

<p>I needed to set my viewport to be of layout type  ""fit""</p>

<pre><code>vp = new Ext.Viewport({
    layout : 'fit',
    items : [overviewPanel] ,
    renderTo : Ext.getBody()
});
</code></pre>

<p>then I needed to add the layout attribute into the vbox and the hbox (previously I found that the layout attribute with the layoutConfig type attribute screwed things up, so removed them)</p>

<pre><code>            var extraPanel = {
                title : 'extra panel',
                layout : 'vbox',
                layoutConfig : {
                    type : 'vbox',
                    align : 'stretch',
                    pack : 'start'
                },
                defaults : {
                    flex : 1,

                },
                items : [workflowPanel,accessPanel]
            };

            var overviewPanel = {
                layout : 'hbox',
                layoutConfig : {
                    type :'hbox',
                    align : 'stretch',
                    pack : 'start'
                },
                defaults :{
                    frame : true,

                },
                items : [detailPanel,extraPanel]
            };

<p>Those 2 changes gave me a beautiful layout, exactly the way I wanted it to display. </p>
