"3265986","<p>This problem actually deals with roll-overs, I'll just generalized below as such:</p>

<p>I have a 2D view, and I have a number of rectangles within an area on the screen. How do I spread out those boxes such that they don't overlap each other, but only adjust them with minimal moving? </p>

<p>The rectangles' positions are dynamic and dependent on user's input, so their positions could be anywhere. </p>

<p>Attached<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/3LVLK.jpg"" alt=""alt text""> images show the problem and desired solution</p>

<p>The real life problem deals with rollovers, actually.</p>

<p>Answers to the questions in the comments</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Size of rectangles is not fixed, and is dependent on the length of the text in the rollover</p></li>
<li><p>About screen size, right now I think it's better to assume that the size of the screen is enough for the rectangles. If there is too many rectangles and the algo produces no solution, then I just have to tweak the content.</p></li>
<li><p>The requirement to 'move minimally' is more for asethetics than an absolute engineering requirement. One could space out two rectangles by adding a vast distance between them, but it won't look good as part of the GUI. The idea is to get the rollover/rectangle as close as to its source (which I will then connect to the source with a black line). So either 'moving just one for x' or 'moving both for half x' is fine.</p></li>

You helped me to get some impulse :D  </p>

<p>I also needed the source code, so here it is.  I worked it out in Mathematica, but as I haven't used heavily the functional features, I guess it'll be easy to translate to any procedural language.</p>

<h2>A historic perspective</h2>

<p>  
First I decided to develop the algorithm for circles, because the intersection is easier to calculate. It just depends on the centers and radii.  
</p>

<p>I was able to use the Mathematica equation solver, and it performed nicely.  </p>

<p>Just look:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/SiElU.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/SiElU.png"" alt=""alt text""></a></p>

<p>It was easy. I just loaded the solver with the following problem:</p>

<pre><code>For each circle
 Solve[
  Find new co√∂rdinates for the circle
  Minimizing the distance to the geometric center of the image
  Taking in account that
      Distance between centers &gt; R1+R2 *for all other circles
      Move the circle in a line between its center and the 
                                         geometric center of the drawing
   ]
</code></pre>

<p>As straightforward as that, and Mathematica did all the work.  </p>

<p>I said ""Ha! it's easy, now let's go for the rectangles!"". But I was wrong ...</p>

<h2>Rectangular Blues</h2>

<p>The main problem with the rectangles is that querying the intersection is a nasty function. Something like:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/g8R2k.png"" width=""420"" height=""60""></p>

<p>
So, when I tried to feed up Mathematica with a lot of these conditions for the equation, it performed so badly that I decided to do something procedural.
</p>

<p>
My algorithm ended up as follows:  
</p>

<pre><code>Expand each rectangle size by a few points to get gaps in final configuration
While There are intersections
    sort list of rectangles by number of intersections
    push most intersected rectangle on stack, and remove it from list
// Now all remaining rectangles doesn't intersect each other
While stack not empty
    pop  rectangle from stack and re-insert it into list
    find the geometric center G of the chart (each time!)
    find the movement vector M (from G to rectangle center)
    move the rectangle incrementally in the direction of M (both sides) 
                                                 until no intersections  
Shrink the rectangles to its original size
</code></pre>

<p>You may note that the ""smallest movement"" condition is not completely satisfied (only in one direction). But I found that moving the rectangles in any direction to satisfy it, sometimes ends up with a confusing map changing for the user.  </p>

<p>As I am designing a user interface, I choose to move the rectangle a little further, but in a more predictable way. You can change the algorithm to inspect all angles and all radii surrounding its current position until an empty place is found, although it'll be much more demanding.  </p>

<p>Anyway, these are examples of the results (before/ after):  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/tFpAc.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/tFpAc.png"" alt=""alt text""></a></p>

<p>Edit> More examples <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Lz5F4.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a></p>

<p>As you may see, the ""minimum movement"" is not satisfied, but the results are good enough.   </p>

<p>I'll post the code here because I'm having some trouble with my SVN repository. I'll remove it when the problems are solved.  </p>

<h2>Edit: </h2>

<p>You may also use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-tree"" rel=""noreferrer"">R-Trees</a> for finding rectangle intersections, but it seems an overkill for dealing with a small number of rectangles. And I haven't the algorithms already implemented. Perhaps someone else can point you to an existing implementation on your platform of choice. </p>

<h2>Edit: Multi-angle searching</h2>

<p><p>
I implemented a change in the algorithm allowing to search in all directions, but giving preference to the axis imposed by the geometric symmetry.<br>
At the expense of more cycles, this resulted in more compact final configurations, as you can see here below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/r3vpU.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/r3vpU.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>More samples <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/8gY7c.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>The pseudocode for the main loop changed to:</p>

<pre><code>Expand each rectangle size by a few points to get gaps in final configuration
While There are intersections
    sort list of rectangles by number of intersections
    push most intersected rectangle on stack, and remove it from list
// Now all remaining rectangles doesn't intersect each other
While stack not empty
    find the geometric center G of the chart (each time!)
    find the PREFERRED movement vector M (from G to rectangle center)
    pop  rectangle from stack 
    With the rectangle
         While there are intersections (list+rectangle)
              For increasing movement modulus
                 For increasing angle (0, Pi/4)
                    rotate vector M expanding the angle alongside M
                    (* angle, -angle, Pi + angle, Pi-angle*)
                    re-position the rectangle accorging to M
    Re-insert modified vector into list
Shrink the rectangles to its original size

</code></pre>

<p>All I do is get the current object, access the first face, get the normal, get the vertices, calculate the rotation matrix, invert it, then multiply it by each vertex.
Finally I write a simple output.</p>

<p>Here's the output for a default plane for which I rotated all the vertices manually by 30 degrees:</p>

<pre><code>Plane.008

original vertex2: [-1.000000, -0.866025, -0.500000](vector)
original vertex3: [1.000000, -0.866025, -0.500000](vector)

rotated vertex0: [1.000000, 0.866025, 1.000011](vector)

rotated vertex3: [1.000000, -0.866025, -1.000012](vector)
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the first face of the famous Suzanne mesh:</p>

<pre><code>Suzanne.001
face: [MFace (46 0 2 44) 0]

original vertex2: [0.500000, 0.093750, 0.687500](vector)
original vertex3: [0.562500, 0.242188, 0.671875](vector)

rotated vertex0: [0.468750, 0.242188, -0.795592](vector)
rotated vertex1: [0.437500, 0.164063, -0.803794](vector)

rotated vertex3: [0.562500, 0.242188, -0.705370](vector)
</code></pre>

<p>The vertices from the Plane.008 mesh are altered, the ones from Suzanne.001's mesh
aren't. Shouldn't they ? Should I expect to get zeroes on one axis ?
Once I got the rotation matrix from the normal vector, what is the rotation on x,y,z ?</p>

<p><em>Note:</em> 1. Blender's Matrix supports the * operator 2.In Blender's coordinate system Z point's up. It looks like a right handed system, rotated 90 degrees on X.</p>

The normal is the vector.  The angle is 0.  You probably want the inverse rotation.</p>

<p>Is your mesh triangulated?  I'm assuming it is.  If so, you can do this, without rotation matrices.  Let the points of the face be <code>A,B,C</code>.  Take any two vertices of the face, say <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>.  Define the x axis along vector <code>AB</code>. <code>A</code> is at <code>0,0</code>.  <code>B</code> is at <code>0,|AB|</code>.  <code>C</code> can be determined from trigonometry using the angle between <code>AC</code> and <code>AB</code> (which you get by using the dot product) and the length <code>|AC|</code>.</p>

<p>Experience shows that when you combine several OCR technologies, the best decision rule is to rely on results of most accurate one and just ingore others. From my experience (I work for ABBYY), ABBYY OCR is definetely the most accurate from ones you mentioned.</p>

<p>As far as I know, the only reason to use voting is when you want cross-check ""suspicious"" characters and send them to manual verification if 100% accuracy is a requirement. Using this approach you increase number of characters to verify, but reduce possibility to miss wrong character.</p>

<p>You have to choose an appropriate dimension based on other aspects of your layout, so it won't be automatic.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to define a size for the actual tabbed pan.</p>

<p>The size of the <code>JTabbedPane</code> is a function of the dimensions and <code>LayoutManager</code> of the <code>Container</code> to which it has been added. In the <a href=""http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/E17409_01/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/tabbedpane.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">example cited</a>, the default layout of the frame's content pane is <code>BorderLayout</code>, and <code>add(pane)</code> adds it to the center by default.</p>

<p>To accomplish your goal, I see two approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Divide the current width of the enclosing <code>Container</code> among the existing tabs and repaint the tabbed pane, as shown in this <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3158757"">example</a>.</p></li>

<p>As you can see, the submenu that originates from parent ""Long long long submenu item"" isn't positioned correctly. I know what I need to do, but not how to execute it.</p>

<p>First, I need to know the width of the parent menu. I then need to set the submenu's <code>left</code> attribute to that width + 5px (I used padding) + 1px (so that the parent menu and submenu are not directly connected to each other). How do I do this for all menu items?</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the width of a menu is not fixed, since Supersubs adjusts the width to the longest item.</p>

"3275250","<p>My little game project is a physics based platform jobbie created with Chipmunk (via SpaceManager) in Cocos2d. </p>

<p>I wanted something a little different to the a-typical tile mapped level design, so I'm creating levels as SVG files in Illustrator, which I then parse to create the landscape, platforms, spawn points etc etc. It's working pretty well and I feel like I can be as creative as I want with the level design this way. </p>

<p>However, this approach only creates the chipmunk bodies and shapes so far. It doesn't help me when it comes to creating graphics for things like the landscape. </p>

<p>So to illustrate what I'm talking about, a basic level would look a little something like this (scaled down)
<a href=""http://www.tomelders.com/bin/leveleg.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">alt text http://www.tomelders.com/bin/leveleg.jpg</a></p>

<p>The grey areas would represent the landscape. </p>

<p>My first thought was to trace over these levels in Photoshop, and slice them up into 512x512 pngs, which could then be laid on on top of the physics layer. But that instinctively sounds like a very inefficient way to go. </p>

<p>the guys behind Rolando have taken a super simple approach which works well for them </p>

<img src=""https://ipadapplications.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/77cb8902ed26.jpeg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Which the more I look at, thew more I'm convinced that they're using the first approach I mentioned of laying large images over the top of everything. </p>

<p>So, my question is, does anyone have any tips or insight into what sort of stuff I should be exploring or reading up on to accomplish this sort of stuff. Up to now, my only experience with creating level graphics in Cocos2d has been with TMXTileMaps. I'm still new to game development so perhaps there's some jargon and terminology to describe what I'm aiming for that I just don't know yet. </p>

<p>Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. </p>

<p>PS: I know question within questions are bad form but it makes sense here: What's the math behind memory usage? Is there a formula I can use to figure out the memory usage of my graphics up front.</p>

In Cocos2d, you can create your sprites using a texture, which you can generate by drawing into an image buffer.  That would give you the best of both worlds.  You could use the level data to draw the large 512x512 image chunks you mention with large vector shapes for the terrain areas, but then use smaller graphics to decorate them to your heart's content, either based on the data you include with your map, or procedurally.  That would allow you to create something like what MX Mayhem has without shipping lots of giant image files with your app.  (In fact, it wouldn't surprise me if this is how MX Mayhem does it.)</p>

<p>With optimizations turned on, the assembler code generated by this is actually shorter compared to the proposed code, contains no redundant code and I'm willing to bet is faster. Here are a few optimizations I noticed in the Delphi-generated code (<em>compared to the assembler code proposed by the OP</em>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Delphi reversed the loop (downto 0). This saves one ""CMP"" instruction because the compiler can simply ""DEC ESI"" and loop on the zero flag.</li>
<li>Used ""XOR EDX"" and ""DIV EBX"" for the second division, saving some tiny amount of cycles.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why is the provided assembler code failing?</h2>

<p>Here's the original assembler code, with comments. The bug's at the end of the routine, at the ""CMP"" instruction - it's comparing ESI to the length of the KEY, not to the length of the NAME. If the KEY is longer then the NAME, ""encryption"" goes on over the top of NAME, overwriting stuff (amongst the stuff that gets overwritten is the NULL terminator for the string, causing the debugger to show funny chars after the correct chars).</p>

<p>While overwriting EBX and ESI is not allowed, this is not what's causing the code to AV, probably because the surrounding Delphi code didn't use EBX or ESI (just tried this).</p>

<pre><code>asm

 XOR EAX,EAX ; Wasteful, the first instruction in Loop overwrites EAX
 XOR ESI,ESI

                                    ; but why would one do this? Isn't ESI (the index) always supposed to
                                    ; be LESS THEN nameLen? This is the first sign of trouble.
        LEA EAX,DWORD PTR DS:[name] ; EAX now holds the address of NAME.

I think I'd just pull out a unique list of ""Code"", ""Item"", ""Price"" and then use this unique list to LEFT JOIN against each one of your queries (Sales, Breakage, Return).  You can use a coalesce to default the values to 0 if they are null, and you can use a final where clause to drop-out any records that have zero for all three results (unless you want to show there was nothing done at a given price).</p>

"3279509","<p>I have created a strongly typed dataset in the VS 2005 Dataset Designer. 
There are two tables that relates to each other in a <em>one to many</em> relationship: Claim and ClaimDetail. The designer automatically creates a function GetClaimDetailRows which returns all ClaimDetailRows  for a ClaimRow. <strong>Why is this Array's length always 0?</strong>
Because ClaimDetail contains more than 40 Million rows, i did'nt fill it before i call GetClaimDetailRows but had configured it's selectcommand that it takes a parameter idData to fill only the related records.  But that seems not to work because the  ClaimDetail-Datatable is empty. </p>

<p>When debugging i see that it jumps into the else block but returns 0 rows.
Do i have to fill the Claimdetail-Datatable first(ClearBeforeFill=True) for each Claim? But then i dont need to use this function anymore.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I now fill the Datatable(ClearBeforeFill=True)before i call the Child-function and it works. But i dont understand why it could not throw an exception(optionally) when i try to acess a child-relation without having that datatable being filled(at least with 0 rows). Instead of that it returns 0 rows what can be correct or incorrect and is difficult to detect. Is this a lack of design or am i missing something? </p>

<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model"" rel=""noreferrer"">Nested sets</a>, where each node has 'left' and 'right' IDs, such that all child nodes are contained in that range.</li>
<li>Adjacency lists agumented with a root ID.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these has its own advantages and disadvantages. Adjacency lists are simple, and cheap to update, but require multiple queries to retrieve a subtree (one for each parent node). Augmented adjacency lists make it possible to retrieve an entire tree by storing the ID of the root node in every record.</p>

<p>Materialized paths are easy to implement and cheap to update, and permit querying arbitrary subtrees, but impose increasing overhead for deep trees.</p>

<p>Nested sets are tougher to implement, and require updating, on average, half the nodes each time you make an insertion. They allow you to query arbitrary subtrees, without the increasing key length issue materialized path has.</p>

<p>In your specific case, though, it seems like you don't actually need a tree structure at all: each story, branched off an original though it may be, stands alone. What I would suggest is having a 'Story' model, which contains a list of keys of its paragraphs (Eg, in Python a db.ListProperty(db.Key)). To render a story, you fetch the Story, then do a batch fetch for all the Paragraphs. To branch a story, simply duplicate the story entry - leaving the references to Paragraphs unchanged.</p>

<ul>
<li>edit - 
Dived into this a bit deeper, and the reason my posted code works as opposed to the question's is because of the ""helper:clone"" option in the draggable. When a helper is used, it applies the left/top css to the helper, not to the actual element we are dragging.</li>
</ul>

<p>The start/stop toggles in the draggable make the original element disappear, but turns it back on when its dropped - to simulate the default visual of $().draggable().</p>

<p>Also, I would be careful of the floats you have in your css - that may also give odd results.</p>

<ul>
<li>The ImageView on the right is a set icon of the full height of the row with padding around it?</li>
<li>The two TextViews take up the majority of the width. The Address textview has the possibility of the text being long so it may need to get truncated if it runs out of space, or ideally have the font size shrink?</li>
<li>The next TextView will just hold a small string of max 5 characters.</li>
<li>The last ImageView is a small arrow to imply that this list item is clickable for more infomation. It needs to be centred like shown.</li>

"3290036","<p>is there any way to apply to a table cells' both the separate and the collapsed border properties to have  collapsed but  separated? Thanks</p>

","CSS: table border separated horizontally and collapsed vertically","<html><css>","2010-07-20 12:47:53","15527","3290351","5","<p>No, the <code>border-collapse</code> does not allow for separate defining of the horizontal and vertical. You can achieve it with extra markup (which, on a table, could end up being <strong>a lot</strong> of extra markup), so <em>I don't advise it,</em> but I will give the code for it:</p>

<p>Html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;th&gt;&lt;div&gt;Header 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
     &lt;th&gt;&lt;div&gt;Header 2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;&lt;div&gt;Content 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;&lt;div&gt;Content 2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;&lt;div&gt;Content 3&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;&lt;div&gt;Content 4&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And css:</p>

<pre><code>table {border-collapse: collapse;}
th, td { border: 0; padding: 0;}
th div, td div {margin: 5px 0 0; border: 1px solid #ff0000; padding: 5px;}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you may want to use a class on the <code>div</code> or a child selector, some way of only targeting the <code>div</code> if you might have other div's in the <code>table</code> data. The <code>margin</code> controls your horizontal gap, and of course, your <code>padding</code> or <code>border</code> width can be whatever you want.</p>

<p>basically, i started off with ""decoding"" a simpler, more common, many to many bidirectional relationship. </p>

<li>$user->groups</li>

<li>1 group can have many users

<p>very straight forward. but how does this make sense in SQL? </p>

<pre><code># select groups user is in
select group_id from users_groups
where user_id = 1

#select users of group
select user_id from users_groups
where group_id = 1

<p>now to the actual model ... in SQL</p>

<p><img src=""https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4121/4814728024_6a86f67930.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

# select users that are friends of given user
# $user-&gt;friendsWithMe
select user_id from friends
where friend_id = 1;
</code></pre>

<p>ah ha! <strong>select users that are friends of given user</strong>. so this is how i get <code>$friendsWithMe</code>. then to fill up the <code>inversedBy</code> &amp; <code>mappedBy</code> &amp; the rest of the class?</p>

<p>not clear without so much and deep thinking, abt 2 days. i guess </p>

<p><strong>then as practice how do i create a many to many self referencing relationship from scratch?</strong> </p>

<p>the example i am going to work on is... hmm, quite crappy i think but, i'll try :) ... 1 user/student can have many teachers. 1 teacher can have many users/students. 1 user can be a teacher and student here. u know like in forums such as these, when u answer someones questions, you are a teacher. when u ask, u are a student</p>

"3294358","<p>Hey everyone, I've been using PHPUnit to to do unit testing on a Symfony/Doctrine project I'm working on. It was working fine until yesterday when various classes dropped from 100% coverage to 98-99%. The reason for the change is because the opening left brace of these classes is no longer considered ""covered"" for some reason. Here's a screenshot of the issues: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Lpf7Z.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/iNKyh.png"" alt=""http://imgur.com/RCDzm.png""></a></p>

<p>I've tried everything but I can't figure out what causes some classes to have this issue while the others show ""complete"" coverage just fine. It's more of an annoyance than anything since the tests still run just fine but it'd be nice to know what is going on. I'm using PHP 5.3.2, PHPUnit v3.4.15, and Xdebug v2.1.0 in case that makes a difference.</p>

<p>Sebastian marked it as wontfix in PHPUnit and Derick say it's not a bug.</p>

  <p>This is not a bug. Xdebug can only scans items (files, functions, methods) when they are loaded and code coverage is enabled. The class file is loaded before code coverage is enabled, and is therefore not picked up in the coverage report. The methods are scanned when they are run as well, so it works there.</p>

I also turned off ""clip subviews"" to no avail.</p>

But watch out - this will make the text expand downwards indefinitely. So you will also need to surround your text field with a container view that DOES clip to bounds to set an upper limit.</p>

<p>If that doesn't do the trick, you will have to do some work to manually expand your text view's bounds and reposition it before animating if the new text is larger.</p>

<p>To get the size of a text, check out UIStringDrawing.h in the UIKit framework. Specifically, I'm thinking of using:
- (CGSize)sizeWithFont:(UIFont *)font forWidth:(CGFloat)width lineBreakMode:(UILineBreakMode)lineBreakMode;
together with UILineBreakModeWordWrap.</p>

<p>another alternative to getting the size may be this function in UILabel:
- (CGRect)textRectForBounds:(CGRect)bounds limitedToNumberOfLines:(NSInteger)numberOfLines;
and passing in the bounds of the largest possible text view.</p>

<p>For extra credit, you may also want to consider animating the change in your view's bounds for a smoother transition.</p>

","Positioning squares on a circle with minimum diameter","<algorithm><math><geometry>","2010-07-21 08:18:36","2759","3297441","6","<p><s>There may be a mathematically clever way to do this, but I wouldn't know.
I think it's complicated a bit by the fact that the geometry is different for every different number of squares; for 4 it's a rhombus, for 5 it's a pentagon and so on.</p>

<p>What I'd do is place those squares on a 1 unit circle (much too small, I know, bear with me) distributed equally on it. That's easy enough, just subtend (divide) your 360 degrees by the number of squares. Then just test all your squares for overlap against their neighbors; if they overlap, increase the radius.</p>

<p>You can make this procedure less stupid than it sounds by using an intelligent algorithm to approach the right size. I'm thinking of something like Newton's algorithm: Given two successive guesses, of which one is too small and one is too big, your next guess needs to be the average of those two.</p>

<p>You can iterate down to any precision you like. Stop whenever the distance between guesses is smaller than some arbitrary small margin of error.</s></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> I have a better solution:</p>

<p>I was thinking about what to tell you if you asked ""how will I know if squares overlap?"" This gave me an idea on how to calculate the circle size exactly, in one step:</p>

<p>Place your squares on a much-too-small circle. You know how: Calculate the points on the circle where your 360/n angles intersect it, and put the center of the square there. Actually, you don't need to place squares yet, the next steps only require midpoints.</p>

<p>To calculate the minimum distance of a square to its neighbor: Calculate the difference in X and the difference in Y of the midpoints, and take the minimum of those. The X's and Y's are actually just cosines and sines on the circle.</p>

<p>You'll want the minimum of <em>any</em> square against its neighbor (clockwise, say). So you need to work your way around the circle to find the very smallest one.</p>

<p>The minimum (X or Y) distance between the squares needs to become 1.0 . So just take the reciprocal of the minimum distance and multiply the circle's size by that. Presto, your circle is the right size.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Without losing generality, I think it's possible to nail my solution down a bit so it's close to coding. Here's a refinement:</p>

<ul>
<li>Assume the squares have size 1, i.e. each side has a length of 1 unit. In the end, your boxes will surely be larger than 1 pixel but it's just a matter of scaling.</li>
<li><p>Get rid of the corner cases:</p>

<pre><code>if (n &lt; 2) throw new IllegalArgumentException();
if (n == 2) return 0.5; // 2 squares will fit exactly on a circle of radius 0.5
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Start with a circle size <code>r</code> of 0.5, which will surely be too small for any number of squares > 2.</p>

<pre><code>r = 0.5;
dmin = 1.0; // start assuming minimum distance is fine
a = 2 * PI / n;
for (p1 = 0.0; p1 &lt;= PI; p1+=a) { // starting with angle 0, try all points till halfway around
   // (yeah, we're starting east, not north. doesn't matter)
   p2 = p1 + a; // next point on the circle 
   dx = abs(r * cos(p2) - r * cos(p1))
   dy = abs(r * sin(p2) - r * sin(p1))
   dmin = min(dmin, dx, dy)
}

r = r / dmin;
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I turned this into real Java code and got something quite similar to this to run. Code and results here: <a href=""http://ideone.com/r9aiu"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://ideone.com/r9aiu</a></p>

<p>I created graphical output using GnuPlot. I was able to create simple diagrams of boxes arranged in a circle by cut-and-pasting the point sets from the output into a data file and then running</p>

<pre><code>plot '5.dat' with boxxyerrorbars
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>.5</code>'s in the file serve to size the boxes... lazy but working solution. The .5 is applied to both sides of the center, so the boxes end up being exactly 1.0 in size.</p>

<p>Alas, <strong>my algorithm doesn't work</strong>. It makes the radii far too large, thus placing the boxes much further apart than necessary. Even scaling down by a factor of 2 (could have been a mistake to use 0.5 in some places) didn't help.</p>

<p><s>Sorry, I give up. Maybe my approach can be salvaged, but it doesn't work the way I had though it would. :(</s></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I hate giving up. I was about to leave my PC when I thought of a way to salvage my algorithm:</p>

<p>The algorithm was adjusting the <em>smaller</em> of the X or Y distances to be at least 1. It's easy to demonstrate that's just plain silly. When you have a lot of boxes then at the eastern and western edges of the circle you have boxes stacked almost directly on top of each other, with their X's very close to one another but they are saved from touching by having just enough Y distance between them.</p>

<p>So... to make this work, you must scale the <strong>maximum</strong> of dx and dy to be (for all cases) at least the radius (or was it double the radius?).</p>

<p>Corrected code is here: <s><a href=""http://ideone.com/EQ03g"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://ideone.com/EQ03g</a></s> <a href=""http://ideone.com/VRyyo"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://ideone.com/VRyyo</a></p>

<p>Tested again in GnuPlot, it produces beautiful little circles of boxes where sometimes just 1 or 2 boxes are exactly touching. <strong>Problem solved!</strong> :)</p>

"3300313","<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/MJu4t.png"" alt=""A tiny pointer problem :)""></p>

<p>So basically, I have two applications. <strong>Application 1</strong> launches <strong>Application 2</strong> but it remains in memory. When <strong>Application 2</strong> is started it needs to be given a pointer to a <em>CALayer</em> object which is stored in the first application. The object represented by the pointer needs to be accessible by <em>both</em> applications. I am using <em>Objective-C</em>. I would really appreciate any <em>examples</em>.</p>

<p>I need something more cross-platform and <em>Distributed Objects</em> are <em>Mac OS X</em> specific. And it is not a matter of me not knowing that CALayer's are Mac specific (<em>well kindof because of iOS</em>). I know that pretty damn well, it is just that I want to be using a cross-platform solution instead of a specific one.</p>
","Passing a pointer to an object onto a child application","<objective-c><pointers><object><shared-memory>","2010-07-21 14:28:13","401","3301055","4","<p>You will not be able to pass a pointer across application boundaries as the processes will have different address spaces.  If you need to refer to that object and initiate operations against it you will need to use a distributed object system or other interprocess communication layer.</p>

<p>The impression I get is that you want to spawn the child process, have it update some shared data structure and then exit.  One possibility would be to use a shared memory system such as <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man2/mmap.2.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mmap (2)</a> or <a href=""http://fscked.org/writings/SHM/shm-5.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">System V shared memory</a>.  Unfortunately portable shared memory is a bit harder to achieve across Windows and Unix/Linux, and you would probably have to make some platform specific wrappers.  <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366551%28VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This MSDN article</a> should give you a starter on a mmap-like facility on Windows, but I've never done shared memory on this platform so I can't really vouch for any of the ins and outs.</p>

<p>Another possibility would be to serialise the object and pass the serialised data structure between the processes with a pipe or other mechanism.  Again, doing this portably is somewhat fraught as IPC on Unix and Windows works quite differently.</p>

<p>Note that with shared memory, the object will have to be initialised within the shared memory pool, which means that this will have to be allocated first.  Otherwise you will need to copy the data in and out of the shared pool explicitly.  If the data structure has any pointers within it then this movement will break the pointers.  </p>

<p>The latter point also means that the parent ahd child process will also need to map the shared memory into the same virtual address if you intend to follow pointers within the shared data structure.  The alternative if you need references within the data structure is to implement them as handles or offsets from a base.  This will complicate the code that builds your data structure so mapping to the same address so you can use pointers is a win.</p>

<p>Also swot up on security of files used for mmap if you decide to use this.</p>

Lexically, Chrome on Windows will accept the <code>-webkit-optimize-contrast</code> value in a CSS style sheet, but it won't have any effect. It is my expectation that it will work someday, and this method will be the right way to get nearest neighbor upscaling, but for now, using this method means Windows Chrome users will have to live with the blurriness.</p>

<p>In an earlier post I got this as a reply on how to get a border in Tkinter similar to the one pictured below. I am not familiar with Tcl and it's extensions. So how would go about doing this? The end goal is basicaly to get the border below on a Tkinter window. </p>

<p><strong>Edit :</strong></p>

<p>I used the following on Windows 7 and it didn't seem to change the style. It's probably missing something. Any help would be appreciated, this could be really cool!  </p>

<pre><code>import string, win32ui, win32con
import Tkinter as tk

root = tk.Tk()

frame = win32ui.CreateWindowFromHandle(string.atoi(root.wm_frame(), 0))
frame.ModifyStyle(win32con.WS_CAPTION, 0, win32con.SWP_FRAMECHANGED)

","Using TCL extensions to set native window style in Tkinter","<python><tkinter><tcl>","2010-07-22 06:09:46","1356","7077371","2","<p>You can do this using a combination of the Python win32 api packages and Tkinter. What you need to know is that a Tk window is the client section of a Win32 window. The window manager interactions are handled using a wrapper that is the parent of Tk window itself. If you have a Tkinter window 'w' then you can create a PyWin32 window for the frame or just manipulate it directly. You can get the frame hwnd using w.wm_frame() and parsing the hex string returned or by using GetParent on the winfo_id value from the Tk window (although wm_frame is likely to be more reliable).</p>

<pre><code>import string, win32ui, win32con
from Tkinter import *
w = Tk()
frame = win32ui.CreateWindowFromHandle(string.atoi(w.wm_frame(), 0))
frame.ModifyStyle(win32con.WS_CAPTION, 0, win32con.SWP_FRAMECHANGED)
</code></pre>

<p>This removes the WS_CAPTION style and notifies the window that its frame is modified which forces a geometry recalculation so that the change propagates to the Tk child window.</p>

<p>EDIT ---
The following arranges to ensure we modify the window style <em>after</em> the window has been fully created and mapped to the display.</p>

<pre><code>import string, win32ui, win32con
from Tkinter import *

def decaption(event):
    w = event.widget
    frame = win32ui.CreateWindowFromHandle(string.atoi(w.wm_frame(), 0))
    frame.ModifyStyle(win32con.WS_CAPTION, 0, win32con.SWP_FRAMECHANGED)
    w.bind(""&lt;Map&gt;"", None)

root = Tk()
root.bind(""&lt;Map&gt;"", decaption)
root.mainloop()

"3306920","<p>I have a form which includes a JQUERY datepicker attatched to an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> on the form. My problem at the moment is that since the input is a text-box, most major browsers attempt to auto-complete entries for the user, which looks very silly over the datepicker:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/iymrl.jpg"" alt=""(The auto-complete box appearing over the date-picker.)""></p>

<p>Browsing the internet, I discovered that way back in the days of IE-5, Microsoft had an attribute for input tags called ""autocomplete"", which could disable it. However, that was way back then, and that was IE. Checking on W3Schools revealed that HTML5 <em>also</em> includes an ""autocomplete"" attribute for input tags (yes, I was equally surprised that Microsoft was supporting HTML-5 way back in 1999...). However, our website is not on HTML5 yet, so I cannot rely on using the tag and assuming it will work. Taking these into consideration, how then does one disable auto-complete for a single input box in HTML4? Expected browsers are Chrome (latest), Firefox 3.6, Firefox 2.0 and - god help us - perhaps IE6 (although we have warned everyone that we aren't promising anything will actually work if they use IE6! ;) )</p>

<p>(By the way, for anybody worrying out there, I know that this is attempting to change a user's personal browser settings, which is a naughty thing to do normally. However, in this case I believe it's justified, especially considering 90% of my users won't know what auto-complete is or that it even can be turned off...)</p>

<p>The 'eclipse.exe' loads the 'eclipse.ini'. Here you can make comments with a <code>#</code> at the beginning of the line. This does not prove that eclipse uses a batch script for loading (to be sure one should look at the source), but it is an hint that the comment-assumption is valid.</p>

"3309685","<p>I am having some trouble understanding the MVC Pattern. I do understand we are trying to decouple the GUI from the business logic, although I'm having problems understanding how.</p>

<p>From what I understood, the <code>View</code>, is what the user sees. So it generally is the window/form. The <code>Controller</code> is inbetween the <code>View</code> and the <code>Model</code>. The Controller will make the data ""flow"" in both directions. It will also persist state when needed (if I have a wizard with 5 steps, it is the <code>Controller</code>'s responsability to ensure they are made in the correct order, etc). The <code>Model,</code> is where the core of my application logic lives.</p>

<p>Is this view correct?</p>

<p>To try to turn this into something more meaningful, I'll try to sketch out a simple example with WinForms(no ASP.NET or WPF, please! - to the java crowd, from what I come to understand, Swing works in a similar way to WinForms!), to see if I get it right, and I'll raise the questions I always come to while doing it.</p>

<hr>

<p>Let's assume I have a model that contains just a class (just to make it easier. I know it will make the example look dumb but its easier this way):</p>

<pre><code>class MyNumbers {
    private IList&lt;int&gt; listOfNumbers = new List&lt;int&gt; { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 };

    public IList&lt;int&gt; GetNumbers() {
        return new ReadOnlyCollection&lt;int&gt;(listOfNumbers);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now it's time to make my <code>Controller</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Controller
{
    private MyNumbers myNumbers = new MyNumbers();

    public IList&lt;int&gt; GetNumbers() {
        return myNumbers.GetNumbers();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>View</code> should just have a <code>ListBox</code> that has as items all the numbers retrieved in <code>MyNumbers</code>.</p>

<h2>Now, the first question arises:</h2>

<p>Should the <code>Controller</code> be responsible for creating <code>MyNumbers</code>? In this simple case, I think its acceptable(as <code>MyNumbers</code> will do exactly the same, no matter what, and has no associated state). But let's assume I would want to use for all the different Controllers my app has the same instance of <code>MyNumbers</code>. I would have to pass to this <code>Controller</code>(and all others that need it) that instance of <code>MyNumbers</code> that I want to use. Who is going to be responsible for that? In this WinForms examples, would that be the <code>View</code>? Or would that be the class that creates the <code>View</code>?</p>

<p>Turning the question around: what is the order of instantiation of these 3 parts? What is the code that the ""owner"" of the <code>MVC</code> called to create it?
Should the <code>Controller</code> create both the <code>View</code> and <code>Model</code>? Should the <code>View</code> instantiate the <code>Controller</code> and the <code>Controller</code> the <code>Model</code>?</p>

<h2>Second question:</h2>

<p>How is the <code>main</code> method supposed to look like, assuming I only want my application to have the <code>Use Case</code> this <code>Controller</code> portrays?</p>

<h2>Third:</h2>

<p>Why does in the following MVC diagram, the <code>View</code> have an arrow to the <code>Model</code>? Shouldn't the <code>Controller</code> be always the bridge between both <code>View</code> and <code>Model</code>?</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/ModelViewControllerDiagram2.svg/350px-ModelViewControllerDiagram2.svg.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<hr>

<p>I'll have one or two more questions, but they probably will make more sense asked after I understand this first detail. Or maybe after I understand that first question all the others tear apart.</p>

<p>Everything works correctly, save the following:</p>

<p>In the dialog is an option to delete the row from which the current dialog was opened from. After confirming, and deleting the row, the tab is refreshed and the new table is shown with the relevant row deleted.</p>

<p>Now, the problem is that after closing the dialog where I did the deletion (either though the JavaScript function that did the deleting, or manually via the close button on the dialog), the dialog retains the data from the deleted row.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<p>There are three rows listed;</p>

<p>Open dialog from row 2;</p>

<p>Delete;</p>

<p>Dialog closed from the JavaScript function, tab refreshes, now two rows;</p>

<p>The dialog open link in the second row (which used to be row 3) has the same dialog id as the one just opened;</p>

<p>Click open dialog link in row 2;</p>

<p>Dialog displays same as before - for old row 2, instead of current row 2;</p>

<p>Close dialog;</p>

<p>Click open dialog link in row 2;</p>

<p>Displays correctly - data from current row 2;</p>

<p>I don't know if that made any sense... Here's a picture of what happens:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/T9AX6.png"" alt=""Enter image description here""></p>

<p>So, the row below the row that gets deleted inherits the dialog id, and when clicked shows the old dialog. If closed, then re-opened, it shows the proper content in the dialog.</p>

<p>I'm using <code>dialog(""close"")</code> currently and have tried <code>dialog(""destroy"")</code>, but that totally kills it, and the row below doesn't open anything...</p>

<p>How can I fix this problem?</p>

"3314242","<p>For an app that I am writing I need to display several views (in my case images, yet I guess that should not matter all that much) in a style similar to the way images are displayed in the Fotos app for the iPad. Consider this graphic:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/WKorY.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/WKorY.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>Obviously on portrait view fewer slides can fit in per row than on Landscape view. What I have/want to do now:</p>

<ul>
<li>Animate the addition of each slide by using a sliding animation</li>
<li>I already have a UIView subclass that represents a slide and that responds to touches the way I need it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where I am unsure is as to what is the best way of actually putting the slides onto the screen. I was originally just going to loop through them and place them onto the viewControllers view using the Frame of each slide (then I can do a count and increase the y-value after every 5 slides or so). Yet if I do it like that, I fear that my View will basically only support one screen orientation as I would need to relayout all the slides if the orientation changes, which seems rather a waste of resources to me (?).</p>

<p>How would you solve this problem? Is there maybe any ""linebreak on overflow"" ability such as with CSS (where a container automatically drops onto the next line if the float property is set and the parent container does not provide enough space)?</p>

<p>I am surely not the first person to think about this :)</p>

<p>Thanks for your answers!</p>

If you want to make something that does that, you'll need to write code that lays out the slides. Here's a sample of the code I use to do it:</p>

<pre><code>CGRect frame = CGRectMake(margins.left, margins.top, cellSize.width, cellSize.height);
for (UIButton *button in self.buttons) {
    button.frame = frame;

    // Move frame to next position
    frame.origin.x += cellSize.width + cellSpacing;
    if (frame.origin.x + frame.size.width &gt; margins.left + contentWidth) {
        frame.origin.x = leftMargin;
        frame.origin.y += cellSize.height + cellSpacing;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm using UIButtons for each image, hence the self.buttons ivar. </p>

<p><strong>Yes, you will need to relayout when the screen orientation changes.</strong> To do that, have a method like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)layoutSubviews {
    [super layoutSubviews];
    [self layoutButtons];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which calls your layout code. In my case, it's <code>layoutButtons</code>. This is in a subclass of UIScrollView, so when the view is autoresized after an autorotation, the <code>layoutSubviews</code> method gets called.</p>

<p>If you're using a UIScrollView, make sure you update the self.contentSize ivar too.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>You would probably want to use classes too, inline styles for example only.</p>

<p>Also, a valid argument is to use an ordered list. This is easily done by wrapping those <code>p</code> elements in <code>li</code> elements, which in turn will be wrapped by an <code>ol</code> element. Be sure to use <code>ol { list-style: none; }</code>, otherwise you will get 2 sets of numbers!</p>

<p>As for adding the numbers, you could use server side script and a DOM parser or use JavaScript</p>

<pre><code>var p = document.getElementById('content').getElementsByTagName('p');

for (var i = 0; i &lt; p.length; i++) {
    p[i].getElementsByTagName('div')[0].innerHtml = '#' + (i + 1);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you can also use jQuery</p>

<pre><code>$('#content p').each(function(i) {

    $(this).find('div:first').html('#' + (i + 1));

});

<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k2w5ey1e.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Type.GetMembers</a> would probably be your best bet. You may need a second call to get any static methods as well:</p>

<pre><code>var instanceMembers = typeof(Color)
                      .GetMembers(BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.Public);

var staticMembers = typeof(Color)

<p>Each MemberInfo object will be able to tell you the MemberType (Property, Field, Method, Event, etc.)</p>

<p>Just use the <code>instanceMembers</code> when the user types a variable (like <code>c</code> in your example) followed by <code>.</code> and use the <code>staticMembers</code> when the user types a type name (like <code>Color</code> in your example) followed by <code>.</code>.</p>

"3322705","<p>I'm currently trying to create a ray tracer in C++ but I'm having difficulty writing the .bmp produced at the end. I'm determined to do it manually, so I can learn more about image files and writing them etc. But I'm having some difficulty. I'm fairly new to C++ but have been using Python for a while.  </p>

<p>I'm almost there now, I just have one strange problem. Everything is correct up to mid way trough the important colours (which I set to 0), where all sorts of random characters spring up and this continues for the next few bytes, a couple of bytes in to the pixel data. Before and after that everything is fine, but I just can't explain it. My current code is in the edit:</p>

"3325723","<p>I'm using GetPixel to get the colour of each pixel of an image. The images contain different plain-coloured irregular shapes, and I'd like to find the point (or pixel) where the maximum width matches the maximum height (see figure below).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/r4jnq.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Figure""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/r4jnq.jpg"" alt=""alt text"" title=""Figure""></a><br>

<p>(disregard the border)</p>

<p>I'm using this to iterate through the captured bitmap:</p>

<pre><code>        for (int x = 0; x &lt; bmp.Width; x++)
        {
            for (int y = 0; y &lt; bmp.Height; y++)
            {
                Color clr = bmp.GetPixel(x, y);

                // Hit
                if (TestColour(clr)) // See if we're within the shape. I'm just comparing a bunch of colours here.
                {
                    // Stuff I don't know
                }
            }
        }
</code></pre>

<p>I got it to work by using a hashTable, but I understand that it's an dawful solution. I was thinking in the lines of just having two integers (one for X, one for Y) increment and save the maximum value for each iteration, then compare this to the previous one and replace the value if it's higher.</p>

<p>I don't see how I'd be able to use that approach with my for-loops nested like that.</p>

<p>Any input?</p>
","Find pixel where max width and max height of a coloured area intersect using GetPixel()","<c#><image><loops><getpixel>","2010-07-24 15:50:07","1515","3326904","2","<p>It should be simple to find this point using two loops, similar to the loop you have. 
First, define your variables:</p>

<pre><code>//from http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Wiki/images/a/a3/Convex_polygon.png
Image image = Image.FromFile(@""C:\Users\Jacob\Desktop\Convex_polygon.png"");
Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(image);
Point maxPoint = new Point(0, 0);
Size maxSize = new Size(0, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>Next, I would recommend calling <code>GetPixel</code> only once per pixel, and cache the results in an array (this may be a bias from when I had to use an API call to get the pixel, but will prove easier to work with):</p>

<pre><code>Color[,] colors = new Color[bitmap.Width, bitmap.Height];
for (int x = 0; x &lt; bitmap.Width; x++)
{
    for (int y = 0; y &lt; bitmap.Height; y++)
    {
        colors[x, y] = bitmap.GetPixel(x, y);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next, here's a simple code to get the maximum height, and the X of the first point with that height:</p>

<pre><code>Color shapeColor = Color.FromArgb(245, 234, 229);

for (int x = 0; x &lt; bitmap.Width; x++)
{
    int lineHeight = 0;
    for (int y = 0; y &lt; bitmap.Height; y++)
    {
        if (colors[x, y] == shapeColor) // or TestColour(colors[x, y])
            lineHeight++;
    }
    if (lineHeight &gt; maxSize.Height)
    {
        maxSize.Height = lineHeight;
        maxPoint.X = x;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can make a similar loop for each y to find the maximal width.</p>

<p>An important point here: your question isn't defined for concave shapes - on concave shapes you will have a list of heights for every x, and the maximal height line may not intersect the maximal width. Even on convex shapes you may have more than a single answer: a simple example of it is a rectangle.</p>

<p>The ""A"" value in my image is the height of the button.  But, what I want to use for calculation and placement purposes is the B value. </p>

<p>Additionally, I'd like to perform similar calculations with the width; getting the width from the top right corner to the bottom left corner.</p>

<p>I put together a <a href=""https://www.dot-com-it.com/Technology/Flex/thanks.cfm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sample</a> to show off the various approaches for calculating this that people are suggesting.

For example, turn the rotationSlider to 85.  The button is effectively invisible, yet all approaches are still giving it height and width.  </p>

<p>The one thing the blog post doesn't say is that in many cases, the perspectiveProjection property of the transform property on the class in question will be null.  The linked to example took care of this by setting the <code>maintainProjectionCenter</code> property to true.  But, you could also create a new perspectiveProjection object like this:</p>

<p>Ok here is how I made it works. It seems that <code>#pages</code> and <code>#sidebar</code> they should be in separate <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag. The code (I deleted PHP from it)</p>

<p>HTML:</p>

<pre><code>
&lt;html>
&lt;head>(content)&lt;/head>
&lt;body> &lt;!-- never forget about body tags!!!!!!!!!-->
&lt;div id=""main"">
    &lt;!-- Menu Start -->
    (...)
    &lt;!-- Menu End --> 
    &lt;div id=""content""> &lt;!-- this is new -->
        &lt;div id=""posts"">
                   (content)
        &lt;/div>
        
        &lt;div class=""sidebar"">
                  (content)
        &lt;!-- Sidebar End  -->
        &lt;div class=""clr"" /> &lt;this is new>
    &lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/body>
&lt;
</code></pre>

<p>and CSS:</p>

<pre><code>
    \*{
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 0px;
}

body{
    background-color: #eeeeee;
}

\#menu {
    background-color: #282828;
    height:20px;
    width: 840px;
    padding: 10px;
    position: relative;
}

\#main {
    width: 860px;
    margin: 0 auto;
    background-color: #ffffff;
    -webkit-box-shadow: 2px 0px 5px #bbbbbb,-2px 0 5px #bbbbbb;
    -moz-box-shadow: 2px 0px 5px #bbbbbb,-2px 0px 5px #bbbbbb;

}
.sidebar {
    position: relative;

<p>in cocoa, I mean a custom list control. Do you know how this kind of things can be done?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your help,</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
","custom list control in cocoa","<cocoa><macos><list>","2010-07-25 13:48:19","2502","3331282","2","<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>
<p>NSTableView now supports view-based rows with variable heights:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><code>- (NSTableViewRowSizeStyle)rowSizeStyle</code></strong></p>
<p><strong>Return Value</strong><br />
The row style style. See <code>NSTableViewRowSizeStyle</code> for the supported options.</p>
<p><strong>Discussion</strong><br />
The row size style can be modified on a row by row basis by invoking the delegate method <code>tableView:heightOfRow:</code>, if implemented.</p>
<p>The <code>rowSizeStyle</code> defaults to <code>NSTableViewRowSizeStyleCustom</code>. <code>NSTableViewRowSizeStyleCustom</code> indicates to use the rowHeight of the table, instead of the pre-determined system values.</p>
<p>Generally, <code>rowSizeStyle</code> should always be <code>NSTableViewRowSizeStyleCustom</code> except for &quot;source lists&quot;. To implement variable row heights, set the value to <code>NSTableViewRowSizeStyleCustom</code> and implement <code>tableView:heightOfRow:</code> in the delegate.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong><br />
Available in OS X v10.7 and later.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>PXListView</strong> - An optimized list view control for Mac

subject.</p>
<p>PXListView is licensed under the New

<p>PXListView uses similar optimizations
as UITableView for the iPhone, by
enqueuing and dequeuing NSViews which
are used to display rows, in order to
keep a low memory footprint when there
are a large number of rows in the
list, yet still allowing each row to
be represented by an NSView, which is
easier than dealing with cells.</p>
<p>The architecture of the control is
based on the list view controls which
are present in both Tweetie (Mac) and
Echofon (Mac).</p>
<p>The project is still very much a work
in progress, and as such no
documentation exists at current.</p>

"3334232","<p>I have a J2EE project running on JBoss, with a maximum heap size of 2048m, which is giving strange results under load testing. I've benchmarked the heap and cpu usage and received the following results (series 1 is heap usage, series 2 is cpu usage):</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/UkLDp.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/UkLDp.png"" alt="""" /></a></p>

<p>It seems as if the heap is being used properly and getting garbage collected properly around A. When it gets to B however, there appears to be some kind of a bottleneck as there is heap space available, but it never breaks that imaginary line. At the same time, at C, the cpu usage drops dramatically. During this period we also receive an &quot;OutOfMemoryError (GC overhead limit exceeded),&quot; which does not make much sense to me as there is heap space available.</p>
<p>My guess is that there is some kind of bottleneck, but what exactly I can't even imagine. How would you suggest going about finding the cause of the issue? I've profiled the memory usage and noticed that there are quite a few instances of the one class (around a million), but the total size of these instances is fairly small (around 50MB if I remember correctly).</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The server is dedicated to to this application and the CPU usage given is only for the JVM (there should not be any significant CPU usage outside of the JVM). The memory usage is only for the heap, it does not include the permgen space. This problem is reproducible. My main concern is surrounding the limit encountered around B, for which I have not found a plausible explanation yet.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Turns out this was caused by a bunch of long running SQL queries being called concurrently. The returned ResultSets were also very large, possibly explaining the OOME. I still have no reasonable explanation for why there appears to be some limit at B.</p>
","Java heap bottleneck - how to identify the cause?","<performance><jakarta-ee><heap-memory><profile>","2010-07-26 11:04:56","2652","3334519","2","<p>From the error message it appears that the JVM is using the parallel scavenger algorithm for garbage collection. The message is dumped along with an OOME error when <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/hotspot/gc/gc_tuning_6.html#par_gc.oom"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a lot of time is spent on GC, but not a lot of the heap is recovered</a>.</p>

<p>The document from Sun does not specify if the 98% of the total time consumed is to be read as 98% of the CPU utilization of the process or that of the CPU itself. In either case, I have to draw the following inferences (with limited information):</p>

<ul>
<li>The garbage collector or the JVM process does not have enough CPU utilization, most likely due to other processes consuming CPU at the same time.</li>
<li>The garbage collector does not have enough CPU utilization since it is a low priority thread, and another memory intensive (but not CPU intensive) thread in the JVM is doing work at the same time, which results in the failure to de-allocate memory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the above inferences (all, one or none of them could be true), it would be worthwhile to correlate the graph that you're obtained with the runtime behavior of the application as far as users are concerned. In other words, you might find it useful to determine if other processes are kicked off (when your problem occurs), or the part of the application that is in operation (again, when the problem occurs).</p>

<p>In any case, the page referenced above, does give an option to disable the GC overhead limit used by the GC algorithm.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> If the problem occurs periodically, and can be reproduced, it might turn out to be a memory leak, otherwise (i.e. it occurs sporadically), you are better off tuning the GC algorithm or even changing it.</p>

<p>What I'm stuck at is that I need to create multiple thumbnails for each uploaded image (5 version to be precise with different settings eg. 150w, 250w,..) I created the presets but I can't seem to understand how imagecache works: it looks like the module builds the thumbnails only after I firs see the images, problem is that after I create the node I'm greeted with this view:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/8EhFo.gif"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>as you may notice some of the fields can have multiple images.
If I'm correct in my assumption that imagecache only builds thumb when you first access the node why I can't see the images but only the icons? Alternatively is it possible to force imagecache to create the different sizes as soon as the images are uploaded?
If not how does imagecache works?</p>

"3340226","<p>How does one tell the designer the default value of a Property when it is not one of the types supported by <code>DefaultValue()</code>? For instance, a <code>Padding</code>, or a <code>Font</code>.</p>

<p>Normally, when you use a Windows Forms control, the default values will be in a normal font in the Properties window, and changed (non-default) values will be in bold. E.g.</p>

<p><img src=""https://lh3.ggpht.com/_OWQZcvVlsnU/TE45hihWg3I/AAAAAAAABBA/Q_o_emAZ-uk/defaultProps.png"" alt=""Image of properties windows with non-default values in bold""></p>

<p>In this sample, the default value of <code>ShowAddress</code> is <code>false</code> and the default value of <code>ShowName</code> is <code>true</code>. This effect is achieved with the following:</p>

<pre><code>[DefaultValue(false)]
public bool ShowAddress {
  get { return mShowAddress; }
  set { 
    mShowAddress = value; 
    Invalidate();
  }
}

[DefaultValue(true)]
public bool ShowName { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>However, when I tried to do something for <code>Padding</code>, I failed miserably:</p>

<pre><code>[DefaultValue(new Padding(2))]
public Padding LabelPadding { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Which of course won't compile.</p>

<p>How on Earth would I do this?</p>

// next comes the magic
bool ShouldSerializeLabelPadding() { return LabelPadding != DefaultLabelPadding; }
</code></pre>

<p>The property browser looks for a function named <code>ShouldSerializeXYZ</code> for each property <code>XYZ</code>.  Whenever <code>ShouldSerializeXYZ</code> returns false, it doesn't write anything during code generation.</p>

"3340383","<p>I'm looking into Paxos and I'm confused about how the algorithm should behave in this contrived example. I hope the diagram below explains the scenario.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i96.photobucket.com/albums/l187/allen_a_george/StackOverflow/Strange_Paxos_Scenario.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>A few points:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each agent acts as a proposer/acceptor/learner</li>
<li>Prepare messages have form <code>(instance, proposal_num)</code></li>
<li>Propose messages have form <code>(instance, proposal_num, proposal_val)</code></li>
<li>Server1 and Server2 both decide to start the proposal process at the same time</li>
<li>In the beginning messages M1, M2 and M3 occur simultaneously</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems here that although the protocol is 'correct', i.e. only one value <code>S2</code> is chosen, Server1 and Server2 believe that it was chosen because of different proposal numbers.</p>

<p>Does the Paxos algorithm only terminate when the <code>Decide(...)</code> message is sent out to the learners? I must be misunderstanding <em>Paxos Made Simple</em> but I thought the choice was made the moment the proposers achieved quorum for their <code>Propose(...)</code> messages.</p>

<p>If the choice is only made after the <code>Decide(...)</code> message is sent out to the agents, should Server2 terminate its sending of <code>Decide(1, 5, S2)</code> when it recovers because it saw a later <code>Prepare(1, 7)</code>?</p>
","What is the proper behaviour for a Paxos agent in this scenario?","<algorithm><distributed><consensus><paxos>","2010-07-27 02:32:13","884","4394668","2","<p>Just gonna redefine the terms (let's also throw out the 1 because we're only examining one Paxos iteration):</p>

<p>1) Propose(n) == propose(n), message from a proposer with current identity n</p>

<p>2) AcceptPrepare(n,v) == ack(n,v), message sent to proposer n. v is blank if this node hasn't accepted any value yet, o.w. v equals the value it has accepted</p>

<p>3) CreateDecide(n,v) == accept!(x,v), asking the nodes to accept this value from proposer with identity x. nodes will reject the message if they've ack'ed a prepare(n) message where n > x</p>

<p>Once quorum is achieved for prepare(n) -- that is, a majority have ack'ed the message -- then the proposer with identity n sends out a command accept!(n,v). If a prepare(n+x), x > 0, was sent out by a proposer with identity n+x -- and it's ack'ed by a majority -- between the ack(n,v) messages and the accept!(n,v), then a majority has promised not to accept values proposed with a timestamp &lt; n+x, x > 0 (AKA the nodes will reject the accept!(n,v))</p>

<p>The choice is made as soon as a majority receives an accept!(n,v) message which they have not promised to ignore.</p>

<p>Thus, when server2 comes back online and it sends accept!(5,S2), it will be ignored because 5 &lt; 7.</p>

<p>Compile and drop it from the top of the toolbox onto your form.  It however cannot fix the fundamental problem, the ""Show window content while dragging"" option.  That's a system option, it will be turned on for later versions of Windows.  When it is on, Windows itselfs scrolls the content of the panel, then asks the app to draw the part that was revealed by the scroll.  The OnScroll method overrides that, ensuring that the entire window is repainted to keep the background image in place.  The end-result is not pretty, you'll see the image doing the ""pogo"", jumping up and down while scrolling.</p>

<p>The only fix for this is turning the system option off.  That's not a practical fix, users like the option and it affects every program, not just yours.  If you can't live with the pogo then you'll have to give up on the transparency.</p>

"3341900","<p>I have the following project structure using a Domain Model, StructureMap and Fluent NHibernate:</p>

<p><img src=""https://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/%5BWebsite%5D-%3E%5BDomain%5D,%20%5BWebsite%5D-%3E%5BStructureMap%5D,%20%5BStructureMap%5D-%3E%5BDomain%5D,%20%5BStructureMap%5D-Get%20concrete-%3E%5BFluent%20NHibernate%5D"" alt=""Project Structure""></p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that Fluent NHibernate requires all of the following to be the bin directory of the website for it to work at runtime:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Antlr3.Runtime.dll *</li>
  <li><strong>Castle.Core.dll</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Castle.DynamicProxy2.dll</strong></li>
  <li>FluentNHibernate.dll *</li>
  <li>Iesi.Collections.dll *</li>
  <li>log4net.dll *</li>
  <li><strong>NHibernate.ByteCode.Castle.dll</strong></li>
  <li>NHibernate.dll *</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem I'm having is that not all of these assemblies are output to my website's bin directory. Currently only the items with a <code>*</code> are output correctly. The items in <strong>bold</strong> are missing from the bin directory.</p>

<p>Now, I would of assumed that the reason for this is because I have not added them as references to my <code>Fluent NHibernate</code> project. The only references I currently have are to <strong><em>NHibernate.dll</em></strong> and <strong><em>FluentNHibernate.dll</em></strong>. These two references alone are enough to bring through the items marked with a <code>*</code>, but they do not bring through the missing items.</p>

<p>So, I then thought that to get them to all come through I'd just add them as references to the <code>Fluent NHibernate</code> project. Unfortunately, this made no difference; the same items were still missing from the bin directory.</p>

<p>I've never really understood how visual studios decides which assemblies to copy over. I always assumed it was any assembly marked as <em>Copy Local=true</em>, but this doesn't seem to be the case in this scenario.</p>

<p>Of course I could just add all the assembly references into <code>Website</code>, but then that'd completed defeat the point of loosely coupling the projects through <code>StructureMap</code>.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any idea why the assemblies are missing and how I can get them to copy over correctly?</p>
","Why are some references missed when running my application?","<visual-studio><nhibernate><visual-studio-2010><fluent-nhibernate><structuremap>","2010-07-27 08:36:21","222","3342173","1","<p>You can either add references to the project that requires those files be present in the output directory (Website in your case) or you can add a post-build step in your build script to copy them across.</p>

<p>This is a case of VS and the compiler being ""smart"" about whether references are actually required or not. The C# compiler optimizes out those references that aren't actually required. Adding a reference to non-required assembly in VS will ensure it appears in the output directory of that project. However, dependent projects will only get that same assembly if it's actually used by the project referencing it. That is, if the C# compiler hasn't optimized its reference out. That's why you would need to add the reference to the Website project, if you go that route.</p>

<p>Personally, I did exactly that. I don't really think this is tight coupling since NH still resolves the assemblies dynamically at runtime. And it's not like I can't just substitute in other byte code assemblies manually and restart my app. But it's also not like I <em>would</em> do that without adequate testing, so in a way I consider myself to be coupled to Castle on the basis of that. And, therefore, I'm not irked by the references.</p>

"3342121","<p>I apologize ahead of time, becuase I'm neither great at explaining things nor flow charts. This is not a specific code problem, but a general question on session security.</p>

"3347483","<p>I want to write a paint program in the style of MS Paint.</p>

<p>For painting things on screen when the user moves the mouse, I have to wait for mouse move events and draw on the screen whenever I receive one. Apparently, mose move events are not sent very often, so I have to interpolate the mouse movement by drawing a line between the current mouse position and the previous one. In pseudocode, this looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var positionOld = null

def handleMouseMove(positionNew):
    if mouse.button.down:
        if positionOld == null:
            positionOld = positionNew
        screen.draw.line(positionOld,positionNew)
        positionOld = positionNew
</code></pre>

<p>Now my <strong>question</strong>: interpolating with straight line segments looks too jagged for my taste, can you recommend a better interpolation method? What method do GIMP or Adobe Photoshop implement?</p>

<p>Alternatively, is there a way to increase the frequency of the mouse move events that I receive? The GUI framework I'm using is <a href=""https://www.wxwidgets.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wxWidgets</a>.</p>

<p>GUI framework: wxWidgets.<br>
(Programming language: Haskell, but that's irrelevant here)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Clarification: I want something that looks smoother than straight line segments, see the picture (original size):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/kfQDn.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/kfQDn.png"" alt=""jagged lines drawn between mouse positions""></a>
</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong> The code I'm using looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>-- create bitmap and derive drawing context
im      &lt;- imageCreateSized (sy 800 600)
bitmap  &lt;- bitmapCreateFromImage im (-1)    -- wxBitmap
dc      &lt;- memoryDCCreate                   -- wxMemoryDC
memoryDCSelectObject dc bitmap

...
-- handle mouse move
onMouse ... sw (MouseLeftDrag posNew _) = do
    ...
    line dc posOld posNew [color     := white
                          , penJoin  := JoinRound
                          , penWidth := 2]
    repaint sw                              -- a wxScrolledWindow

-- handle paint event
onPaint ... = do
    ...
    -- draw bitmap on the wxScrolledWindow
    drawBitmap dc_sw bitmap pointZero False []
</code></pre>

<p>which might make a difference. Maybe my choices of wx-classes is why I'm getting a rather low frequency of mouse move events.</p>
","Writing a paint program √† la MS Paint - how to interpolate between mouse move events?","<user-interface><wxwidgets><mouseover><interpolation><paint>","2010-07-27 20:04:58","3566","3520239","6","<p>Interpolating mouse movements with line segments is fine, GIMP does it that way, too, as the following screenshot from a very fast mouse movement shows:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/aI8xi.png"" alt=""GIMP uses line segments, too""></p>

<p>So, smoothness comes from a high frequency of mouse move events. WxWidgets can do that, as the example code for a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3484058/example-code-for-a-minimal-paint-program-ms-paint-style/3487944#3487944"">related question</a> demonstrates.</p>

<p>The problem is in your code, Heinrich. Namely, drawing into a large bitmap first and then copying the <em>whole bitmap</em> to the screen is not cheap! To estimate how efficient you need to be, compare your problem to video games: a smooth rate of 30 mouse move events per second correspond to 30fps. Copying a double buffer is no problem for modern machines, but WxHaskell is likely not optimized for video games, so it's not surprising that you experience some jitter.</p>

<p>The solution is to draw only as much as necessary, i.e. just the lines, directly on the screen, for example as shown in the link above.</p>

    indentedTextWriter.Close();

"3353932","<p>I'm still very new to Object Oriented programming and am having problems with the class inheritance and the scope of variables from one instantiated class to another.</p>

<p>I'm trying to build an android application that can read multiple XML feeds and save them to the phone's SQLite database. Each feed has a different name (""news"", ""audio_mixes"" etc.) and I want to use these names to save each feed's data into separate database tables - each one named after the feed title.</p>

<p>In diagrammatic terms this is what my classes look like:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/FN8tL.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/FN8tL.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></a><br>
<sub>(source: <a href=""http://baroquedub.co.uk/private/images/Main-Title_Browser.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">baroquedub.co.uk</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p><strong>The Main activity</strong> displays two buttons each of which starts an activity - both of which are instances of the TitlesBrowser class. Extras are used to pass different values of <strong>the_url</strong> and <strong>the_feed_type</strong> variables.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
    public void onCreate(final Bundle icicle) {
        super.onCreate(icicle);
        this.setContentView(R.layout.main);

        this.getNewsButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.get_news_button);
        this.getNewsButton.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {

            public void onClick(final View v) {
                Intent doGetNews = new Intent(Main.this, TitlesBrowser.class);
                doGetNews.putExtra(""the_url"", Main.this.getString(R.string.titles_url));
                doGetNews.putExtra(""the_feed_type"", Main.this.getString(R.string.news_type_var));
                startActivity(doGetNews);
            }
        });

        this.getMixtapesButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.get_mixtapes_button);
        this.getMixtapesButton.setOnClickListener(new OnClickListener() {

            public void onClick(final View v) {
                Intent doGetMixtapes = new Intent(Main.this, TitlesBrowser.class);
                doGetMixtapes.putExtra(""the_url"", Main.this.getString(R.string.titles_url));
                doGetMixtapes.putExtra(""the_feed_type"", Main.this.getString(R.string.mixtapes_type_var));
                startActivity(doGetMixtapes);
            }
        });

    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The TitlesBrowser class</strong>, in its onCreate method, gets the Extras and saves them to private local variables. </p>

<pre><code>Intent i = getIntent();
private String theUrl = (String) i.getStringExtra(""the_url"");
private String theFeedType = (String) i.getStringExtra(""the_feed_type"");&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This class does two things, </p>

<p>1/ it creates an instance of the DatabaseHelper class, and uses a public set method in that class to pass on the value of the locally help <strong>theFeedType</strong> variable. Having done that it queries the database for any existing data (the <strong>theFeedType</strong> is the name of each table)</p>

<pre><code>db=new DatabaseHelper(this);
db.setTableName(theFeedType);

dbCursor=db.getReadableDatabase().rawQuery(""SELECT _ID, id, title FROM ""+theFeedType+"" ORDER BY id"",    null);
</code></pre>

<p>2/ then it loads new data from the feed URL by instantiating another class HTTPRequestHelper :</p>

<pre><code>HTTPRequestHelper helper = new HTTPRequestHelper(responseHandler);
helper.performPost(theUrl, theFeedType);
</code></pre>

<p>The HTTP requests work fine, and depending on which of the two buttons is clicked, each of the two different activities display the appropriate XML (i.e. retrieve the correct data)
- therefore I know that theUrl and theFeedType variables are local to each instance of the TitlesBrowser class.
One calls:</p>

<pre>http://baroquedub.co.uk/get-feed.php?feed=news</pre>

<p>and the other one:</p>

<pre>http://baroquedub.co.uk/get-feed.php?feed=audio_mixes</pre>

<p>The problem is with <strong>the DatabaseHelper class</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>public class DatabaseHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {
  private static final String DATABASE_NAME=""baroquedub.db"";
  private String table_name;


  public DatabaseHelper(Context context) {
    super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, 1);
  }

  @Override
  public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {
    db.execSQL(""CREATE TABLE ""+ table_name + ""(_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, "" +
                ""id INTEGER, "" +
                ""title TEXT, "" +
                ""details TEXT, "" +
                ""picture TEXT, "" +
                ""viewed BOOLEAN DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL);"");
  }

  @Override
  public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
    android.util.Log.w(""Baroquedub"", ""Upgrading database, which will destroy all old data"");
    db.execSQL(""DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mixtapes"");
    onCreate(db);
  }

  public void setTableName(String theName){
    this.table_name = theName;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would expect it to create a new table each time it is instantiated (whether ""news"" or ""audio_mixes"" was passed from its parent TitlesBrowser class. </p>

<p>But it only works once - if I start the application and click on ""news"" a table called news is created and each time I return to that activity it successfully retrieves data from that same database. </p>

<p>But if I then start the other activity by clicking on the other button (i.e access the other feed) I get an SQL error telling me that a database of that name doesn't exist.  In other words the onCreate db.execSQL(""CREATE TABLE... method doesn't appear to get called again. </p>

<p>It's as if multiple copies of the DatabaseHelper class aren't being created, although there are two instances of TitlesBrowser.</p>

<p>--
Here's a demonstration of the problem:</p>

<p><a href=""http://screencast.com/t/NDFkZDFmMz"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://screencast.com/t/NDFkZDFmMz</a> </p>

<p>This has been really tricky to explain (especially for a newbie!!!) and I hope it makes some sense. I'd be very grateful for any help, advice or guidance.</p>
","Object Oriented scope and inheritance in Android activity classes","<android><database><class><inheritance><oop>","2010-07-28 14:34:26","1609","3371305","2","<p>A big thank you to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/293929/adamk"">adamk</a> for providing the guidance necessary to solve this, in the answer he provided.</p>

<p>He suggested that I add two CREATE TABLE commands in the DatabaseHelper's onCreate method (on for each of my feeds). However, I needed to abstract things a little more so that I could still use multiple instantiations of the TitlesBrowser activity and so that I wouldn't have to rewrite the helper class every time a new feed came on board.</p>

<p>For those interested, here's the solution I came up with.</p>

<p>First of all, I removed the CREATE TABLE commands in the <strong>DatabaseHelper</strong>'s onCreate method. I also removed the private table_name variable (and its associated set method) and I replaced this with a public method called makeTable():</p>

<pre>public class DatabaseHelper extends SQLiteOpenHelper {
    private static final String DATABASE_NAME=""baroquedub.db"";

    public DatabaseHelper(Context context) {
        super(context, DATABASE_NAME, null, 1);
    }

    @Override
    public void onCreate(SQLiteDatabase db) {

    }

    @Override
    public void onUpgrade(SQLiteDatabase db, int oldVersion, int newVersion) {
        android.util.Log.w(""Baroquedub"", ""Upgrading database, which will destroy all old data"");
        db.execSQL(""DROP TABLE IF EXISTS mixtapes"");
        onCreate(db);
    }

    public void makeTable(String theTableName){
        SQLiteDatabase thisDB = DatabaseHelper.this.getWritableDatabase();
        thisDB.execSQL(""CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ""+ theTableName + ""(_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, "" +
                ""id INTEGER, "" +
                ""title TEXT, "" +
                ""details TEXT, "" +
                ""picture TEXT, "" +
                ""viewed BOOLEAN DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL);"");
    }
}</pre>

<p>In <strong>TitlesBrowser</strong>, rather than instantiating the DatabaseHelper, setting the table name and then reading in the data:</p>

<pre>db=new DatabaseHelper(this);
db.setTableName(theFeedType);

dbCursor=db.getReadableDatabase().rawQuery(""SELECT _ID, id, title FROM ""+theFeedType+"" ORDER BY id"",    null);</pre>

<p>Instead, I reworked all this so that it would more elegantly handle the creation and loading of the database data from each table:</p>

<ol>
<li>The database Helper is created as before,</li>
<li>then the new databaseLoad() method tries to read from the required table</li>
<li>and if it can't, it calls the DatabaseHelper's public makeTable() method,</li>
<li>before finally trying to load the data again:</li>
</ol>

<pre>   @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        Intent i = getIntent();
        theUrl = (String) i.getStringExtra(""the_url"");
        theFeedType = (String) i.getStringExtra(""the_feed_type"");

        // show saved in DB 
        db=new DatabaseHelper(this);
        databaseLoad();

    }

    private void databaseLoad(){
        try { // table exists
            dbCursor=db.getReadableDatabase()
                        .rawQuery(""SELECT _ID, id, title FROM ""+theFeedType+"" ORDER BY id"", null);

            displayContent();

        } catch (Exception e) { // table doesn't exist
            db.makeTable(theFeedType);
            databaseLoad(); // try again
        }
    }</pre>

","How to move multiple rectangles as collision response?","<c++><response><collision><irrlicht>","2010-07-28 15:00:21","1480","3379011","2","<p>Is this a sort of Sokoban game where the player can move in 8 directions, and is able to move several boxes at once? Is the play field viewed from birds eye view like in Sokoban, or are they falling boxes that we see in the example (side view, like in Tetris)? Is the friction between boxes and player infinite (in another words, is it forbidden for the box that player is touching to slide away from direction the player is moving, when it moves diagonally)? Is the friction between two boxes infinite?</p>

<p>I couldn't focus on your code, but here's my 2cents algorithm. The algorithm implies that friction between any two objects is infinite.</p>

<p>When player moves you need to establish which movable objects may be affected. Put the ones the player is touching in the moving direction into some <em>search stack</em>, then for each item in the search stack repeat the search process by putting more objects into it. Finally you'll run out of movable objects. If at any point you stumble upon a non-movable object then the player can't move as well (because of infinite friction rule), and so nothing moves. If there are no non-movable objects involved then move all objects in the stack by one grid unit.</p>

"3358188","<p>I have a tableview that is successfully incorporating an NSFetchedResultsController. However, I need the topmost cell in my tableview to read, ""Add new object"" and have UITableViewCellEditingStyleInsert instead of the default UITableViewCellEditingStyleDelete.</p>

<p>The FetchResultsController wants to check the managedObjectContext for objects--both to determine number of rows and to populate the table cells. The only way I can think to get around this is to create a dummy object, but I feel like there ought to be a more elegant solution.</p>

<h2>UPDATE:</h2>

<p>For those who might be curious as to what solution I ended up with, I decided to have my insert cell at the bottom, not the top. Here is the relevant code:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad {

    return 1;
}

- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {
    // Return the number of rows in the section.
    id &lt;NSFetchedResultsSectionInfo&gt; myClass = [[fetchedResultsController sections] objectAtIndex:section];
    NSLog(@""Number of classes = %d"", [myClass numberOfObjects]);

    return ([[fetchedResultsController fetchedObjects] count] + 1);

}

// Customize the appearance of table view cells.

    }

        NSLog(@""Class name is: %@"", theClass.classTitle);
        cell.textLabel.text = theClass.classTitle;
    }


    return cell;
}

<p>You can accomplish this by changing the <code>-tableView:numberOfRowsInSection:</code> and the <code>-tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> methods to adjust the cell count and adjust for it.  So your <code>-tableView:numberOfRowsInSection:</code> would return N+1 and your <code>-tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> would get object at N-1 unless N == 0 then it would return your ""Add new object"" cell.</p>

<p>There is no need to mess with the underlying Core Data elements as this is strictly a UI issue.</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>But now I'm not sure how to return the count of my fetched objects (assuming that is what I used for ""N"" in your above answer). Also, wouldn't I want -tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath to return my ""Add new object"" cell when the indexPath.row = (N + 1), not N = 0? I may be misunderstanding what ""N"" equates to, but I thought it just meant count of fetched objects. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes it is the count of actual objects.  </p>

<p>You do want your <code>-tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> to return a cell for your ""Add new object"" otherwise what is the point?  You just want it to return a <em>different</em> type of cell.  </p>

<p>All you are doing in this solution is adding a cell that is not part of the <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code> and then compensating for it when you are retrieving an actual object from the <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code> and when the user selects a cell.</p>

<p>I am developing a Client-Server based app using WPF, SQL-Server and WCF. This is basically a kind of POS application (not using any POS library but features are almost same). Server side coding is almost done. Now I am moving to client side coding. I am new in WCF (first app on WCF) and Client-Server architecture, so I surrounded by some doubts before I begin my coding. <strong>According to my Client (Person), he should be able to print item sales bill (Memo) from Client computers as well as Server. Every memo should have a Memo No for that transaction which should increment automatically and salesman should be able to see which memo no he is going to use</strong>. So for this purpose I have added a Memo No field on Application Sales Windows which would show Memo No (Last Memo No + 1) from database.</p>

<p>Here comes the problem, suppose there are 3 sales counters and when salesman opened their respective Sales Windows for billing then all of them would see (last Memo No + 1). And if 3 of them bill simultaneously then same memo no will be stored for 3 different transactions. </p>

<p>I must tell you that I have 2 tables in database to store sales. Table 1 stores discount, grand total, salesman id and <strong>Memo no</strong> and Table 2 stores memo no, item code, quantity, bill date etc. So its <strong>Memo no</strong> which binds two tables and if this get manipulated then you know what mess it can create in Monthly Reports.</p>

<p>This situation in overflowing my brain and came here to get solution. What I can do to overcome this. Any suggestion, link, code will be very helpful.</p>

<p>One way to implement this would be to use another table to store the sequence of memo numbers:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE MemoSequence
(MemoId int identity(1,1),
 DateAssigned datetime
)
</code></pre>

<p>Each time the sales window is opened on the client, the current date/time should be inserted into MemoSequence.DateAssigned, and the corresponding MemoId value returned (using an <code>OUTPUT</code> clause or <code>SCOPE_IDENTITY()</code>) to the client as the MemoId.</p>

<p>That way, each client would get a unique memo number assigned from the start of the transaction.</p>

<p>NB - this may not be a suitable solution if it is a requirement that there are no gaps in the sequence of Memo numbers.</p>

I would also like to avoid some type of report.   I don't need an actual solution just need to know <em>if its possible</em>.  So if you say SQL if you can give me a 2 table example of showing a root a leave I would be happy.</p>

<p>Structure is pretty general</p>

<p>And each table is linked through a surrogate key CompanyID, CompanyGroupID, etc.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on ways we could display/query for this data? Last resort is to write a quick C# Windows Application...</p>

<p>We would like to see it in tree form:</p>

<pre><code>--                      1-Company
--                     /        \
--             CompanyGroupA   CompanyGroupB
--            /       \              \
--  CompanyStoreA1 CompanyStoreA1 CompanyStoreB
--    /      \            /    \
--Employee   A            B     C   
</code></pre>

<p>In attempt to please the masses here is an example test script to populate the query.</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @Company table (id int, name varchar(40) )
INSERT @Company VALUES (1,'Living Things' )  
INSERT @Company VALUES (2,'Boring Company' )  


DECLARE @CompanyGroup table (id int, name varchar(40), CompanyID int)
INSERT @CompanyGroup VALUES (1,'Pets',1 ) 
INSERT @CompanyGroup VALUES (2,'Humans',1 ) 
INSERT @CompanyGroup VALUES (3,'Electronics',2 ) 
INSERT @CompanyGroup VALUES (4,'Food',2 ) 


DECLARE @CompanyStore table (id int, name varchar(40), CompanyGroupID int)
INSERT @CompanyStore VALUES (1,'PetsStoreA',1 ) 
INSERT @CompanyStore VALUES (2,'PetsStoreB',1 ) 
INSERT @CompanyStore VALUES (3,'PetsStoreC',1 ) 
INSERT @CompanyStore VALUES (4,'PetsStoreD', 1) 
INSERT @CompanyStore VALUES (5,'HumansStore',2 ) 
INSERT @CompanyStore VALUES (6,'FoodStore',3 ) 
</code></pre>

<p>The final solution was pretty awesome I modified the usp_DrawTree to accept varchar vs ints because i had to make my query ids unique.  I then just did a select/union all and built the parent child relationship.</p>

<p>Please see the screenshot above. The left part is WM 6 and the right is WM 6.5.3. In 6.5.3 there's an auto layout engine that fiddles with all controls to make them more touch-friendly. My documentation says this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, Auto Layout is disabled for third-party applications. However. application developers can enable this feature by setting the following style flag in their application: DS_EX_AUTOTOUCHLAYOUT (0x00200000L). When enabled, the Auto Layout engine will automatically set the style flag for each control so that the application supports finger-touch capabilities.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The DS_EX_AUTOTOUCHLAYOUT flag is defined in my 6.5.3 DTK headers:</p>

<pre><code>#define DS_EX_AUTOTOUCHLAYOUT   0x01000000L
</code></pre>

<p>(Note that the doc and header value differ)</p>

<p>But no matter how I try to use that flag with forms (custom window class) or dialogs (DIALOG window class) from native or managed code, I just cannot get the look at the right side above for my ListView items. I only get the ordinary thin (height-wise) solid background items.</p>

<p>I've looked at 10 or so MS apps in the emulator with Remote Spy and some are owner drawn, but not even the majority, so that cannot be what's causing the snazzy looks. I cannot find any other consistent pattern either when looking at the MS supplied apps in Remote Spy.</p>

<p>How can I get my apps to behave as touch-friendly as the MS ones, and also look as nice?</p>

"3383143","<p>I'm wondering how one would implement an outline view like the one Xcode 3 is using for the build configuration:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/eWMO3.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/eWMO3.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>When using an NSOutlineView/NSTableView with bindings and an NSTreeController/NSArrayController, the <strong>view's columns get bindings assigned to</strong>, not the individual cells, for obvious reasons.
If every row in a column uses the same cell, then it's a piece of cake. However if <strong>every row (potentially) uses its own cell type</strong> (and with that potentially its very own collection of bindings), then things get funky.</p>

<p>Looking at the screenshot one can clearly see that the textfield cell needs just a single binding for ""value"". While the popup button cell needs at least one for ""<strong>content</strong>"", one for ""<strong>contentValues</strong>"" and last but not least one binding for ""<strong>selectedIndex</strong> / <strong>selectedObject</strong> / <strong>selectedValue</strong>"". And the checkbox cell needs a binding for ""<strong>value</strong>"" and (probably) one for ""<strong>title</strong>"".</p>

<p>How would one accomplish this with as clean (and little) code as possible?<br>
(<em>Or as one might ask:</em> <strong>How would Apple have done it</strong>?)</p>

<p>‚Ä¶ </p>

<p>Here's what I've tried myself so far:<br>
I provide the appropriate (copied) cells via <strong>[outlineView:dataCellForTableColumn:item:]</strong> and bind them to the individual data models (from [item representedObject]).
I know the exact amount of data (&lt; 500 rows) being displayed in the outline view, so having one cell per row shouldn't be too much of a memory issue, no?
I got the <strong>data to get displayed properly</strong> via bindings (yay!) however I'm unable to change any of their values. O_o
Apparently the value change simply never gets thru to the data model. Is there more to it than a simple <strong>[checkboxCell bind:@""value"" toObject:rowModel withKeyPath:@""value"" options:nil]</strong>? (as this seems <strong>sufficient</strong> for <strong>getting</strong> values, but not for <strong>setting</strong> them accordingly.)</p>

<p>I couldn't find any information on this topic. Lots of info and hints for using custom cells per column, but none for using them on a ""per row"" basis. :(<br>
This would make some great stuff for a Cocoa tutorial, wouldn't it? ;)</p>
","Implementing NSOutlineView/NSTableView with different cells (and data types) per row","<cocoa><cocoa-bindings><nstableview><nsoutlineview><custom-cell>","2010-08-01 18:05:47","3424","3383387","1","<p>The data cell of a column isn't copied. The cell is configured for the proper value for the column in each row and drawn in its proper place. A good place to hook in is at the NSTableColumn method <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/mac/library/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Classes/NSTableColumn_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSTableColumn/dataCellForRow:"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">-dataCellForRow:</a>. In a custom subclass, you could override this method and pass either its -dataCell for normal operation or some alternate cell type.</p>

<p>I had an occasion to have a checkbox column representing ""include"" in an outline view that only appeared for children (non-root items). The root items couldn't be excluded, only their children, so it made sense only to show the checkbox for non-root items.</p>

<p>I created a custom NSTableColumn subclass that took a delegate (my data source controller) and checked to see if it responded to the selector -deadCellColumn:shouldShowDeadCellForRow:. If it did, I called that method (which was implemented on my data source controller) to ask it if I should show a ""dead cell"" (a basic NSCell subclass that draws nothing) and swapped it according to the answer. If the delegate didn't respond to the selector, the table column returns its normal -dataCell.</p>

<p>The custom cell (which I called ""DeadCell"") was needed here because I wanted to ensure nothing got drawn and nothing was editable. I'm not sure it was strictly necessary but I did it anyway. This isn't much use in your case, but I wanted to state it anyway for completeness.</p>

<p>Your situation is a bit more complicated, especially because Bindings are involved (and different data cell types can have different bindings for their value -- popups can be especially challenging). In my case, I eschewed bindings for the tried-and-true data source mechanism. It simplified things greatly. :-) For your case, it's easy enough to swap cell types around using data source methods.</p>

"3384046","<p>I have an element that contains two span tags that each contain some text. The container element sets a font size, then the font size on the second span tag is set to a lower size. When the second span is reduced in font size, the space between the line and the next block element is increased. This occurs in both WebKit and Gecko.</p>

<p>The <code>p</code> container element has <code>{ margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 10px; }</code> and its following sibling has <code>{ margin-top: -5px; }</code></p>

Thus, extra space is added below the baseline.</p>

"3384516","<p>I have started working on what I expect to become, by far, the largest project I‚Äôve ever done, and I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that I really need to start using some kind of version control beyond my current dated zip files and a txt file of comments. I‚Äôve looked into a number of different options but I‚Äôm just not finding anything that I feel is a fit for me. </p>

<p>One of my big complaints is the total lack of a quality GUI in any of the available options, TortoiseSVN seems to be the best of what‚Äôs out there, and is still terribly unintuitive (I have nothing against FOSS, but this does seem to be a common problem among OSS projects).  Reading the guides and manuals for SVN and other version control systems feels to have a complexity level akin to learning a new programming language.
I‚Äôm a solo developer, so I require very limited (if any) merge support and branching capabilities, no real need for multi-user systems, I have no need for distributed repositories. Basically what I would like is something akin to an automation of my zipping process with organizational support, commenting and basic diff options.</p>

<p>I have been toying with the idea of rolling my own program to fit my needs, to those ends I tossed together a very basic GUI mock-up to figure out what it would look like. Please ignore any spelling and organization/logic mistakes.</p>

<p>Please see mock-up here:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/TDEzP.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>This is little more then a ""napkin sketch"" really. The way I envision functionality is that you would drag a version out of the tree and drop it where you wanted it. It would create a directory containing that version of your project. There would be a hidden file with in the directory that would contain the version information. When you wanted to create a new version, you would drag and drop that folder into the tree view. If you were working with a Version that was not the most current it would create a branch. It would check for file changes/moves/renames and prompt for general version, and specific file comments.</p>

<p>My Question here is multifold. Is there anything out there similar to what I‚Äôm looking for? (I‚Äôm open to reasonably priced non-free options). 
If not, <strike>is this a worthwhile project? If so</strike> would there be any call for this kind of a program in the programming community at large that would make it worthwhile to polish the program as an end user product? </p>

<p><strong>@josh3736</strong><br> <strong><em>right now, now, yet</em></strong> -- I know what you mean here; I would consider multi-user support as something I would be adding to the system in a later version, and would plan accordingly. As for merge support, I would never work with more than a small team on any of my projects and thus would have no need for anything more than the basic merge support. <strong><em>thus far</em></strong> -- I guess it would have been more clear to say that I disagree with the concepts behind Distributed Repositories and simply would not use them. I‚Äôm not arguing the need and usefulness of these features in a large business project, or in a large FOSS project ‚Äì but I wouldn‚Äôt use Oracle to keep track of my friend‚Äôs phone numbers. While a custom GUI is a good suggestion, it really isn‚Äôt a project for me. IMHO it exemplifies what I see as the primary problem in the development of OSS systems such as SVN, being built from various components wrapped around and built on top of one another leads to a highly unintuitive system (in general, not just the GUI) with no clear design or focus. </p>

If you're on Windows, <a href=""http://www.visualsvn.com/server/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">VisualSVN</a> (free) makes setting up a server pretty painless.</p>

<p>I now create a SVN repository for even the simplest of projects.  Even on one-man projects, the ability to check out a working copy on multiple computers is wonderful.  That way, I can work on my project from my desktop or my laptop without worrying about keeping straight which computer has the most recent version of which file.  Just update, merge, and get on with my life.</p>

<pre><code>if(position&gt;21){
    position=0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>this should be removed as it should be handled by the checkPosition function.</p>

<p>In checkPosition:</p>

<p>For the modulus operator (<code>%</code>), given <code>a % b</code> if <code>0 &lt;= a &lt; b</code> then the result will be <code>a</code>. For <code>b &lt;= a &lt; 2*b</code> then the result will be <code>a-b</code>, so if <code>b == a</code>, then the result is <code>0</code>. This continues for any positive integer, so the check should be:</p>

<pre><code>if (position &gt; 0)
    position = position % mImageIds.length;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, what you are missing from this is handling the case where <code>position &lt; 0</code>.</p>

<pre><code>a    a%3    a    a%3    f(a)
0    0      0    0      0
1    1     -1   -1      2
2    2     -2   -2      1
3    0     -3    0      0
4    1     -4   -1      2
5    2     -5   -2      1
6    0     -6    0      0
</code></pre>

<p>What we want in this case is for it to wrap back around to the end of the list -- the <code>f(a)</code> in the table above.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the table above, if <code>a</code> is negative then <code>-b &lt; a &lt;= 0</code>. Also, if we make <code>f(a) = (a % b) + b</code> we get our desired result.</p>

<p>This means that the logic in checkPosition becomes:</p>

<pre><code>position = position % mImageIds.length;
if (position &lt; 0)
    position = position + mImageIds.length;
</code></pre>

<p>which should work for all values of <code>position</code> irrespective of the value of <code>mImageIds.length</code>.</p>

","Eclipse help won't show under Ubuntu","<eclipse><ubuntu>","2010-08-03 12:36:25","5936","5171066","6","<p>I know this is a late answer, but I had the same problem and resolved it, so to tie up this one...</p>

<p>This is a combination of two bugs:</p>

<p>(i) Eclipse's internal help browser doesn't use the Eclipse proxy settings! See:
<a href=""https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=318969"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=318969</a></p>

<p>(and the bugs referenced in comment #7 therein)</p>

<p>(ii) Ubuntu's proxy support is horribly broken in certain subtle ways. See:
<a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/300271"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+bug/300271</a></p>

<p>The fix/workaround is to manually set the no_proxy environment variable before running eclipse (as reported in the Eclipse #308035 bug referenced from the 318969 one) e.g.</p>

<pre><code>export no_proxy=127.0.0.1,localhost
eclipse &amp;
</code></pre>

<p>Help then launches correctly within Eclipse. Of course, once Eclipse is launched (thus running its own internal HTTP server), you can also access the local help manually from another browser (or, if within the 'can't access 127.0.0.1' screen, there's an icon at the top to launch in an external window --> default system browser).</p>

<p>This may well apply on other Linux distros using Gnome.</p>

"3398363","<p>During the most recent Google IO, there was a presentation about implementing restful client applications. Unfortunately, it was only a high level discussion with no source code of the implementation.</p>

<p>In this diagram, on the return path there are various different callbacks to other methods. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/7y0wd.gif"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/7y0wd.gif"" alt=""google io presentation slide""></a></p>

<p><strong>How do I declare what these methods are?</strong> </p>

<p>I understand the idea of a callback - a piece of code that gets called after a certain event has happened, but I don't know how to implement it. The only way I've implemented callbacks so far have been overriding various methods (onActivityResult for example).</p>

<p>I feel like I have a basic understanding of the design pattern, but I keep on getting tripped up on how to handle the return path.</p>
","How to Define Callbacks in Android?","<android><callback>","2010-08-03 15:59:18","263583","3398416","7","<p>In many cases, you have an interface and pass along an object that implements it. Dialogs for example have the OnClickListener.</p>

<p>Just as a random example:</p>

<pre><code>// The callback interface
interface MyCallback {
    void callbackCall();
}

// The class that takes the callback
class Worker {
   MyCallback callback;

   void onEvent() {
      callback.callbackCall();
   }
}

// Option 1:

class Callback implements MyCallback {
   void callbackCall() {
      // callback code goes here
   }
}

worker.callback = new Callback();

// Option 2:

worker.callback = new MyCallback() {

   void callbackCall() {
      // callback code goes here
   }
};

<p>I probably messed up the syntax in option 2. It's early.</p>

"3399558","<p>So in winforms, every dropdown combobox has this little arrow thingy to the right that tells the user it's a dropdown, kinda like this:</p>

</p>

<p>Now how do I figure out how wide that is in pixels? Reason is, I'm using ControlDrawToBitmap, this doesn't draw the text properly for the combo boxes, and I can redraw the contents, I just whack some of the arrows (which are drawn properly).</p>
","width of the dropdown arrow","<c#><vb.net><winforms>","2010-08-03 18:27:29","3480","3399733","2","<p>First idea that comes to mind: Check to see if the combobox button width tracks with the scrollbar width.  The scrollbar width can be modified in user preferences.  Use GetSystemMetrics() API to get the width of the various scrollbar pieces.  If you change your system scrollbar width and it does not affect the size of a normal combobox, then ignore this.</p>

<p>Second idea: use the edit control's formatting rect to find out what the edit control thinks is the usable display area (minus the combo box).  See <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb761596%28v=VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">EM_GETRECT in MSDN</a>.</p>

<p>However, it sounds like this is just a hack workaround for your real problem:  If you could get the controls to draw correctly to bitmap, then you wouldn't need this hackery.</p>

"3399875","<p>I'm designing a website which has fixed elements on the outer edges of a fixed-width layout. A div in the center is reserved for the content.</p>

<p>When the user scrolls, I want all of the content (besides said fixed outer navigation elements) to stay within the borders of that center element.</p>

<p>Here's a quick mockup of what I mean:

</p>

<p>I could very easily set the overflow property of the center element to auto, and have everything remain inside. However, it's very important that a scroll bar not be present on the edge of that element.</p>

<p>Basically, I'm wondering how to either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Restrict content to that area
(perhaps I could change the size and
positioning of the body element -- is
that allowed? -- and then position
the fixed elements outside of the
body.</li>
<li>Hide the scroll bar that appears
inside the div when using
overflow:auto</li>

","Scroll page content within specific area?","<html><css>","2010-08-03 19:01:41","4771","3400451","1","<p>If possible, you should break your fixed position elements up into 4 separate sections (top, left, right and bottom).  Then just make sure you pad you centre content area by their respective widths and heights so the content doesn't get overlapped:</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;!-- 4 fixed position elements that will overlap your content --&gt;
&lt;div id=""top""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""left""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""right""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=""bottom""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=""content""&gt;
  &lt;!-- Your content --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

<p><strong>CSS</strong></p>

<pre><code>html, body {
  height: 100%;   
}

#top, #left, #right, #bottom {
  position: fixed;
  left: 0;
  top: 0;
  z-index: 2;
  background: red;
}

#top, #bottom {
  width: 100%;
  height: 20px;
}

#bottom {
  top: auto;
  bottom: 0;

#left, #right {
  height: 100%;
  width: 20px;

#right {
  left: auto;
  right: 0;
}

#content {
  position: relative;

<p>You can see it <a href=""http://jsfiddle.net/46adS/"" rel=""noreferrer"">in action here</a>.</p>

<p>Also note the position: relative on the content area.  This is so z-index works correctly and the content is displayed below the fixed sections.</p>

One of the options the wizard offeres is ""Find a record on my form based on the value I select in my combobox"". If your form is complex, you may not see this option, in which case create a simple form to see the wizard and generate sample code - not always the best code, but certainly very useful.</p>

<p>There are a few small things that may or may not trouble you, for example, if the user moves to a record without using the combo, the combo does not change to show the new record, but this is very easy to fix with a little code in the current event for the form. </p>

<p>Here's a div-based approach:</p>

<p><em>It happened to be the case that these div-based approaches worked well enough in IE 7 and IE8, but not Firefox</em>

<p>The way it works is with a main <code>#wrap</code> element that centres the content and creates a coordinate map for the absolutely positioned <code>#main</code> element.  It does this because of its position: relative CSS rule.  You end up with the following markup:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""wrap""&gt;
    &lt;header&gt;&lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;div id=""main""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>header</code> is then placed inside of this and given position: relative and a z-index to set it stacking above the <code>#main</code> container.</p>

<p>Finally <code>#main</code> is absolutely positioned below the <code>header</code>.  The CSS looks like so:</p>

<pre><code>/* centre content and create coordinate map for absolutely positioned #main */
#wrap {
    width: 300px;
    margin: 20px auto;
    position: relative;
}

<p>Usually when it comes to traversing a tree, you don't have too many chances of optimizing, because starting at a node, you only have the options to visit the parent node or the child nodes. (As opposed to a graph, where you might apply <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dijkstra's algorithm</a>)</p>

<p>Just try it, i would recommend recursion.</p>

<p>A Node usually looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class Node {
  public String value; //contains ""C"" or ""D"" etc
  public List&lt;Node&gt; children = new ArrayList&lt;Node&gt;();
  public Node parent;
  public Node(Node parent){
    this.parent = parent;
  }
  public Node(Node parent, String value){
    this.parent = value;
    this.value = value;
  }
  public boolean equals(Object n){//Nodes are equal if they have the same value
    return value.equals(((Node)n).value);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If the question is to find the minimum number of steps from A to B (which is the distance), i would implement a <code>distanceTo</code> Method that traverses the tree and looks for the target Node until it is found. If you never worked with trees before, that might be a bit tricky.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, since you never worked with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Trees</a> before:
A tree is a data structure that contains a certain amount of Nodes. The connections between the Nodes are represented by references between the Nodes.
Each Node has a reference to it's parent Node (the one above) and a list of child nodes (the nodes below). A Node can only have one parent, but any number of children. A node without any children is called a leaf. The root node is usually identifyable because it's <code>parent</code> attribute is <code>null</code> (because the root, which is the topmost node, has no parent). All other nodes in the tree have <code>parent!=null</code>.</p>

<p>The starting point for a Tree is the root Node. The following code creates the topmost 3 Nodes from your picture (where the type <code>Node</code> is the java class above):</p>

<pre><code>Node nodeRoot = new Node(null, ""root""); //create a node with parent=null
Node nodeA = new Node(nodeRoot, ""A"");
Node nodeB = new Node(nodeRoot, ""B"");
nodeRoot.children.add(nodeA); //you could also place this functionality
nodeRoot.children.add(nodeB); // in the constructor of Node
</code></pre>

<p>You now have 3 a tree (starting at <code>nodeRoot</code>) with 3 nodes: ""root"", ""A"" and ""B"".</p>

<p>You could now show all nodes that are direct children of the root node:</p>

<pre><code>for(Node child:nodeRoot.children){
   System.out.println(child.value);
}
/* prints:
A
B
*/
</code></pre>

<p>Or print the value of a parent's node:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println(nodeA.parent.value);
/*prints:
root
*/
</code></pre>

<p>Try to complete the code to create a tree that represents the one in your picture!</p>

<p>To continue (-> tree traversal), I would strongly advise you to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">read something about it</a> first. Focus on Depth-First-Traversal and Breadth-First-Traversal and make sure you understand the difference.</p>

<hr>

<p>Regarding ""Non-Binary Trees"":
This does work very well for non-binary trees. The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">definition of Binary Trees</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since I used a List of Nodes in the java class above, you can use any number of children per node. In fact, you would have to invest extra work to make the class compliant to a binary tree - which means making sure that each node can only have 0, 1 or 2 children.</p>

<p>For non-binary trees you can a) use the class above and b) apply the same algorithms (BFS/DFS).</p>

<p>I need to implement a drop down menu like the one in the image. I know how to accomplish something like this when there is no 'go' button but how would I do this with the the 'go' button? Is there a way to allow the user to select a link but not trigger it unless the user clicks the go button? Is there a jquery plugin or something for this kind of behavior?</p>

<p>Im not very good with JS, so sample snippets to illustrate your suggestions will go a long way to helping me understand - thanks!</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

  $(""#menu a"").click(function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
  });  

});
</code></pre>

<p>So the user won't be redirected when choosing the link, but won't break that behavior in case he wants to open it in a new tab/window, which is cool.</p>

<p>And for redirecting the user when he clicks, you can just attach an event to the GO button which finds the selected a, takes its href, and set the current location to it's value.</p>

<li>When the user adds a new Alarm, what's the best way to store it?  Using a simple plist?  Using Core Data? </li>
<li>If you look at the Alarm tab in the Clock app, you'll notice it only shows one table cell for each Alarm that exists.  How can I achieve this same appearance?  The default table view fills the whole screen with empty table cells, which I think is ugly.</li>

"3419270","<p>I am trying to program an application for the mac to query a high performance computing cluster about its running and queued calculation jobs.

<p>On the GUI side I would like to be able to display an <code>NSTableView</code> showing all submitted job and alternatively a second option to see all hosts in the cluster, how many and which jobs are running on each node.</p>

<p>The model objects themselves are not so hard to do, what bothers me most is the lifecycle and the ownership relations between the host and the job objects. This has to be well designed otherwise I will run into memory management problems.</p>

<p><strong>Please note that I would like to program it without using CoreData if possible.</strong></p>

<p><img src=""https://www.gorillapatch.com/img/model-draft.png"" alt=""DataModel""></p>

<p><strong>1. Possibility</strong><br>
The yellow queue object is the root object of my object graph and it owns all the host objects (has an <code>NSArray</code> of custom host objects). Each host object owns all the job object which are running on this host (also by having an <code>NSArray</code> of custom job objects). I think that there are two major problems with this approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>where are all the job objects store which are still queued and are not already running on a host. They lack a parent host object.</li>
<li>How would one implement a <code>NSTableView</code> containing all the job objects?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>2. Possibility</strong><br>
The yellow root object holds directly references to all job objects by having them stored in a <code>NSArray</code>. Each job has an instance variable retaining a host object. Again here are some problems</p>

<ol>
<li>I would also have the hosts in the model which are currently idle, so no job is currently executed on them.</li>
<li>How would one implement the data source for a <code>NSTableView</code> showing all the hosts.</li>
<li>How does one make sure that there are no duplicate host objects, so that each host in the cluster is represented by one host object only.</li>
</ol>

<p>My questions are:
1. Which of the two possibilities make most sense? Are there alternatives?
2. Would one better implement it with CoreData?
3. How would one manage the object lifecycle so that there are no retain cycles or dangling pointers.</p>

It's much more efficient memory wise and it manages memory for you in the vast majority of cases. </p>

<p>In general you manage memory by making sure that each individual class' instances clean up after themselves. Then you put the objects in a hierarchy such that as each level deallocates it automatically cleans up the objects under it.</p>

<p>As to the specific structure, it depends on the logic of the situation you are modeling. If the organization logically goes:</p>

<pre><code> queue{
    jobs{
        host
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>... then you should mimic that in your data structure. </p>

<p>I strongly recommend you use Core Data. You will end up duplicating a lot Core Data functionality anyway if you implement this all by hand. Core Data was designed specifically to manage object graphs like this. That is its primary role. All the database stuff was tacked on as an after thought. There's no need to reinvent the wheel. </p>

<p>So it seems that everyone is recommending that I use a table for (duh) tabular data.

<p>The vendor claims that the reason columns are having issues with a resize is because of tables.  They will be moving to a DIV based layout to fix the issue.  I'll post a reference link shortly...</p>

<p>Search for the word ""Based"" and you will see the posting from a MVP who mentions the internal changes:

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps a large non-table based grid will also render faster.</p>

<p>You might say I need a lot of scalibility (for a large rowset) and the ability to resize the panes.  Very similar to how Outlook currently looks/operates:</p>

<p>Summary of needs:
I'm looking for a Table approach that allows for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fast Rendering</li>
<li>Large Datasets</li>
<li>Rich formatting</li>
<li>The ability to resize outer container/div</li>
<li>When changing the width/height of outer container, the columns will keep the width property or grow, as defined in HTML </li>
</ul>

<p>I have not found any way how to stack 3D pie charts. Stacking seems to me available only with Stacked Bar, 100% Stacked Bar, Stacked Column, and 100% Stacked Column.</p>

<p>This is example from ASP.NET Chart Control examples gallery, but this one is without any code behind ...</p>

<p>The only way how to at least get closer to this I've found is to create two series of data, each in its own chart area, but it's creating duplicated legend entries and with collectind small pie slices it changes color data entries. (Like that Ownership, Renting and Leasing labels are duplicated and with differenc colors)</p>

"3423175","<p>I have a bit of a problem that I have just found, after I thought this project had finished. It worked perfectly on my local server but when I pushed the code live the images can take half a second to load properly causing a little page thumbnail to pop up over a loading image. grrr</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/deD1D.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/deD1D.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>So whats happening? Well first off a function runs on <code>window.load</code> which created a large number of list items with a loading gif as the bg image.</p>

<p>Then this function pops an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag into the first list item, with an <code>onload</code> which calls a second function</p>

<p>This second function cycles through an XML file and wraps the URL in the xml in an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and puts it in the next empty <code>LI</code>. this is where the problem lies. At the moment it puts the <code>&lt;img src=$variable onload=loadnextimage() /&gt;</code> into the List item before it has actually loaded.</p>

<p>My code:</p>

<pre><code>$(window).load(function() {
            txt="""";
            for(d=0;d&lt;100;d++)
            {
                txt=txt + ""&lt;li class='gif' id='loading""+d+""'&gt;&lt;/li&gt;""; 

            }
            document.getElementById('page-wrap').innerHTML=txt;
            document.getElementById('loading0').innerHTML=""&lt;img src='images/0.jpg' onLoad='loadImages(0)' /&gt;"";
        });
        function loadImages(i){ 
            i++
            $.ajax
            ({
                type: ""GET"",
                url: ""sites.xml"",
                dataType: ""xml"",
                async: ""true"",
                success: function(xml) 
                {
                    var img = $(xml).find('image[id=' + i + ']'),
                    id = img.attr('id'),
                    url = img.find('url').text();
                    $('#loading'+i).html('&lt;img src=""'+url+'"" onLoad=""loadImages('+i+')"" /&gt;').hide();
                    $('#loading'+i).fadeIn();
                }
            });
        }
</code></pre>

<p>I have a feeling it may be quite tricky achieving this how I have it set up, and I have a feeling i may need to create an img object and wait for that to load???</p>

<p>Once the page is cached the loading obviously works fine but its a bit of a pain ont he first load so i need to fix this.
any advise welcome :) thanks</p>

<p>Hello.  I'm diving into iOS development and am building my own alarm app to become familiar with the SDK.  My questions are...</p>

<ol>
<li>I've played around with UITableViews a bit, but I don't understand how I would implement the table at the top half of this form.  If I had to guess, I would say it's a single UITableView, defined with one section and four rows, is that right?  </li>
<li>If so, to implement it, would I just ""hardcode"" the <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> function to create each cell manually?  </li>
<li>If not, is there an adopted approach to defining the layout and functionality of these types of settings pages?</li>
<li>Row #3 has a switch in it, is this a predefined cell style or a custom cell style that I have to define myself?</li>
<li>Rows #1, 2, and 4 take the user to new views when they're touched.  Is this a predefined style and or do I just implement the standard <code>didSelectRowAtIndexPath</code> functionality to push a new view onto the stack?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks so much in advance for your help!  I'm going to continue researching these questions right now.</p>

"3426091","<p>I'm trying to specify custom Y axis tick marks, but IDL is not cooperating. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ECZaY.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>In the top left, 1.0000 should be the max value, but IDL puts a 57 there. 57 is the max array dimension of my data. </p>

<p>I have an array of eta levels(strings) corresponding 1:1 with the array indices, and I want to use them as tick marks. I've got a bit of code that let's it plot X major tick marks, but IDL keeps throwing that silly max array index value in there instead of my desired final tick mark.</p>

<p>Is there a way I can get rid of that?</p>

<p>As requested, here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>;Get the total number of possible y axis values( this case has 58 )
number_of_ticks = (size( custom_levels[ min_level:max_level ] ) )[1]

;I want 6 major tick marks
number_of_major_ticks = 6

;The amount in between each tick in terms of array index
tick_step = number_of_ticks / number_of_major_ticks

;Check if we can fit another tick mark in
if ((((number_of_major_ticks - 1)+min_level) * tick_step) + tick_step) LT number_of_ticks then begin
   number_of_major_ticks = number_of_major_ticks + 1
endif

;Get the array positions of the values that will be used for tick marks
tick_array_indices = indgen( number_of_major_ticks )    
tick_array_indices = (tick_array_indices+min_level) * tick_step

;Now build the array of tick mark strings that should be displayed
y_tick_labels = strarr( number_of_major_ticks + 1 )

for i = 0, number_of_major_ticks - 1 do begin
   y_tick_labels[i] = custom_levels[ tick_array_indices[ i ] ]
endfor

;That's all the initial setup, now to actually plot the data:

<p>IDL seems to require that you specify a number of tick marks 1 less than the labels you give it.</p>

<p>So if you want 11 tick marks, and have 11 labels for your tick marks, set the number of major tick marks to 10.</p>

"3427253","<p>On the demo website for jqGrid, the columnChooser module is displayed like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i725.photobucket.com/albums/ww255/JayD3e2010/jqGrid_columnChooser.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>It allows you to both reorder the columns and select which columns are to be shown.</p>

<p>Unfortunately when I enter this section of code into my application(The code that is suppose to make this appear exactly as portrayed):</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(""#colch"").jqGrid('navButtonAdd','#pcolch',
                        { caption: ""Columns"",
                          title: ""Reorder Columns"",
                          onClickButton : function (){
                              jQuery(""#colch"").jqGrid('columnChooser');
                          } 
                        // ...
</code></pre>

<p>It displays a column chooser; however, it only allows you to choose which columns to display and not the order the appear.  One other noticeable difference is that the interface looks nothing like the above, it is simply a list of columns that you either select or de-select, by control click to select them one at a time or shift-click to select in bulk.</p>

<p>Here is a link to the demo site, to use as a reference.

<pre><code>ul#menu &gt; li {
  display: block;
  float: left;
  background: url(img/menuitem.png) top left;
  width: 104px;                                 /* here's the issue */

  text-align: center;
  position: relative;                           /* add this */
}

<p>Since it has a <code>width</code> specified, and its child is in the normal flow, its child is obeying <em>its</em> width, rather than scaling by itself.  What you can do is take the child out of the flow, by adding <code>position: realtive;</code> like I have in the above style, then give the child <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> a <code>position: absolute</code>, like this:</p>

<pre><code>ul#menu &gt; li ul {
  position: absolute;
  top: 36px;              /* top &lt;li&gt; is 36px, go down that much */
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then finally, so the anchor text gets a full background, give it a <code>white-space</code> rule like this:</p>

<pre><code>ul#menu &gt; li &gt; a, ul#menu &gt; li &gt; ul a {
  display: block;

","Histogram with numeric x-axis in gnuplot?","<gnuplot><histogram><numeric>","2010-08-07 12:35:19","15684","3432416","2","<p>Ok, after reading the <code>gnuplot</code> help for a bit, it seems that histogram style will ''always'' interpret x axis as sequential entries/categories - so indeed, there seems to be no way to get a numerical axis with a histogram style. </p>

<p>However, it turns out that <code>$</code> can refer to a column, and those can be used to actually 'reposition' the bars in the second (<code>frequency with boxes</code> style) example; so with this code as <code>hist-v2b.gplot</code>: </p>

<pre><code>set xlabel ""X values""
set ylabel ""Occurence""
set style fill solid border -1
set term png
set output 'hist-v2.png'
set boxwidth 0.9
set xr [330:400]
# here, setting xtics makes them positioned numerically on x axis:
set xtics (""332"" 332, ""336"" 336, ""340"" 340, ""394"" 394, ""398"" 398, ""1036"" 1036)  
# 1:2 will ONLY work with proper xr; since we have x&gt;300; xr[0:10] generates ""points y value undefined""!

"3430629","<p>I noticed the WinForms RichTextBox has a <code>ZoomFactor</code> property that I assume is exactly what I want--unfortunately this seems to be entirely missing on the WPF variant.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can achieve the same functionality (increasing/decreasing the visible text size of the whole document without actually changing the underlying RTF)?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> While setting a LayoutTransform on the RichTextBox does seem to work under very simple settings, it's not exactly the same as setting ZoomFactor because of a couple things:</p>

<ul>
<li>First, the scroll bar is zoomed also. This just looks silly.</li>
<li>Second, in my app (for some reason, but not in Kaxaml--I'll explore this to figure out why), the text is <em>bitmap zoomed</em> so that it just enlarges the rendered text as opposed to vector-zooming it so it's smooth. Here's an example of what I'm talking about (note the way-big custom scroll bar):</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/BUy7Q.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/BUy7Q.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> Okay I discovered that the bitmap zooming was being caused by setting TextOptions.TextFormattingMode to <code>Display</code> instead of <code>Ideal</code>. Setting it to ideal reintroduces vector zooming.</p>

<p>However there is still that pesky scroll bar! I mean one option is to disable scrolling on the RichTextBox and wrap it in a ScrollViewer, but I wonder if that would deteriorate performance. I also wonder if text wrapping would still work if I did that.</p>

"3431190","<p>I've got two classes in my MVC project <code>Order</code> and <code>Product</code>.</p>

<p>Because <code>Product</code> can be ordered many times and <code>Order</code> can have many products I've got third entity which is <code>OrderedProduct</code>. It joins those two entities in many-to-many relation.</p>

<p>Now what I'm trying to do is to let user to make an order by putting products from the drop down list to the box and then to save my order. Also client have to fill some fileds in the Order entity such as Address data etc. All I want is to have it all on one single page. User can add as many items from dropdown as he like, then he can add whole order.</p>

<p>To make it easier to visualize look at this picture:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/p2FoR.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/p2FoR.png"" alt=""Layout""></a>
</p>

<p>Now the problem is how to implement such behaviour in my MVC app. Should I build a ViewModel that combines <code>Order</code> class and list of <code>Product</code> or use partial view for <code>Product</code> classes?</p>

<p>Also which is my <strong>main problem</strong>, how can I (in elegant way) retrieve the full list of chosen products or at least product id's in the controller after POST request? In this case how can I specify that what I'm sending is a collection of ids? It's simple to add one object, but what about whole collection?</p>

I'm going to assume <code>OrderedProduct</code> is an object for ordering that contains a Product ID and a quantity <em>and</em> that you want to be able to modify them all at the same time.</p>

<p>Make <code>Order</code> your ViewModel. Given that it has a <code>List&lt;OrderedProduct&gt;</code> property called <code>OrderedProducts</code>:<br>
Create a small editor control with a ViewModel of <code>OrderedProduct</code>. No form, just a textbox/dropdown/whatever bound to the product name property and a textbox bound to the product quantity. <strong>Important</strong>: put this control in views/shared/EditorTemplates and call it OrderedProduct.ascx.</p>

<p>Give your <code>Order</code> object a property called <code>NewOrderedProduct</code> of type <code>OrderedProduct</code>.
In the form for the <code>Order</code> view do: <code>&lt;%=Html.EditorFor(m=&gt;m.OrderedProducts)%&gt;</code> this will give you an editable list current items in the order.<br>
After that do: <code>&lt;%= Html.EditorFor(m=&gt; m.NewOrderedProduct) %&gt;</code> this is where you can add new items.<br>
Have the [POST] action take a type of <code>Order</code>.  </p>

<p>Now when it submits if the <code>NewOrderedProduct</code> property is valid you can add it to the <code>OrderedProducts</code> list and redisplay. You can add as many as you want this way and they will all autobind.</p>

<p>Have a separate submit button in the form for submitting the order. Check for the existence of that button's name in the [POST] and submit all at one time. </p>

<p>This gets you a straight HTML working version. From there you can Ajaxify it if you want. </p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong><br>
Updated to reflect the function of the <code>OrderedProduct</code> object and correct the type the post accepts</p>

"3433360","<p>I'm trying to submit an update of an existing application on behalf of one of my clients, and I'm getting ""Invalid Binary"" failures from iTunes Connect with no explanation of the error.  I'm leaving on a 2 week vacation without network access tomorrow, so I'm a bit desperate for a solution.  Any insights are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>This update changes the name of the application and fixes a few minor bugs.  I did previous submissions via the iTunes Connect, but I'm submitting this update via Xcode as Apple now requires.</p>

<p>I set myself up as the technical contact for this client, so I receive a notification when I put the new version into a ""Waiting for Upload"" state via iTunes Connect.  When I then validate the binary via the Xcode organizer, the tool eventually reports that the binary is valid.  When I submit the binary via the Xcode organizer, it eventually comes back and says that the binary has been successfully uploaded.  Both of these steps take a while (maybe 15 minutes each), probably because the app bundle is 63 megabytes with thousands of resources.</p>

<p>For the next hour or two the iTunes Connect portal still reports that the application is in a ""Waiting for Upload"" state.  I believe some latency is normal between the time when the upload completes in Xcode and when the state changes in iTunes Connect.  These hours of latency seem excessive, but not entirely surprising I suppose, given the size of the app.</p>

<p>Eventually the state just silently changes to ""Invalid Binary"" in iTunes connect.  I understand that iTunes Connect is supposed to send out an email explaining the error when this happens, but I'm not receiving anything, nor is my client.  (I assume it should go out to all users flagged for notification of app state changes in iTunes Connect.  Is this assumption correct?)</p>

<p>Any insights are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT - Apparent status change latency explained</strong></p>

<p>Based on my status history, it appears that the ""Invalid Binary"" status is actually being established within minutes, but iTunes Connect is concealing this fact with a poorly designed caching strategy.  </p>

<p>To monitor for a change in state, I've been refreshing and clicking around between four pages: ""Manage Your Applications"", the ""App Information"" page, ""View Details"", and ""Status History"".  When the status history finally updates, it shows that the app went into an ""Invalid Binary"" state around an hour prior.</p>

<p>As an experiment, I tried changing my app ID and submitting the binary as a new app. This time, I clicked into the ""View Details"" page a few minutes after submitting the binary.  Its status showed, ""Upload Received"".  Apparent progress!  A couple minutes later I clicked into Status History, and it showed ""Invalid Binary"" mere minutes after my upload finished.  Then I went back and refreshed my ""View Details"" page.  It still shows ""Upload Received"", despite the fact that the Status History shows ""Invalid Binary"".  This is pretty clear evidence that all these pages are being cached and showing stale data for long periods of time.  I only caught this when I resubmitted the binary as a new app because I was loading the pages for that app for the first time.</p>

<p>This doesn't solve my ""Invalid Binary"" problem, nor does it explain why I'm not getting any emails, but it does help rule out some hypotheses.</p>

<p>The format of the Entitlements.plist changed between SDK 3.1.3 and 3.2.  If your Entitlements.plist was created with an SDK earlier than 3.2, and you're now trying to update your app using SDK 3.2 or greater, it appears that you have to delete the Entitlements.plist and re-add it using the new format.

"3434250","<p>I am having some trouble with the flex Tree control.
I have a control in my system and of course it is data driven.</p>

<p>I have a group which shows a folder icon and that's fine but it also shows an expand icon when the item has no children.</p>

<p>I don't what it to show the expand icon when the group has no children but I do want to show the folder icon, because it is different entities in my system.</p>

<p>here's an example of what I'm talking about. I still want to show the folder icon, the expand Icon should be hidden in this case only for the child icon.</p>

<p><img src=""https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4114/4871102935_daed6e6722.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>
","flex expand and collapse icon in Tree control","<apache-flex><actionscript-3><flex3>","2010-08-08 12:14:29","2696","3434439","1","<p>It's easy to get this problem if you're trying to use a non-XML data provider (e.g. setting the dataProvider property of the Tree to a structure of nested ArrayCollections). In that case, the trick is to give each node a <code>children()</code> function that returns <code>null</code> (as opposed to an empty set) if there are no children.</p>

<p>However, assuming you're using a plain old XMLListCollection, what are you doing to make it display a folder icon at all? If you're giving the node an empty set of children, then once again, the expand icon will be displayed. The list of child nodes must be <code>null</code>. Alternatively, if you set the <code>isBranch</code> property of the node to true, it will display 'incorrectly' as you have it above.</p>

<p>The easiest way to display a folder icon without the expand icons is to just replace all the (really rather ugly) default icons with your own, which gives you complete control of how they appear. What you would do is set three properties: <code>defaultLeafIcon</code>, <code>folderClosedIcon</code>, and <code>folderOpenIcon</code> (<a href=""http://blog.flexexamples.com/2007/11/14/customizing-folder-and-leaf-icons-in-the-flex-tree-control-using-the-folderopenicon-folderclosedicon-and-defaultleaficon-styles/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">good example at Flex Examples</a>):</p>

public var iconFolderOpen:Class;

&lt;mx:Tree dataProvider=""{yourData}""
    defaultLeafIcon=""{iconFolder}""
    folderClosedIcon=""{iconFolder}""
    folderOpenIcon=""{iconFolderOpen}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I see you're already using the Silk icon set, which has a rather nice closed folder icon. For some reason it doesn't contain an open folder icon though, but you can just use a closed one or anything else.</p>

<p>You could also just use an iconFunction (<a href=""http://blog.flexexamples.com/2007/11/15/creating-a-custom-icon-function-on-a-flex-tree-control/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Flex Examples again</a>), though I think the approach above is easier for what you're trying to achieve.</p>

<p>If it's none of those problems, give us a bit more detail on the content of your data provider and existing tree properties and see if we can't figure it out then. Hope that helps a bit anyway.</p>

"3434902","<p>I'm working on an iPhone app that (among other things) has a detail view for records with lots of attributes and lots of related records.  Rather than having one <em>really</em> long scroll view or table view, I am thinking it might be easiest to break the detail view into several separate views (some UIViews, some UITableViews, etc) that each display one grouping of the record's attributes or related records.</p>

<p>I use a UINavigationController to control view changes in my app, and I could put a UISegmentedController the <code>toolbar</code> to control which group of the record's attributes or relationships to display.  This would look like:</p>

    UIView *firstModeView;

<p>You'd probably store each UIView composition in its own nib, and load them manually with [NSBundle loadNibNamed:owner:options:].</p>

<p>Add IBActions to your view controller to show each view:</p>

    if(currentDetailView != secondModeView) {
        [self.rootView addSubview:secondModeView];

        // alternatively, you could keep all of your detail views
        //     on the root view, and use bringSubviewToFront
        [self.currentDetailView removeFromSuperview];
        self.currentDetailView = secondModeView;

"3437802","<p>I have a web service for a production application that is returning different results to different clients for the same inbound request.</p>

    &lt;b:mVersionNumber&gt;0&lt;/b:mVersionNumber&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>Trouble is, the client isn't picking up on the time zone information included and is therefore showing (for this example) <strong>29 September 2005, 11:00pm</strong> to the user.</p>

<p>I've double checked, and all the machines involved (both clients, application server and web server) are all correctly configured to NZST:</p>

<p><img src=""https://lh5.ggpht.com/_afoGSadSspw/TF-dDd3IV6I/AAAAAAAAEKY/i0VnwtCq8PE/s800/NZST.png""/></p>

<p>Tracing through the WCF messages between client and server, the only other differences I've seen are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>&lt;TimeCreated&gt;</code> - when the message was created</li>
<li><code>&lt;Execution&gt;</code> - the source process</li>
<li><code>&lt;Computer&gt;</code> - name of the client computer</li>
<li><code>&lt;MessageLogTraceRecord&gt;</code> - WCF Message timestamp?</li>
<li><code>&lt;MessageID&gt;</code> - GUID for the message</li>
</ul>

<p>These five elements are different on each message - otherwise the message streams are identical, except for the date/times coming through as noted above.</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<ul>
<li>Both tests run against the same application server (and, therefore, the same database)</li>
<li>The same request is being made by both client PCs</li>
<li>The response to the request has <em>some</em> (around 20%) observations targeted at the wrong time zone</li>
<li>All the machines are configured to timezone +1200 (NZST).</li>
</ul>

<p>I figure that there must be a patch or something different between the machines, but after 8 hours of searching, I've yet to find it. Thanks for your time.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does the ""wrong"" client consistently get the wrong value for the same entry, or does it vary between calls? Does it always happen the same way round? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each client is quite consistent from call to call. </p>

<p>The sequence of web service calls results in 26784 distinct time series observations. Both clients get the same number of results, but differ in the time stamps associated with the values. For one client, all 26784 values are midnight aligned; for the other, 5630 of the values (21%) are offset 1 hour earlier than they should be. Not all examples of a specific date/time will be offset: for example, of 992 records that should have timestamp 31/3/2010, 448 instead have 30/3/2010 11pm,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the requests are absolutely identical, it I can't see how it can really be explained by any difference at the client side.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm wondering if there is any ""out of band"" communication not shown in the WCF message tracing. Wild speculation: we're using ""WindowsAuthenticationBasicHttpBinding"", so I was wondering if WCF queried AD for locale information or something. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Also, why are the clients ignoring the time zone </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We're not knowingly ignoring the time zone, it just seems to be happening. We have DTOs with DateTime properties being serialized across the wire from the server to the client and then reassembled. For convenience, we're sharing the same DTO assembly both server and client side, so I'd (perhaps naiively) expect the Date Time to round trip intact.</p>

","HowTo combine QAbstractTableModel and QItemDelegate to one working source?","<qt><qt4><qitemdelegate><qabstractitemmodel>","2010-08-09 08:08:13","8114","3478390","2","<p>From the overview of <a href=""http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.6/qabstractitemmodel.html#details"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">QAbstractItemModel</a> (see the <strong>Subclassing</strong> heading):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To enable editing in your model, you

<p>The same information is given in the overview of <a href=""http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.6/qabstracttablemodel.html#details"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">QAbstractTableModel</a>.  Your <code>PortfolioModel</code> class does not reimplement either of these functions.  In order to use the delegate's editor, you need to use do so.</p>

<p>Alternately, you may only want it to appear as if a combobox is there (not actually allow editing).  If that is the case, you will probably need to do some drawing hacks yourself to make it appear that way... or mark it as editable but disable the widget, or something like that.</p>

"3439344","<p>For a strange reason I cannot find the way to specify spines configuration in Python's matplotlibrc file. Any idea on how to cause matplotlib not to draw upper and right spines by default?

<p>Thank you</p>
","Setting spines in matplotlibrc","<python><matplotlib>","2010-08-09 11:00:15","6852","3509553","3","<p>In order to hide the right and top spines of a subplot, you need to both set the colour of the relevant spines to <code>'none'</code>, as well as set the tick position to <code>'left'</code> for the xtick, and <code>'bottom'</code> for the ytick (in order to hide the tick marks as well as the spines).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, none of these are currently accessible via <code>matplotlibrc</code>. The parameters specified in <code>matplotlibrc</code> are validated, and then stored in a dict called <code>rcParams</code>. It is then up to the individual modules to check for a key in this dict whose value will act as their default. If they don't check it for one of their options, that option is not alterable via the <code>rc</code> file. </p>

<p>Due to the nature of the <code>rc</code> system, and the way that spines are written, altering the code to allow for this would not be straightforward:</p>

<p>Spines currently obtain their colour through the same <code>rc</code> parameter used to define axis colours; you cannot set it to <code>'none'</code> without hiding all of your axis drawing. They are also agnostic towards whether they are <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>left</code>, or <code>bottom</code> &mdash; these are really just four separate spines stored in a dict. The individual spine objects do not know what side of the plot they compose, so you cannot just add new <code>rc</code> params and assign the proper one during spine initialization.</p>

<pre><code>self.set_edgecolor( rcParams['axes.edgecolor'] )
</code></pre>

<p>(<em>./matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/spines.py</em>, __init__(), <em>line 54</em>)</p>

<p>If you have a large amount of existing code, such that adding the axis parameters manually to each one would be too burdensome, you could alternately use a helper function to iterate through all of the Axis objects and set the values for you.</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from matplotlib.pyplot import show

# Set up a default, sample figure. 
fig = plt.figure()
x = np.linspace(-np.pi,np.pi,100)
y = 2*np.sin(x)

ax = fig.add_subplot(1,2,2)
ax.plot(x,y)
ax.set_title('Normal Spines')

def hide_spines():
    """"""Hides the top and rightmost axis spines from view for all active
    figures and their respective axes.""""""

    # Retrieve a list of all current figures.
    figures = [x for x in matplotlib._pylab_helpers.Gcf.get_all_fig_managers()]
    for figure in figures:
        # Get all Axis instances related to the figure.
        for ax in figure.canvas.figure.get_axes():
            # Disable spines.
            ax.spines['right'].set_color('none')
            ax.spines['top'].set_color('none')
            # Disable ticks.
            ax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('bottom')
            ax.yaxis.set_ticks_position('left')

hide_spines()
show()
</code></pre>

<p>Just call <code>hide_spines()</code> before <code>show()</code>, and it will hide them in all of the figures that <code>show()</code> displays. I cannot think of a simpler way to alter a large number of figures, outside of spending the time to patch <code>matplotlib</code> and add in <code>rc</code> support for the needed options.  </p>

<li><p>Then, get rid of the tableview CCK field. You won't need it as the view you're going to create will do what you're looking to do.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now, go to <em>Site Building</em> -&gt; <em>Views</em> --&gt; <em>Add</em>. Enter in a name for the view; let's say <em>listing</em>. You can change the <em>Description</em> and <em>Tags</em> to whatever you want, but leave the <em>View type</em> set to <em>Node</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Now, set up the view. Under <em>Fields</em>, add the fields you want to show up in your product table; let's say the <em>Node: Title</em> and the <em>Node: Body</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under <em>Filters</em>, add a filter for <em>Node: Type</em> so the view will only show products and not other types of nodes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under <em>Basic Settings</em>, change the <em>Style</em> from <em>Unformatted</em> to <em>Table</em>.</p>
<p>You'll now have a view that'll display every product available in a table. The next stage of this is to limit that table to only display products that a particular node references. To do that, you'll create an argument.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Under <em>Arguments</em>, add <em>Node: ID</em>. The view will now display only nodes with IDs that match the argument passed to the view.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Check <em>Allow multiple terms per argument</em>, which will let you look up more than one node at a time.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since you won't be passing those arguments manually, you'll have the view automatically generate the arguments its looking for. Select <em>Provide default argument</em> under <em>Action to take if argument is not present</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few options available, but none match the one you want: that is, the node IDs for the nodes referenced. So, choose <em>PHP Code</em> so you can supply a custom argument. Use the following code:</p>
<pre><code>$arguments = array();
$node = node_load(arg(1));

if ($node-&gt;field_product) {
  foreach ($node-&gt;field_product as $product) {
    if ($product['nid']) $arguments[] = $product['nid'];
  }
}

return implode(',', $arguments);
</code></pre>
<p>This will look for the page's node ID (<code>arg(1)</code>), check to see if it has the product node reference field (<code>$node-&gt;field_product</code>, change <code>field_product</code> to the short name of your field), then build an argument containing the ID of each node referenced. It returns the argument list in the format that Views expects: <code>1,2,3</code>.</p>
<p>Now the view is complete: the only thing left to do is make the view appear on the page. You can create a <em>Block</em> display, then add that block to a region under <em>Site building</em> -&gt; <em>Blocks</em>. If you go to a page that references products, the block will appear with the table of referenced blocks.</p>
<p>If you want the view to be a part of the node itself, look into the <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/viewreference"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">View Reference</a> module, which creates a CCK field that references a view much like Node Reference references a node.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/YjEdN.jpg"" alt=""WireShark Screenshot""></p>

<p>This is from a Curl call to the same web address with the same details. The issue is that under my VB.NET version the ""Extension: server_name"" (and related) part of the SSL packet is missing, I believe that this is causing the server to not reply with the Server key exchange in the next couple packets.</p>

<p>Below is the VB.NET code</p>

<pre><code>    Dim webRequest As HttpWebRequest = DirectCast(System.Net.WebRequest.Create(UrlString), HttpWebRequest)
    webRequest.Method = ""GET""
    webRequest.ContentType = ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded""

    webRequest.Credentials = New NetworkCredential(username, password)

    Dim response As HttpWebResponse = DirectCast(webRequest.GetResponse(), HttpWebResponse)
</code></pre>

<p>This fails on the last line (HTTP 401 error), issue does not seem to be related to my proxy and the user credentials are correct for the server as this request works from Curl and wget.</p>

"3445349","<p>I've been struggling with a strange problem which has arisen in using the CorePlot framework, but which I suspect isn't an error in the framework itself.  I'm hoping somebody here will have seen something similar, and can point me in a productive direction.</p>

<p>I have a tabbed view in which graphs are shown.  The tab that is initially active has no problems at all, but often when I open the next tab, I see the following:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Udr7r.png"" alt=""http://imgur.com/J0VDs.png""></p>

<p>Note that on the top graph, several labels are missing.  If I switch back to the original tab, then to the second tab again, all is well every time.  I've placed various diagnostic logging statements in and have determined that:</p>

<ol>
<li>The view is awake before the graph is created; and</li>
<li>The drawInContext: method of each label is being called, including those that are missing.  In fact, the axis labels are amongst the last things rendered, so I'd expect them to show if anything does, and some of the labels that are missing are being rendered after (and before) those that are present.</li>
</ol>

<p>Because the rendering seems to be going ahead as it should, and because this thing draws fine ""the second time around"", I suspect that the problem is in how I'm hooking this up to the views, or in my timing there, and not in Core Plot itself (or, for example, in clipping).  I'm out of ideas on how to debug this, though, and would love to hear from anybody who has experience with a similar problem.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"3446727","<p>How does Linux determine the next PID it will use for a process?  The purpose of this question is to better understand the Linux kernel.  Don't be afraid to post kernel source code.  If PIDs are allocated sequentially how does Linux fill in the gaps?  What happens when it hits the end?</p>

<p>For example if I run a PHP script from Apache that does a <code>&lt;?php print(getmypid());?&gt;</code> the same PID will be printed out for a few minutes while hit refresh.  This period of time is a function of how many requests apache is receiving. Even if there is only one client the PID will eventually change. </p>

<p>When the PID changes, it will be a close number,  but how close? The number does not appear to be entirely sequential. If I do a <code>ps aux | grep apache</code> I get a fair number of processes:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/XYU90.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>How does Linux choose this next number?  The previous few PID's are still running, as well as the most recent PID that was printed.   How does apache choose to reuse these PIDs? </p>
","How does Linux determine the next PID?","<linux><apache><linux-kernel><kernel>","2010-08-10 07:03:26","25154","3457108","4","<p>The kernel allocates PIDs in the range of (RESERVED_PIDS, PID_MAX_DEFAULT). It does so sequentially in each namespace (tasks in different namespaces can have the same IDs). In case the range is exhausted, pid assignment wraps around.</p>
<p>Some relevant code:</p>
<h1>Inside alloc_pid(...)</h1>
<pre><code>for (i = ns-&gt;level; i &gt;= 0; i--) {
    nr = alloc_pidmap(tmp);
    if (nr &lt; 0)
        goto out_free;
    pid-&gt;numbers[i].nr = nr;
    pid-&gt;numbers[i].ns = tmp;
    tmp = tmp-&gt;parent;
}
</code></pre>
<h1>alloc_pidmap()</h1>
<pre><code>static int alloc_pidmap(struct pid_namespace *pid_ns)
{
        int i, offset, max_scan, pid, last = pid_ns-&gt;last_pid;
        struct pidmap *map;

        pid = last + 1;
        if (pid &gt;= pid_max)
                pid = RESERVED_PIDS;
        /* and later on... */
        pid_ns-&gt;last_pid = pid;
        return pid;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Do note that PIDs in the context of the kernel are more than just <code>int</code> identifiers; the relevant structure can be found in <code>/include/linux/pid.h</code>. Besides the id, it contains a list of tasks with that id, a reference counter and a hashed list node for fast access.</p>
<p>The reason for PIDs not appearing sequential in user space is because kernel scheduling might fork a process in between your process' <code>fork()</code> calls. It's very common, in fact.</p>

<p>My only ""solution"" has been to try to educate the users with a help button which has a snapshot of the dialog telling them what to do with it.  Not ideal.</p>

<p>Anyway, it's a rant + question, so any help would be appreciated.</p>

"3457107","<p>I am looking for a WPF control which is a hybrid of TreeView and DataGrid, something like the Visual Studio debugger or QuickBooks contacts list etc.</p>

<p>Any other solution on how to handle editable hierarchical data in WPF will be very welcommed as well.</p>

","Handle editable hierarchical data / TreeView~DataGrid hybrid","<wpf><datagrid><controls><treeview><wpf-controls>","2010-08-11 09:40:09","20707","5444154","5","<p>This seems to me like a reasonably straightforward thing to implement if you design your view model properly.</p>

<p>You basically design the items the same way you would if displaying them in a normal data grid, i.e. each item has a property for each column.  In all likelihood, your underlying data model is hierarchical, but the collection that the grid is bound to is going to be flattened, i.e. will contain an item for each node in the hierarchy irrespective of parent/child relationships.</p>

<p>The item view model has some additional properties:  <code>Level</code>, <code>Children</code>, <code>IsExpanded</code>, and <code>IsVisible</code>.  <code>Level</code> is a count of the node's ancestors, <code>Children</code> contains the child view model nodes, <code>IsExpanded</code> is used in the UI, and <code>IsVisible</code> is true if the node is visible.  It also implements a property called <code>VisibleDescendants</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;NodeViewModel&gt; VisibleDescendants
{
   get
   {
      return Children
             .Where(x =&gt; x.IsVisible)
             .SelectMany(x =&gt; (new[] {x}).Concat(x.VisibleDescendants)));
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You use <code>Level</code>, <code>HasChildren</code>, and <code>IsExpanded</code> in the style for the item in the control's first column:  they control the left margin and what kind of icon (if any) is displayed.</p>

<p>You also need to implement <code>ExpandCommand</code> and <code>CollapseCommand</code> properties.  The <code>ExpandCommand</code> is enabled if <code>Children.Any()</code> is true and <code>IsExpanded</code> is false, and the <code>CollapseCommand</code> is enabled if <code>Children.Any()</code> is true and <code>IsExpanded</code> is true.  These commands, when executed, change the value of <code>IsExpanded</code>.</p>

<p>And here's where it gets interesting.  The simple way to implement this may work for you:  the items are exposed by a parent view model whose <code>Items</code> property is not a collection.  Instead, it's an enumerator that travels down the chain of child view models and yields only the visible nodes:</p>

<pre><code>public IEnumerable&lt;NodeViewModel&gt; Items
{
   get
   {
      return _Items
             .Where(x =&gt; x.IsVisible)
             .SelectMany(x =&gt; (new[] {x}).Concat(x.VisibleDescendants));
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever any descendant's <code>IsVisible</code> property changes, the parent view model raises <code>PropertyChanged</code> for the <code>Items</code> property, which forces the data grid to repopulate.</p>

<p>There's a less simple implementation too, where you make the <code>Items</code> property a class that implements <code>INotifyCollectionChanged</code>, and that raises the proper <code>CollectionChanged</code> events when descendant nodes become visible/invisible, but you only want to go there if performance is an issue.</p>

Then, when you run through each category on the PHP side, look up sub-categories where the Parent_ID = $current_id. In order to get the root categories (uppermost), look up those where the Parent_ID = NULL.</p>

<p>This way you can make a recursive loop on the PHP side.</p>

<p>Here's a rough idea on how you can make a recursive function.</p>

<pre><code>function showCategories($parent_id = 0, $level = 0) {
    // If $parent_id == 0, look up categories with Parent_ID = NULL, otherwise by $parent_id.
    // For each category, show link and run showCategories() with the category's ID as $parent_id.
    // Throw in ++$level as the level, and do --$level at the end of each iteration.
    // Use $level to indicate how deep down the tree you are.
}
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: The Parent_ID field must be NULL-able because otherwise you cannot indicate a top-most category, since the Parent_ID must exist as an ID (assuming you properly link your tables).</p>

<p>In my app's <code>cellForRowAtIndexPath</code> method, I create and attach the <code>UISwitch</code> control like so...</p>

<pre><code> CGRect frameSwitch = CGRectMake(215.0, 10.0, 94.0, 27.0);
 UISwitch *switchEnabled = [[UISwitch alloc] initWithFrame:frameSwitch];

 cell.accessoryView = switchEnabled;

"3464610","<p>I work in the architecture and construction industry, but currently spend a lot of my time doing software development. After moving my software projects into Subversion repositories I've realized how much this industry really needs a similar system for design and construction documents. I've only been developing software for a year and half, so I'm far from qualified to take on a project like this. But I'm still interested in attempting it if nothing else for the learning experience.</p>

<p>I'd like to develop a server client system that runs over HTTP similar to SubVersion, but rather then managing raw files the system would store architectural design information. An open schema specification already exists for this type of data called Industry Foundation Classes. Yet currently information in this format is always stored in individual files, encoded as STEP or XML, and shared over simple FTP servers.</p>

<p>Instead I'd like to develop a way to store this information in a database so that subsets of the data can be easily queried or updated. In addition, I'd like to include versioning functionality similar to subversion where the central database tracks changes to the data as deltas, which can also be branched into multiple options. </p>

<p>I don't want to simply use SVN, because I'd like the system to be aware of the data it contains. For example a user may want to be able to query all the walls from the server. Yet, in order for that to work the server will need to understand that it may contain walls.</p>

<p>Obviously there are a number of specific questions I could ask regarding how I should go about this. But first I'm trying to figure out the big picture of how each layer will work and with what technology.</p>

<p>So far I've only been developing stand alone applications, primarily in C#.Net. So I'm new to any kind of network/server/client type development. Would it make sense to develop an application like this as a .NET Web service hooked into a SQL Server database? So requests to the server would be made through SOAP, and the data would then be returned as XML? SVN does something similar but through WebDAV correct? See the diagram below.</p>

<p><img src=""https://imgur.com/CBYUy.jpg"" alt=""alt text""> </p>

<p>I'm not necessarily stuck on staying in the Microsoft/C#/.NET environment but it seems like the easiest option given that I'm already pretty comfortable with it and Visual Studio and a .NET WebService will automatically create the SOAP functionality. Is there a Java equivalent to a .NET Web service where I can focus on the object model and not the RCP interface? Would there be a significant advantage of using a RCP other then SOAP such as XML-RCP, JSON, or REST? </p>

<p>I'd really like to hear any other feedback from more experienced developers on how they would approach a project like this.</p>

<p>I would recommend looking at it a different way; Could you use git/svn/hg/etc as a content-neutral storage system, and have a complementary system you write that can query it for content and do content-aware operations against it?   This way you don't have to re-solve all the problems and can stand on the work already done and vetted, and tools already written can be used to work with the 'raw' data.</p>

You need to override them with ""stronger"" CSS rules. You can use the !important keyword if you need to.</p>

<pre><code>    .TaskFormField {
      font-size: 10px !important;
    }

    .TaskFormField {
      font-size: 12px; /* One could believe that the font size should be 12px,
                  but it remains 10px because the !important keyword is used. */
    }
</code></pre>
"
"3469481","<p>All the examples I've seen use ""getElementById"" to get the single element, and then change that style for that singular element.</p>

<p>I'm in the situation where I need to modify all the matching elements on the page with a style.  I need to change the font size, height, and width.  How do I do this, and is jQuery required or optional?  The reason I ask is because this site doesn't use jQuery and I'd rather not download the entire library just to accomplish this one thing.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
As an example, suppose I have several elements on the page with this style:</p>

<pre><code>.outerContact
{
    border: 0px;
    margin: 7px;    
    float: left;
   padding: 0px; 
 background: url(/TLSADMIN/UserControls/contactsgrid/trans-shadow.png) no-repeat bottom right; /* Most major browsers other than IE supports transparent shadow. Newer release of IE should be able to support that. */        
}
.contactLarge{
    height: 163px;
    width: 250px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc; 
    border-top: 1px solid #ddd;
    font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, ""Times New Roman"", serif;
    font-size:small;
    margin: -5px 5px 5px -5px; /* Offset the image by certain pixels to reveal the shadow, as the shadows are 6 pixels wide, offset it by that amount to get a perfect shadow */

  /* Most major browsers other than IE supports transparent shadow. Newer release of IE should be able to support that. */     
     background-image: url('/TLSADMIN/UserControls/contactsgrid/OutlookContactGradient.png') ;
     background-repeat:repeat-x;
      background-position: bottom;
padding: 0px; /* Increasing this gives a white border around the image */ 
background-color: #f2f6f9; /* Background color of the border created by the padding */
border: 1px solid #cecece; /* A 1 pixel greyish border is applied to the white border created by the padding */ 
display: block; /* IE won't do well without this */ 
position: relative; /* Make the shadow's position relative to its image */ 

}
</code></pre>

<p>And then assume I have a JavaScript function that will proportionally resize the elements above according to a slider bar.  The slider bar I'm using is available from a 3rd party here: 
<a href=""http://aspnetajax.componentart.com/control-specific/slider/features/custom_Scrollbar/WebForm1.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://aspnetajax.componentart.com/control-specific/slider/features/custom_Scrollbar/WebForm1.aspx</a>  </p>

<p>That slider will then pass a number that I'll use to determine how much to zoom in/out:</p>

<pre><code>function ResizeWindowAccordingToScrollBar(PercentChange)
{
 //Locate elements
 //Resize fonts, borders, all styles to zoom in/ zoom out.

}
</code></pre>

<p>How do you recommend I handle the ""PercentChange"" value?  I may swap out the CSS style for each matching element using a switch statment, but that may not be as smooth as other options could be.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE2</strong></p>

<p>Also, if someone wants to look at my code, a self contained sample is here:

","If I use ""getElementById"" to alter a CSS style of a single object, how do I alter all elements that inherit the style?","<jquery><css><dhtml><getelementbyid>","2010-08-12 15:45:46","1359","3470835","3","<p>So let's say you have some HTML like this...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an example&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Some of this content can be re-sized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src=""lenna.jpg"" class=""iconic"" alt=""a petty lady"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You need some of these elements to be zoomable/re-sizable. First, you need to identify those elements using <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#h-7.5.2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">element identifiers</a>; either the <code>id</code> attribute or the <code>class</code> attribute.</p>

<p>The difference between the two is an <code>id</code> attribute has to be unique; since we need several items to be identified as zoomable, we'll use a <code>class</code> attribute instead. We'll use an appropriate, self-evident value, like <code>zoomable</code>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an example&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h2&gt;Example&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is an example&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p class=""zoomable""&gt;
        Some of this content can be re-sized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;img src=""lenna.jpg"" class=""zoomable iconic"" alt=""a petty lady"" /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element already had a <code>class</code> attribute, but we can assign that element to multiple classes, according the to <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#adef-class"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">w3c recommendation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This attribute assigns a class name or set of class names to an element. Any number of elements may be assigned the same class name or names. Multiple class names must be separated by white space characters.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we've figured out the markup. Now for the JavaScript.</p>

<p>Once we've done that, you can use the <code>document.getElementsByClassName(...)</code> function to get references to all those <code>zoomable</code> elements:</p>

<pre><code>var zoomables = document.getElementByClassName('zoomable');
for(var i=0; i&lt;zoomables.length; i++) {
    zoomables[i].style.height = '100px';
    zoomables[i].style.width = '100px';
    zoomables[i].style.fontSize = '20px';
}
</code></pre>

<p>... but it's not supported in Internet Explorer, so you'll have to use <a href=""http://www.quirksmode.org/js/support.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Object Detection</a> to determine if you need to define it instead:</p>

<pre><code>if(!document.getElementsByClassName) {
    document.getElementsByClassName = function(className) { // this is the simplest, plainest, lowest-invested-time-and-effort
                                                            // version of getElementsByClassName  one can write...
        // you should probably sanitize that className input parameter a bit...
        var allElements = document.getElementsByTagName('*');
        for(var i=0; i&lt;allElements.length; i++) {
            if(/\bclassName\b/.test(allElements[i].className)) {
                allElements[i].style.border = ""2px solid red"";
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>(unemp &lt;- qplot(date, unemploy, data=economics, geom=&quot;line&quot;,

  scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;red&quot;), 0.2)
)
</code></pre>
<p>I can do this with my data:</p>
<pre><code>dists.med.areaplot + geom_rect(

<p>which adds Light and Dark categories to the legend and changes ALL the colours to grey.</p>
<p>If I leave out the <code>scale_fill_manual(values = alpha(c(&quot;#cccccc&quot;, &quot;#000000&quot;), 0.2)</code>, I get the rectangles I expect still with the legend change, but they are completely opaque, on top of my original graph, and use the 1st 2 colours in my colour sequence.</p>
<p>How can I make the geom_rect behind the original plots?</p>

My goal is to populate the various fields in the list on my Sharepoint site with data from the other web service. I'm using a web reference to the Lists Web Service on my Sharepoint server to try and gain access to fields in this particular list on the Sharepoint site.  I have the following code:</p>

I've been using the debugger to analyze each of the above variables to try and find where in the XML this particular list is defined.  Any help or insight is appreciated.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I decided to use the GetList() function and passed the name ""New Hires"" to it.  It ended up grabbing the list above.  Now I'm just trying to see if I can get access to just the fields pictured above, analyzing the xml it seems like those are just display names, the actual fieldID is some alpha numeric string, i.e. Display Name = ""Business Phone"" has the Field ID = ""{fd630629-c165-4513-b43c-fdb16b86a14d}"".

  <p>How does 0x3F800000 relate to the number 1? I assume it is a reference, however I did not get what it refers to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>0x3F800000 is 1.0 in IEEE single precision representation. You could right click on that 0x3F800000 and choose floating point representation to convert it to 1.0.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is MOVS being called three times instead of four (because there are four arguments)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the standard ARM calling convention, the first 4 arguments are stored in R0 to R3 respectively. The <code>ldr r1, =0x3f800000</code> instruction already stores the 2nd argument.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are R0,R1,R2 etc. CPU registers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Could someone explaing these:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please don't take apart non-consecutive instructions, since the r3 at the 2nd instruction and that in the 3rd are different.</p>

<p>If you check the whole function, you should see that ""var_4C"" is the address to the variable <code>ctx</code> on stack. Hence, </p>

<pre><code>add r3, sp, #0x50+var_4c
ldr r2, [r3]
</code></pre>

<p>just means <code>r2 = ctx</code>. The instruction <code>movs r0, r2</code> much later put the context as the 1st argument.</p>

<p>Also, in ARM, var_?? is equivalent to the value -0x??. In ARM, the 5th argument and above are stored on the stack at [sp, #0], [sp, #4], etc. Hence, the instruction</p>

<pre><code>ldr r3, =0x3f800000
str r3, [sp, #0]     ;// #0x50+var_50 = 0x50 - 0x50 = 0

<p>You are correct, to add a reference to jQuery for all pages it is a good idea to use a master page for this purpose.</p>

<p>In the master page, you simply add the HTML script reference to the master page:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;@ MasterPage .... &gt;

&lt;html&gt;

  &lt;script src=""../Scripts/jquery-1.4.1.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p>Add a script element for each of the jQuery scripts. Make sure the jquery-1.4.1.js is the first referenced though.</p>

<p>Also make sure you use the <code>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;script/&gt;</code> due to some browser issues.</p>

<p>Using YUI 2, I'd base the project on the Layout Control and -- as you say -- have an admin page where the admin can set her preference.  If you're not using progressive enhancement, a JSON config file would allow you to write a handler that sets up the layout according to the user's preferences.</p>

<p>You might also want to look at the portal example for other ideas about building full-page apps in YUI 2:</p>

"3478172","<p>I am doing some game-related rendering with Silverlight, and when I attach a pixel shader to an image that has a (rotational) transformation, I am seeing a strange, <em>fuzzy</em>, pixelation effect.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the problem. The image on the left has just a transformation. The image on the right has a transformation and a pixel shader.</p>

<p>You can see this in action <a href=""http://andrewrussell.net/2010/08/silverlight-black-triangle/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here on my blog</a> (click the Silverlight control to add the pixel shader).</p>
<p>The pixel shader in question is the one from SilverSprite used to tint an image's colour. You can <a href=""https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=silversprite#938916"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">view its source code here</a>.</p>
<p>The transformation I am applying is a <code>MatrixTransform</code> (with a hand-calculated translate, scale, rotate matrix). The problem appears when rotating the image.</p>
<p>The element that both the shader and the transform are being applied to is an <code>Image</code> that is added to a <code>Canvas</code> in code. The Image's <code>ImageSource</code> is a <code>WriteableBitmap</code> but the effect also happens with a <code>BitmapImage</code>.</p>
<p>My question is: <strong>what is causing this fuzzy pixelation?</strong> and <strong>what can be done to reduce or remove it?</strong></p>
","Pixelation/filtering issue in Silverlight when using a pixel shader with a rotation transformation","<silverlight><rendering><pixel-shader>","2010-08-13 15:07:30","578","3483369","1","<p>After watching <a href=""http://www.microsoftpdc.com/2009/P09-10"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this presentation</a> from PDC09, I have a much better idea of how the rendering system in Silverlight works. This problem isn't directly addressed by the presentation, but knowing the rendering order of things helps.</p>

<p>The order of the rendering steps relevant to my question is: An object's children (and/or itself) are rendered, that rendering passes through the <code>Effect</code> and then passes through the <code>RenderTransform</code>.</p>

<p>It appears that in any case where a <code>RenderTransform</code> is applied to an object where that object or its children have had an <code>Effect</code> applied (ie: a <code>RenderTransform</code> that comes <em>after</em> an <code>Effect</code> in the rendering tree), that <code>RenderTransform</code> is done in a ""low quality"" mode that produces this ""fuzzyness"".</p>

<p>The solution, then, is to move the <code>Effect</code> to <strong><em>after</em></strong> the <code>RenderTransform</code>. In my case this means putting the <code>Image</code> on its own <code>Canvas</code>, applying the <code>RenderTransform</code> to the <code>Image</code>, and the <code>Effect</code> to the <code>Canvas</code>.</p>

<p>The views can be moved and rotated, but the red tetragons should not touch one another, and not overlay one another. If the corners of the tetragons are known, what is the best way to implement this?</p>

<p>Basically, each of your shapes will be a UIView subclass and you'll just need to respond to the proper touch events to move and rotate them accordingly.

<p>My problem is that our DataTemplate is sort of heavy AND the app could have around 1000 objects using that DataTemplate.</p>

<p>I created a simplistic example where I created 5 Person objects and I bind them to a ListView. The DataTemplate for the Person object is a Grid with a Label and a ContextMenu with 2 MenuItems. For simplicity I just want to concentrate in the MenuItems. Using a memory profiler, I can see that there are a total of 10 MenuItem objects (2 per Person, 5 Person * 2 MenuItem = 10 MenuItem), and I want to know if there is a way to avoid this. Say, every Person object should share the same MenuItem reference, to avoid duplicating the DataTemplate each time a person is created.</p>

Vim will only match when the whole pattern is there, but will exclude everything before <code>\zs</code> and\or after <code>\ze</code> (you don't have to specify both) from the match.</p>

<p>So in your case, you can add <code>\zs</code> after your whitespace pattern and before the bullet/number pattern. For example: <code>/^\s*\zs\d*\./</code></p>

","Haskell list help!","<haskell>","2010-08-14 23:43:06","464","3485702","2","<p>Use a name other than <code>print</code> for your image to avoid collisions with the Prelude's <code>print</code>.</p>

<pre><code>type Pixel = Int
type Row = [Pixel]
type PixelImage = [Row]

img :: PixelImage 
img = [[208,152,240,29],[0,112,255,59],[76,185,0,152]]
</code></pre>

<p>This is an inefficient representation, but it will do for a learning exercise.</p>

<p>You could print a <code>PixelImage</code> with the rows stacked on top of one another with a few imports at the top of your source and an I/O action:</p>

<pre><code>import Control.Monad
import Data.List
import Text.Printf

printImage :: PixelImage -&gt; IO ()
printImage img =
  forM_ img $ putStrLn . intercalate ""  "" . map (printf ""%3d"")
</code></pre>

<p>That may look intimidating, but everything there is familiar. The word order is just a little funny. For each <code>Row</code> in the <code>PixelImage</code> (<a href=""http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/libraries/base-4.2.0.1/Control-Monad.html#v%3AforM_"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>forM_</code></a>, a lot like a <code>for</code> loop in other languages) we print (with <a href=""http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.1/html/libraries/base-4.2.0.0/Prelude.html#v:putStrLn"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>putStrLn</code></a>) the list of <code>Pixel</code> values separated by two spaces (thanks to <a href=""http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.1/html/libraries/base-4.2.0.0/Data-List.html#v:intercalate"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>intercalate</code></a>) and left-padded with spaces to make uniform 3-character fields (<a href=""http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.1/html/libraries/base-4.2.0.0/Text-Printf.html#v:printf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>printf</code></a>).</p>

<p>With the image from your question, we get</p>

<pre>ghci> printImage img
208  152  240   29
  0  112  255   59
 76  185    0  152</pre>

<p>Haskell lists are <em>immutable</em>: you cannot modify one in-place or destructively. Instead, think of it in terms of making a different list that's identical to the original except for the specified row.</p>

<pre><code>modifyRow :: PixelImage -&gt; (Row -&gt; Row) -&gt; Int -&gt; PixelImage
modifyRow img f i = map go (zip [0..] img)
  where go (j,r) | i == j    = f r
                 | otherwise = r
</code></pre>

<p>This gives your function a chance to fire for each <code>Row</code> in the <code>PixelImage</code>. Say you want to zero out a particular row:</p>

<pre>ghci> printImage $ modifyRow img (map $ const 0) 0
  0    0    0    0
  0  112  255   59
 76  185    0  152</pre>

<p>Reversing a row is</p>

<pre>ghci> printImage $ modifyRow img reverse 0
 29  240  152  208
  0  112  255   59
 76  185    0  152</pre>

<p>In another language, you might write <code>img[2] = [1,2,3,4]</code>, but in Haskell it's</p>

<pre>ghci> modifyRow img (const [1..4]) 2
[[208,152,240,29],[0,112,255,59],[1,2,3,4]]</pre>

<p>That usage isn't terribly evocative, so we can defined <code>setRow</code> in terms of <code>modifyRow</code>, a common technique in functional programming.</p>

<pre><code>setRow :: PixelImage -&gt; Row -&gt; Int -&gt; PixelImage
setRow img r i = modifyRow img (const r) i
</code></pre>

<p>Nicer:</p>

<pre>ghci> printImage $ setRow img [4,3,2,1] 1
208  152  240   29
  4    3    2    1
 76  185    0  152</pre>

<p>Maybe you want to scale the pixel values instead.</p>

<pre><code>scaleRow :: (RealFrac a) =&gt; PixelImage -&gt; a -&gt; Int -&gt; PixelImage
scaleRow img x i = modifyRow img f i
  where f = let clamp z | z &lt; 0     = 0
                        | z &gt; 255   = 255
                        | otherwise = truncate z
              in map (clamp . (x *) . fromIntegral)
</code></pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>ghci> printImage $ scaleRow img 0.5 1
208  152  240   29
  0   56  127   29
 76  185    0  152</pre>

<p>Adding <code>scaleImage</code> to apply a scaling factor to each <code>Pixel</code> in a <code>PixelImage</code> means a bit of refactoring to avoid repeating the same code in multiple places. We'd like to be able to use</p>

<pre><code>scaleImage :: (RealFrac a) =&gt; a -&gt; PixelImage -&gt; PixelImage
scaleImage x = map $ scaleOneRow x
</code></pre>

<p>to get, say</p>

<pre>ghci> printImage $ scaleImage 3 img 
255  255  255   87
  0  255  255  177
228  255    0  255</pre>

<p>This means <code>scaleOneRow</code> should be</p>

<pre><code>scaleOneRow :: (RealFrac a) =&gt; a -&gt; Row -&gt; Row
scaleOneRow x = map (clamp . (x *) . fromIntegral)
</code></pre>

<p>which promotes <code>clamp</code> to a toplevel function on <code>Pixel</code> values.</p>

<pre><code>clamp :: (RealFrac a) =&gt; a -&gt; Pixel
clamp z | z &lt; 0     = 0
        | z &gt; 255   = 255
        | otherwise = truncate z
</code></pre>

<p>This in turn simplifies <code>scaleRow</code>:</p>

<pre><code>scaleRow :: (RealFrac a) =&gt; PixelImage -&gt; a -&gt; Int -&gt; PixelImage
scaleRow img x i = modifyRow img (scaleOneRow x) i
</code></pre>

<p>However, I have a shadow effect on a new site (that works the same as the red strips) that works on Firefox, Safari &amp; IE8.</p>

<p>I swear I have used this same method countless times before and it has worked in IE7.</p>

<p>Here is how it looks in IE7. The strips don't grow to the correct height (using IE's <em>developer tools</em> showed me that). They are <em>not</em> just not repeating the background image.</p>

","Why won't this element set to `height: 100%` work in this example in IE7?","<css><internet-explorer-7>","2010-08-17 04:50:01","169","3499477","2","<p>I'm not sure why you would apply your shadows in this manner though. How I usually do it is have a wider container (including the widths of the left/right shadows) aligned center (in this case, it's your #mainContainer div, then set a y-repeating background (that is the shadow - just a couple of pixels high will do). I will then specify another div within this container, smaller width, center aligned, that will contain all the text.</p>

<p>Edit: Just noticed your fiddle. I think it may not work in this case due to css conflicts, possible from the osCommerce stylesheet? I'll try to look deeper..hmm</p>

<p>EDIT2: Okay I've traced it to this particular code in stylesheet.css</p>

<pre><code>#login-link,
#logout-link {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: -20px;
    right: 50px;
    background: #333;

</code></pre>

<p>It's your absolute positioning of this element that's causing the problem. Removing the styling fixes your shadow problems. :)</p>

<p>EDIT FIX:
This should fix it. Or at least it does on my stripped down version of your site layout.
Change #user and #login-link to the following:</p>

<pre><code>#user {
    float: right;
    color: #f90;
    position: relative; /* addition */
}

#login-link,
#logout-link {
    position: absolute;
    top: 31px; /* addition */
    /*bottom: -20px; REMOVED */
    right: 50px;
    height: 15px; /* addition */
    white-space: nowrap; /* addition */
    background: #333;
    padding: 5px;
    text-decoration: none;
    -webkit-border-bottom-right-radius: 5px;
    -webkit-border-bottom-left-radius: 5px;
    -moz-border-radius-bottomright: 5px;
    -moz-border-radius-bottomleft: 5px;
    border-bottom-right-radius: 5px;
    border-bottom-left-radius: 5px;
    z-index: 100;
    font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>

<p>FIX2:</p>

<p>Change</p>

<pre><code>#user-options .bottom-shadow {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
    height: 7px;
    position: absolute;
    bottom: -7px;
    #bottom: -5px;
    left: 0;
    background: url(images/layout/shadow-bottom.png) repeat-x;
    z-index: 50;
}
</code></pre>

<p>TO </p>

<pre><code>.bottom-shadow {
    width: 100%;
    height: 7px;
    margin-top: -10px;
    background: url(images/layout/shadow-bottom.png) repeat-x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And your HTML layout should be:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;div id=""user-options""&gt;
        &lt;div id=""choose-your-country""&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Choose your country &amp;gt; &lt;/p&gt;         
        &lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div id=""user""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;div id=""current-locale""&gt;Golf Ball Busters - AU&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;br class=""clear""&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""bottom-shadow""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Noticed I change <code>bottom-shadow</code> into a div element and moved it out of <code>&lt;div id=""user-options""&gt;</code>. </p>

"3503054","<p>I'm implementing a messaging system in my program. It functions just like e-mail except that it is entirely contained within the system.</p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone has seen an e-mail control template that I could modify. It would have stuff like an inbox, message viewing and message sending parts.</p>

<p>I would just rewire the mail sending &amp; receiving parts to my hook up to my tables.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Ok I didn't realize I wrote so much. Make sure you credit Biff_MaGriff if you use this. :D
Tech is .net 3.5 with SubSonic 3.0</p>

<p>The rest is in my answer.</p>

<p>Should look like this in the end. (Minus all my cut outs)</p>

"3503481","<p>Essentially i want to display a notification just beneath the UINavigationController, covering the area that would be occupied by the top most UIViewController's view. However i want the background image to extend upwards and partly cover the UINavigationBar</p>

<p>The finished product should hopefully look like the below
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Zr7bv.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The trick comes in that i only want this to apply to certain views with the view Hierarchy, so attacking the problem by using <code>[UIApplication keyWindow]</code> might not be the best idea. Also i assume that by using views outside of the private <code>UINavigationTransitionView</code> won't be part of the view transition animation, leaving my view on top of the controller beneath when this one is popped.</p>

<p>The view of the topmost view controller doesn't help either, as it's frame is terminates at the base of <code>UINavigationBar</code>, meaning arrow won't overlap the <code>UINavigationBar</code></p>

<p>Suggestions?</p>

"3504652","<p>I have defined an object type in .NET that I want receive in a List&lt;> as the input to an ASP.NET MVC action method? </p>

<p>Here is where things get interesting. When the javascript is called and there were two rows in the table that are supposed to be passed to the MVC action, notice how when I debug into the code that there were two objects created in the list but their properties weren't filled.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/5lDdK.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>What am I doing wrong that is preventing my Javascript object from being converted into a .NET List&lt;> type? Should I be using array? Do I need to mark something as serializable?</p>

<p>i think the problem here is about the labels. 
when you make a List&lt;> of items, in a normal view, with a foreach loop for example, the labels of the values have keys. you are missing those keys, and i think thats why it doesnt work.</p>

<p>for example, i have a List which i make with jQuery, but send in a normal postback.</p>

<p>in the FormCollection object i get the following keys</p>

<pre><code>    [0] ""Vrbl_Titel""    string
    [1] ""Sch_ID""    string
    [2] ""Vragen[0].Evvr_Vraag""  string
    [3] ""Vragen[0].Evvr_Type""   string
    [4] ""Vragen[1].Evvr_Vraag""  string
    [5] ""Vragen[1].Evvr_Type""   string
    [6] ""Vragen[2].Evvr_Vraag""  string
    [7] ""Vragen[2].Evvr_Type""   string
</code></pre>

<p>a Vragen object has 2 strings, as you can see, so this is how it looks, and i guess this is how you have to make it in jQuery, before posting it to the server.</p>

<p>be careful though, the integer between the brackets should be without interruption. if you have an interruption (for example, 0 1 2 4 5 6) then MVC will stop at 2. </p>

I have the following line in a function called when the <code>body</code> loads:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#buttonSetDiv"").buttonset();
</code></pre>

<p>I'm also including the CSS and JS correctly, like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style src=""jquery-ui-1.8.4.custom/css/ui-darkness/jquery-ui-1.8.4.custom.css""&gt;&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""jquery-1.4.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""jquery-ui-1.8.4.custom/js/jquery-ui-1.8.4.custom.min.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... and the actual HTML looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form name=""radios"" id=""myForm""&gt;
&lt;div id=""buttonSetDiv""&gt;
&lt;input type=""radio"" name=""group1"" value=""posts"" id=""radio1"" checked onchange=""valueChanged()""&gt; &lt;label for=""radio1""&gt;Posts&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type=""radio"" name=""group1"" value=""members"" onchange=""valueChanged()"" id=""radio2""&gt;
&lt;label for=""radio2""&gt;Members&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>... but for some reason, with this <em>seemingly</em> correct implementation, I'm still getting normal-looking radio buttons. I'd like to achieve this effect:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/G8tI4.jpg"" alt=""picture""></p>

<p>Does anyone have an answer here? Thanks a ton in advance. :)</p>

<li>The dropdown menu <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> has a solid border all around it and is position absolute.  When it appears, it is positioned 1px under its invoking link (which makes it look like the dotted and solid borders are on the same line).</li>

"3509934","<p>at first i'm really new to ORM, nhibernate and FHN. i look into this stuff for a few days now.
i have an existing database with 4 tables:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/B8Waz.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>so i tried first to get the Auswahl and RefAuswahlFilter to work.</p>

<p>here are my DomainObjects: pls let me know when i can do this better </p>

<pre><code>[Serializable]
public class Auswahl
{
    public Auswahl()
    {
        this.RefFilters = new List&lt;RefAuswahlFilter&gt;();
    }

    public virtual IList&lt;RefAuswahlFilter&gt; RefFilters { get; set; }

    //...rest of the Properties

[Serializable]
public class RefAuswahlFilter
{
    public virtual Auswahl Auswahl { get; set; }
    public virtual long Filterrank { get; set; }
    public virtual string Filter { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>here are my mappings:</p>

<pre><code>public class AuswahlMap : ClassMap&lt;Auswahl&gt;
{
    public AuswahlMap()
    {
        Table(""AUSWAHL"");

        Id(x =&gt; x.Id)
            .GeneratedBy.Sequence(""SEQ_AUSWAHL"");

        Map(x =&gt; x.Programm);
        Map(x =&gt; x.Variante);
        Map(x =&gt; x.Returnkey);
        Map(x =&gt; x.Beschreibung);

        HasMany&lt;RefAuswahlFilter&gt;(x =&gt; x.RefFilters);

    }
}

public class RefAuswahlFilterMap : ClassMap&lt;RefAuswahlFilter&gt;
{
    public RefAuswahlFilterMap()
    {
        Table(""REFAUSWAHLFILTER"");

        CompositeId()
            .KeyReference(x =&gt; x.Auswahl,""IDAUSWAHL"")
            .KeyProperty(x =&gt; x.Filterrank,""FILTERANK"");

        Map(x =&gt; x.Filter);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>if i run my app i got a list with all my Auswahl rows.</p>

<pre><code>var l = session.CreateCriteria(typeof(Auswahl)).List&lt;Auswahl&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>but when i look into an item to get the RefFilters the debugger show the following error:</p>

<p><em>innerException {""ORA-00904: \""REFFILTERS0</em>\"".\""AUSWAHL_ID\"": ung√ºltiger Bezeichner\n""} </p>

<p>could not initialize a collection: [ORMTest.DomainModel.Auswahl.RefFilters#1097][SQL: SELECT reffilters0_.Auswahl_id as Auswahl4_1_, reffilters0_.IDAUSWAHL as IDAUSWAHL1_, reffilters0_.FILTERANK as FILTERANK1_, reffilters0_.IDAUSWAHL as IDAUSWAHL3_0_, reffilters0_.FILTERANK as FILTERANK3_0_, reffilters0_.Filter as Filter3_0_ FROM REFAUSWAHLFILTER reffilters0_ WHERE reffilters0_.Auswahl_id=?]</p>

<p>so i think something on my mapping is wrong, but i really dont get it.</p>

"3511820","<p>I'm a member of a small but fairly sociable online forum, and just for fun we've been plotting a chart of who's met who in real life. Here's what it looked like fairly recently.
(The colour is the ""distance"" from the currently-selected user, e.g., yellow is someone who's met someone who's met them. And no, I'm not Zak.) Apologies for the faded lines, they don't seem to have weathered the SO upload process very well.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/u6UTR.png"" alt=""Link chart""></p>

<p>It's generated as SVG, with a big block of JSON defining who's met who. The position (x,y) of each member on the chart is hard-coded into that JSON. Until now, it's been fairly easy to cope when someone meets someone else - at worst, maybe two or three people need to be shuffled around - but it does involve editing the co-ordinates manually. And now that the European and North American contingents are meeting up, and a few on the periphery are showing up at meets, all hell is breaking loose...</p>

<p>We can put some effort into making all the nodes draggable, which would make the job of re-arranging a bit less tiresome. But it seems more sensible to let the computer take care of positioning them, especially as the problem will only get harder with more members.</p>

<p>So, does anyone know of an algorithm for positioning these nodes on the chart, based on which other nodes they're linked with? </p>

<p>Ideally, it would </p>

<ul>
<li>minimise or avoid long links</li>
<li>avoid having lines run underneath unrelated nodes</li>
<li>take account of the fact that well-connected nodes are bigger</li>
<li>do its best to show the wider ""all these guys met each other"" relationships (the big circle at the bottom is largely the result of one meet, for example, though the chart has no idea of <strong>when</strong> any two people met)</li>
</ul>

<p>but if it gets us close enough to tweak it, that's progress.</p>

<p>And, what's the real name for these charts? I believe they're called ""link charts"", but I'm not getting good results from Google using that name or anything else I can think of.</p>

<p>We'll likely be implementing this in PHP or Javascript, but right now it's how to begin approaching the problem that's the bigger question.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Some great answers coming already. I would be very interested in the actual algorithm(s) used, though, as well as tools that do the job.</p>

"3512774","<p>I've got a strange error with IE8 and postcode lookups. It may not be postcode lookups as such that's causing it - just an AJAX call that modifies a select.

<p>I understand that the IDE will create the <em>variable</em> for me.  I want it to create the <em>variable name</em> for me.</p>

<p>I don't want to have to type ""firstName"".  I like the variable name the parameter author chose, and I want to use that variable name in my (calling) code.</p>

<p>Is there a way to have these acceptable variable <em>names</em> re-generated for me (the calling code) automatically as I move, parameter by parameter, through this line of (calling) code?</p>

<ul>
<li>Type <code>p.Foo(</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This will open the description of the currently selected constructor, out of the list of all constructors.  If you type a letter, or hit ctrl + space, intellisense auto completion will open.</p>

<p>A difference here between VS2008 and VS2010 is named parameters.  In VS2010, your completion list will have entries for the named parameters <code>firstName:</code> and <code>lastName:</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Type the first letter of the parameter name (what you are referring to as ""the variable name the parameter author chose"")</li>
</ul>

<p>Intellisense should jump straight to that entry, and allow you to do completion the same way it usually does.</p>

<ul>
<li>Type a space, enter, or comma</li>
</ul>

<p>Intellisense it will insert the identifier used for the named parameter.  It won't insert the colon (unless you type it), so you don't have to use the named parameter feature to accomplish your goal here.  You can just take advantage of the fact that the text you are looking for is in your completion list.</p>

<p>How you get Visual Studio to actually generate the local variables (which, according to your question, it seems like you have already solved) baffles me, and would be up to you to take care of :)  If you've got that second problem licked, I'd like to know how, too.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR-version</strong>: How to efficiently query and update entities having relationships to other entities?</p>

<p>Here's an interesting data modeling scenario with two tables that has been puzzling me:</p>

<pre><code>Entities { ID, Name, ScalarValue }

ComponentEntities { AggregateEntityID, ComponentEntityID, quantity }
</code></pre>

<p><code>AggregateEntityID</code> and <code>ComponentEntityID</code> are foreign keys to the <code>Entities</code> table.</p>

<p><strong>Give me the bloody example already</strong></p>

<pre><code>Drinks { ID, Name, Alcohol% }

DrinkIngredients { CocktailID, IngredientID, amount }

Drinks { 1, ""Vodka"", 40% }
Drinks { 2, ""Tomato juice"", 0% }
Drinks { 3, ""Tabasco"", 0% }
Drinks { 4, ""Bloody mary"", - }

DrinkIngredients { 4, 1, 0.2 } // Bloody mary has 0.2*Vodka
DrinkIngredients { 4, 2, 0.7 } // Bloody mary has 0.7*Tomato juice
DrinkIngredients { 4, 3, 0.1 } // Bloody mary has 0.1*Tabasco

<p>If we wanted to get Bloody Mary's alcohol contents, we would <code>SELECT * FROM DrinkIngredients WHERE CocktailID == 4</code>.</p>

<p>Pretty standard; nothing weird there. Lisa likes to make it a bit sweeter by adding some Passion to it:</p>

<pre><code>Drinks { 6, ""Passion"", 13% }
Drinks { 7, ""Bloody Mary Pink"", - }

DrinkIngredients { 7, 4, 0.8 }  // Bloody Mary Pink has 0.8*Bloody Mary
DrinkIngredients { 7, 6, 0.2 }  // Bloody Mary Pink has 0.2*Passion
</code></pre>

<p>Lisa's mum has been tasting these for so long that she believes she has found the ultimate blend between the two:</p>

<pre><code>Drinks { 8, ""Bloody Milf"", - }
DrinkIngredients { 8, 4, 0.45 } // Bloody Milf has 0.45*Bloody Mary
DrinkIngredients { 8, 7, 0.55 } // Bloody Milf has 0.55*Bloody Mary Pink
</code></pre>

<p>Add couple more of these <strong><em>consists of</em></strong> levels and we have a deep relational recursion. The only restriction is that entity cannot consist of itself.</p>

<p>This seem to form a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">directed acyclic graph</a>.</p>

<p>RDBMS: One way to ""cache"" the data would be to calculate relevant data and store it in the Entity itself (or perhaps in another table). In the example above, the alcohol content for Bloody Mary would calculated once when it's created and stored in its Alcohol% field. In this case, updates become expensive because we have to update every drink (along with the whole dependency hierarchy) consisting of the updated one.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>RDBMS: Is there a better way to get to the leaf values (drinks that don't consist of other ones) than getting the ""parent"" drink until a leaf drink is reached?</p>

<p>Both, RDBMS and NoSQL, have a problem with this: one way or the other.</p>

<p>Bottom-line: is this even practical and feasible?</p>

<p>Don't understand this.  Drinks that don't consist of other ones has nothing to do with recursion.  It's a simple EXCEPT or WHERE NOT EXISTS.</p>

<p>And ""getting to the leaf values"" (given a parent) will inevitably require traversing the tree, regardless of the data structure (relational or hierarchical) used to model it, wouldn't you think ?</p>

<p>Both, RDBMS and NoSQL, have a problem with this: one way or the other.</p>

<p>RDBMS don't really have a problem with this.  The problem was already identified a few decades ago (80's or so), and was addressed by amending the relational algebra with a transitive closure operation, and a generalized version of it.  SQL supports this through recursive queries, and as Frank said, at least all the big dogs all support recursive queries one way or the other.</p>

<p>Writing recursive queries isn't exactly trivial if you've never done it before.  Does that make it ""unpractical"" ?  I wouldn't know.</p>

<p>As the data source, your job is to return (and receive, in the case of user editing) the object values for the cells in the columns.</p>

<p>But you're not returning such a value; you're returning a cell. Thus, you're trying to set an image cell (created by the data source) as the value of an image cell (the existing one owned by the column).</p>

<p>The log message suggests that you have already set the column's cell as an image cell when you created the column, so all you need to do now is change your data source to always return the object value for the column, not a cell. For an image column, return the image. For a text column, return the string.</p>

<p>Note that NSTableView does not work like UITableView, where UITableViewCells are UIViews and you have as many cells as rows on the screen; in NSTableView, each NSTableColumn gets <em>one and only one data cell</em>, and that one cell is used to draw that column of every row. The cell draws its object value, which you provide to the cell, which you do by returning it (the object value) from your data source method.</p>

","Flex: Listening for CollectionEvent in custom component","<apache-flex><e4x><xmllist>","2010-08-18 22:37:39","667","3518163","2","<p>Two things:</p>

<p>1) The reason your event is not firing is because you are adding the listener after you set <code>_xlist</code>.</p>

<p>2) You should not be adding an event listener within your setter anyways.  You should add it on the initialize or creationComplete events of your VBox component.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Alright, after looking at your code again I can see the problem... so just a few more things.</p>

<p>3) Why are you naming a method <code>init</code>, when it gets called on <code>creationComplete</code>?  You should get into the habit of naming methods appropriately.  For example, the method that gets called on <code>creationComplete</code> should be named: <code>onCreationComplete</code>, or <code>handleCreationComplete</code>  That way, you will know what your code is doing 6 months down the road.</p>

<p>4) This is your main problem: You are using the getters / setters in appropriately.  If you have a setter, you should also implement a getter (unless you have a write-only field).  More importantly, you should <em>use</em> the getter to access your data.  In your <code>xListChanged</code> method you are not using the setter you have defined, thus nothing is getting told the <code>_xlist</code> actually changed.  As such, you should change your code to:</p>

<pre><code>private var _xlist:XMLListCollection;

[Bindable]
public function get xlist():XMLListCollection { return this._xlist; }
public function set xlist(value:XMLListCollection):void
{
    this._xlist = value;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever you want to access <code>_xlist</code>, use the GETTER.  For example, change the dataProvider of your <code>List</code> component to be <code>{xlist}</code>.  And the <code>xListChanged</code> method should be using the getter: <code>xlist</code> instead of directly accessing the member <code>_xlist</code>.</p>

","Does my PHP security algorithm effectively store user credentials?","<php><security><passwords><authentication>","2010-08-20 02:52:51","288","3527966","2","<p><strong>Are there any inherit flaws with this algorithm?</strong></p>

<p>It's not open to rainbow attacks (due to the random salt). Sha512 is a fairly new algorithm, but currently has no known collisions, so it's probably pretty safe. The way your storing passwords is done well. The checking process is also important (rate limiting bruteforce attacks) and locking down the servers from attacks from other angles which could try to get access to the database. If an attacker was able to gain access to the database, he could probably extract out simple passwords fairly quickly, but any complex password would probably beyond a simple bruteforce attack (even if he had direct access to the hashes).</p>

<p><strong>Is it OK to store the salt in the same database and table as the salt+password hash?</strong></p>

<p>You pretty much have to store them together if you want to be able to validate the passwords (I assume you want to). The main reason for salting a password is to remove the possibility of a rainbow attack. Often this data is even stored in the same column as the hashed password using a symbol to separate them.</p>

<p><strong>Will having a large 128 character password cause login performance issues (on a magnitude of several seconds) if I have several hundred thousand users in the table?</strong></p>

<p>Benchmark how long (in seconds) it takes to check a password (<code>hash('sha512', $salt.$password_attempt )</code>). Find the inverse of that number, and that's probably close to how many password attempts you can handle per second per CPU core.</p>

<p><strong>Can this data be reversed to produce the original password?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, but it would take alot of effort, since your using a random salt, rainbow tables will no longer work, and sha512 takes a fair amount of CPU to run and has no known collisions. If the password was fairly simple it could be guessed. If your worried about reversing the hashes, putting a low bound on the complexity of the password might be a good idea (checking it against a dictionary, does it contain upper/lower/numbers/symbols).</p>

It holds data like log_flush_rate ,send_queue_size,send_rate,redo_queue_size,redo_rate,transaction_delay and transactions_per_sec with database names. Then i wondered how is this table populated.

This job runs every minute.</p>

<p>The alert was generated for example at 11:23:52.
The jobs only runs once a minute, still it managed to capture data at 11:23:00 and then at 11:23:52 (when the alert was generated) that is twice in the minute.</p>

<p>I thought that may be, when the alert is generated, it also runs this stored procedure. If it updated the table, then I can just run a select statement. But how can I be sure?</p>

how can I find out why this table was updated without schedule? what triggered its population? Does anyone know which table holds alerts history data?</p>

You could start with the list of outlines, then scan the whole window by row and column: whenever you crossed a boundary, you would increment or decrement (depending on the sense of the crossing) a counter <code>how_many_outlines_am_I_inside</code>. When it's zero, paint the pixel white, otherwise paint it green (and I guess black for the boundary itself). This will handle self-intersecting curves correctly.</p>

<p>Now for the shades. Judging by your example, shading is uniform vertically, but changes horizontally, scaled to the full width of the outline. So instead of a simple counter, you'll need a stack (I recommend stl::list) of outlines, so that you can keep track of which outline (of the ones you're inside) is uppermost, so that you can calculate what fraction of the distance you've covered from x<sub>min</sub> to x<sub>max</sub>. Finally for the translucency (as with the star partly visible through the rectangle): you'll have to decide on the rules yourself, I can't infer them by eyeball, but the stack should make it easy to implement.</p>

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The jQuery is : </p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {

        var width = $('#h').width();
        var height = $('#l').height();
        var pad = $('#h').position().left;
        var actWidth = width + pad;
        var nHeight = height - (height * 2);
        var rLeftMargin = actWidth + 1;
        var bWidth = actWidth + 2;

        $('#r').css({'margin-top':nHeight});
        $('#h').css({'height':25});
        $('#r').css({'margin-left':rLeftMargin});
        $('#r').css({'height':height});
        $('#b').css({'width':bWidth});
        $('#b').css({'margin-top':0});
    }
)
</code></pre>

<p>And the CSS is :</p>

<pre><code>.h{
background-image:url('images//line.jpg');
background-repeat: repeat-x;
padding-left:10px; 
color:white;
}
.l{

"3531129","<p>I usually have no problems with making CSS sprites, but this one has got me stumped...and I'm not sure how to solve it. Basically I have a navigation sprite that looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/jg4lN.png"" alt=""nasdaq-ad-network-nav-sprit.png""></p>

<p>I'm using the standard convention of laying them out in <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags such like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li class=""welcome""&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" title=""welcome""&gt;welcome&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

<p>And then applying CSS to adjust the background position:</p>

<pre><code>#navigation li.welcome a {
  width:155px;
  background-position:-0px -46.5px; }
</code></pre>

<p>Of course I didn't think of this, but the problem happens on hover. Since you can only define ""square"" areas, when you hover over an element, the ""blue"" hover state is being carried over to the next navigation item. </p>

<p>I then thought that I'd have to make individual images for each item... but that wouldn't work quite right either because of the overlapping arrow sections.</p>

<p>Maybe I have to seperate out the ""in between"" arrow seperators? I'm really not sure.</p>

"3531937","<p>I am trying to map an enum property (instance of System.DayOfWeek) in my model to an integer database field.
Other enum properties in the model should be mapped to strings, so I don't wish to define a convention.</p>

<p>I understand that this should be possible using a fluent mapping like:</p>

<pre><code>Map(x =&gt; x.DayOfWeek).CustomType&lt;int&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>and indeed, at first glance this appears to be working.</p>

<p>However, I noticed that instances of entities with properties mapped in this way are being updated every time the session was flushed, even though no amendments have been made to them.</p>

<p>To find out what is causing this flush, I set up an IPreUpdateEventListener, and inspected the OldState and State of the entity.
See the attached image. In the OldState, the relevant object is an int, whereas in State it is a DayOfWeek.</p>

<p>If I use an HBM XML mapping with no type attribute specified, this issue doesn't arise.</p>

<p>So...</p>

<p>Is this a bug or shortcoming in the GenericEnumMapper?
Is there any way of telling the FNH mapping not to specify any type attribute on the generated HBM?
If not, can I specify the default type that NH uses for enums (and what is that)?</p>

Essentially, I'm looking into ""how"" to code a solution that runs on the web server within the cloud that will send a print command to a printer within office 1 (label printer).  </p>

<p>The print job is really part of work flow within the ASP.NET web application and I would like to keep all of the code within a single application if possible.  How can I go about doing this?</p>

<p>Due to security, I should avoid creating a new application within Office 1 that pulls data from the ""cloud"" and have the ""cloud"" be used to push the command downward.  I'm really looking at this from a code standpoint within the ASP.NET app and also potentially transcending into more of a serverfault/superuser question on the printer.  I'll save that for a future question there though.</p>

The classfile structure had changed in 1.5 due to the introduction of several new features and changes made in the Java Language Specification.</p>

<p>From the error, one can deduce that a Java 1.4 classfile was expected, whereas a Java 1.5 classfile was found. It appears that the compiler is a Java 1.4 compiler, so you should attempt to verify whether you're using the right version of the Java compiler and also the right JDK (i.e. JDK home).</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM</strong></p>

<p>Ant tends to look for the javac executable in the $JAVA_HOME/bin/javac . If the JAVA_HOME environment variable has been set incorrectly, say to a Java 1.4 home, then there is a likelihood of getting the described error even in Eclipse.</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDUM #2</strong></p>

<p>The addition of entries to the PATH environment variable <em>could result</em> in altering the search classpath behavior of Ant, possibly resulting in a different tools.jar being used for the purpose of compiling the sources.

"3535781","<h2>1. Compiled Assembly from JSC</h2>

<p>I've compiled what is intended to be client-side JavaScript using the JScript compiler (jsc.exe) on the server side in an attempt to make something that can be tested from a unit testing project, and maybe even something that can be debugged on the server side. </p>

<p>The compiled file <em>contains only functions</em> as follows (just for example) and it compiles fine into BitField.exe. Notice, no wrapper class or package in the source code.</p>

<p>------ BEGIN FILE (BitField.js) -------</p>

<pre><code>function BitField(){
    this.values = [];
}
// more functions ...
</code></pre>

<p>------- END FILE -------   </p>

<pre><code>jsc /fast-  /out:BitField.exe Bitfield.js
</code></pre>

<p>Results in a BitField.exe assembly.</p>

<p><strong>Success!</strong> Well, kind of ....</p>

<hr>

<h2>2. Testing Assembly / Access Point?</h2>

<p>Secondly I've created a test project (in C#) and referenced in the BitField.exe assembly successfully.  (The type of project is irrelevant but I'm providing more description to paint a full picture.)</p>

<p>The problem seems to be: <strong>I cannot find the namespace or a point at which I can access the BitField functions inside the BitField.exe assembly from my C# test project</strong>.  The assembly doesn't seem to be a ""normal"".   </p>

<p>In other words I need in C# </p>

<pre><code>using ???WHAT???
</code></pre>

<p><em>Note</em>: I don't want to use JScript ""extensions"", meaning keywords that won't run client-side (in a web browser), for example, <code>class</code>, <code>package</code> etc because I want the code to be clean as possible for copy &amp; paste back into client side script environment (Regardless said ""clean"" code compiles fine by jsc.exe without use of those extensions).  When I try to wrap the functions in <code>package</code> and <code>class</code> it starts producing compile errors so that's another reason not to use them - because they appear to make me alter my code. </p>

<p>Any suggestions as to how I can use the functions of the compiled JScript assembly (by having it referenced into another assembly) when there are no explicit containers in it?</p>

If you try to compile a js file that contains functions into a .Net library assembly, you get an error:</p>

<pre><code>BitField.js(1,1) : error JS1234: Only type and package definitions are allowed inside a library
</code></pre>

<p>But, there is hope, yet!  Here's what I would do...</p>

<p>I would keep your ""clean"" BitField.js file just as it is, and then create a batch file that wraps it in a JScript class and writes it out to a ""dirty"" js file.  It's pretty clean if you think of it as part of the compilation of the code into the DLL.  The code to wrap the BitField.js into BitFieldClass.js would look like this: </p>

<p><em>merge-into-class.js</em></p>

<pre><code>var fso = new ActiveXObject(""Scripting.FileSystemObject"");
var ForReading = 1;
var inputFile = fso.OpenTextFile(""BitField.js"",ForReading, false);
var outputFile = fso.CreateTextFile(""BitFieldClass.js"", true);

outputFile.write(""class BitFieldClass{\n"");
while (!inputFile.AtEndOfStream)
{
    var textLine = inputFile.ReadLine();
    outputFile.write (textLine + ""\n"");
}
outputFile.write(""}"");
outputFile.close();
</code></pre>

<p>Then the batch file to wrap it and compile it is really simple: </p>

<p><em>compile-js.bat</em></p>

<pre><code>cscript merge-into-class.js
jsc /t:library /out:BitFieldClass.dll bitFieldClass.js
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, if you wanted to do multiple files, you'd have to parameterize things a bit, but hopefully this is enough to demonstrate the idea.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Hierarchy diagram for this data:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/9nkEz.png"" alt=""Hierarchy diagram""></p>

<p>I want to write a query that will return a single row for any given [id] value. The row should contain that row's [id] and [parentID] information.  It should also contain the [largeData1...n] fields.  However, if a largeData field is null, then it should traverse up the hierarchy until a non-null value for that field is encountered.  It should, in short, function like the coalesce function, except across a hierarchy of rows instead of a set of columns.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><strong>Where [id] = 1:</strong></p>

<pre><code>id:          1
parentID:    null
largeData1:  blah blah blah
largeData2:  null
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Where [id] = 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>id:          1
parentID:    1
largeData1:  blah blah blah
largeData2:  null
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Where [id] = 3</strong></p>

<pre><code>id:          3
parentID:    1
largeData1:  foo bar foobar
largeData2:  null
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Where [id] = 4</strong></p>

<pre><code>id:          4
parentID:    3
largeData1:  foo bar foobar
largeData2:  lorem ipsum
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Where [id] = 5</strong></p>

<pre><code>id:          5
parentID:    4
largeData1:  foo bar foobar
largeData2:  lorem ipsum
</code></pre>

<p>So far, I have this:</p>

<pre><code>Declare @id Integer; Set @id = 5;

With heirarchy
    (id, parentID, largeData1, largeData2, [level])
As (
    Select id, parentID, largeData1,
           largeData2, 1 As [level]
    From example
    Where id = @id

    Union All

    Select parent.id, parent.parentID,
           parent.largeData1,
           parent.largeData2,
           child.[level] + 1 As [level]
    From example As parent
    Inner Join heirarchy As child
        On parent.id = child.parentID)

Select id, parentID,
   (Select top 1 largeData1
    From heirarchy
    Where largeData1 Is Not Null
    Order By [level] Asc) As largeData1,

   (Select top 1 largeData2
    From heirarchy
    Where largeData2 Is Not Null
    Order By [level] Asc) As largeData2

From example
Where [id] = @id;
</code></pre>

<p>This returns the results that I am looking for.  However, according to the query plan, it is making a separate pass through the hierarchy for each largeData field that I pull back.</p>

<p><strong>How can I make this more efficient?</strong></p>

<p>This is obviously a simplified version of a more complex problem.  The final query will return data in XML format, so any solutions involving the FOR XML clause are perfectly fine.</p>

<p>I can create a CLR aggregate function for this, if doing so would help.  I have not yet explored that route.</p>

<p>Basically, start at your target node and walk up the tree, replacing your null columns with not-null values if and when they are found.</p>

<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/grD3P.png"" alt=""Screenshot of post parent dropdown list"" /></p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> I have built a relatively complex WP site for a client which is more of a CMS than a blog and relies on a hierarchy of pages being built. (Well, they're actually custom post types with <code>'hierarchical' =&gt; true</code> set)</p>
<p><strong>My question:</strong> is it possible to show draft (or pending review) pages in the page attributes 'Parent page' dropdown list? Without this, it means making each page live before the whole section is ready - and that's not a suitable solution.</p>
<p><strong>What I've tried:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Looking for an action which gets called to build the list (can't find one)</li>
<li>Looking in the source code for where the list is created (it's built with <a href=""http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_dropdown_pages"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wp_dropdown_pages</a> which doesn't appear to let you choose the post status)</li>
<li>Looking for plugins which provide this functionality</li>
</ul>

"3538546","<p>I was wondering if there was any way to feature a custom title with my own drawable -- and then subsequently put a progress bar in the title layout so that it acts like the built in android progress bar. </p>

<p>In my code -- I want to be able to call <code>setProgressBarIndeterminateVisibility(true)</code> and have that display the progress bar in my custom title bar. </p>

<p>Is this possible?</p>

<p>I have set up my application theme so that it uses a custom title -- but I don't how or where to put the progress bar in that layout. </p>

<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

<p>EDIT: Right now I use my own theme that looks something like this: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;style parent=""android:Theme.Light.NoTitleBar"" name=""BaseTheme""&gt;
    &lt;item name=""android:windowBackground""&gt;@drawable/splash_bg&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item name=""android:windowTitleStyle""&gt;@style/TitleBackground&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>With the title background style as :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style name=""TitleBackground"" parent=""android:WindowTitleBackground""&gt;
    &lt;item name=""android:background""&gt;@drawable/title_bar&lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/style&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To give everyone a better idea -- something like this.

You COULD override the android code since its open source -- but that might be a bad idea. The best thing to do is to make a title bar layout and just <code>&lt;include /&gt;</code> it in all the other layouts and maybe have a helper class to show and hide the progress bar. </p>

"3538946","<p>I am trying to create smaller tabs in android -- but I can't seem to get it to work because all that happens when I create a smaller tab is that it shows the bigger tab -- but without a drawable. </p>

<p>Do note however that the author of this plugin consider it obsolete, and the jQuery UI autocomplete to be its successor. In a 'How to migrate' post he points users now to, the rational jQuery UI not having the <code>autofill</code> option is explained: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>autoFill:</strong> Gone with no immediate
  replacement available, for good
  reasons: The default behaviour when
  selecting items via keyboard now puts
  the focussed value into the input,
  like the Firefox Awesomebar does it.
  It's not the same as what the autoFill
  option did, but there should be no
  need to recreate that effect.</p>

<p>If you've been reading on ggplot then maybe the only thing you're missing is combining your two data frames into one long one.</p>
<p>So, let's start with something like what you have, two separate sets of data and combine them.</p>
<pre><code>carrots &lt;- data.frame(length = rnorm(100000, 6, 2))
cukes &lt;- data.frame(length = rnorm(50000, 7, 2.5))

# Now, combine your two dataframes into one.  
# First make a new column in each that will be 
# a variable to identify where they came from later.
carrots$veg &lt;- 'carrot'
cukes$veg &lt;- 'cuke'

# and combine into your new data frame vegLengths
vegLengths &lt;- rbind(carrots, cukes)
</code></pre>
<p>After that, which is unnecessary if your data is in long format already, you only need one line to make your plot.</p>
<pre><code>ggplot(vegLengths, aes(length, fill = veg)) + geom_density(alpha = 0.2)
</code></pre>
<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Q9GDn.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></p>
<p>Now, if you really did want histograms the following will work. Note that you must change position from the default &quot;stack&quot; argument. You might miss that if you don't really have an idea of what your data should look like. A higher alpha looks better there. Also note that I made it density histograms. It's easy to remove the <code>y = ..density..</code> to get it back to counts.</p>
<pre><code>ggplot(vegLengths, aes(length, fill = veg)) + 
   geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, aes(y = ..density..), position = 'identity')

"3541823","<p>Hey guys, I'm using GWT for a data-driven web application, and I'm having issues with a CellTable embedded in a TabLayoutPanel. As you can see from the screenshot, the scroll bar for the table does not appear inside the bounds of the TabLayoutPanel. (You can see just a couple pixels of it on the right.) If I mouse over the TabLayoutPanel in the inspector, it properly shows the boundary ending at that black border on the right.</p>

<p>For some reason I haven't been able to determine, the TabLayoutPanelContent object is extending outside the bounds of its parent, the TabLayoutPanel. Has anyone run into an issue like this before? Or does anyone see an issue in the HTML/CSS that might suggest a solution? I'm sure it's something minor, but it's frustratingly difficult to find.</p>

<p>TIA! </p>

<p>I had apparently set the width of one-too-many widgets to 100%. (Between the TabLayoutPanel, ScrollPanel, CellTable, etc.) I just removed all the width constraints, then slowly added them as needed until the UI was as desired.</p>

"3541943","<p>I have a gridview that is inflated by multiple buttons. I used just a gridview and it worked fine. The grid was in correct order and was centered. Although, I wanted to add a button below the grid of buttons that was different and centered. To do this I decided to section off the gridview and then add the button (therefore it wouldn't be affected by the gridview). I tried the following code to seperate the views:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;  
&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
android:layout_width=""fill_parent""

    android:layout_height=""fill_parent""

        &lt;GridView

            android:gravity=""center""&gt;
            &lt;!--

        &lt;/GridView&gt;
    &lt;/TableRow&gt;
    &lt;TableRow android:gravity=""center""&gt;
        &lt;Button android:text=""Submit"" 
            android:id=""@+id/submit"" 
            android:layout_width=""wrap_content"" 
            android:layout_height=""wrap_content""&gt;
        &lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/TableRow&gt;
&lt;/TableLayout&gt;
&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that this code smushes the gridview to the left and oddly it flips it (Position 0 is ont he bottom right and the last button is on the top left pushed off screen). The following image shows what is the result:</p>

<p><img src=""https://img.photobucket.com/albums/v68/authoreety/gridview_problem.png""></p>

<p>Any idea why its pushed to the left and flipped? Or maybe how I could have just the Gridview with the button on the bottom?</p>

<p>To do this in visual studio you will have to manually edit the designer generated code. Or place the radio buttons outside of the form and use your arrow keys to place it in the correct location. </p>

<p>Both the top-level services and lower-level services end with ""Service"" in the simple name and the DAOs with ""DAO"".</p>

<p>The strict division is necessary in most of our applications because the top level services return DTOs to be used in DWR services or MVC web views. Lower level services do not have such constraints as they are not directly exposed to the View layer in MVC usage. </p>

</code></pre>

<p>The text in the table (that is, the header cells text and the standard cells text) is generated server-side based on a database, so the values in them can be quite long or quite short (with a reasonable maximum length). The bosses want it as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The two columns must be justified against each other in the middle, with a small space inbetween.</li>
<li>The table should expand so that all the text in each cell is on the same row.</li>
<li>The title (""Details"") should always be centered between the two columns, no matter what the ratio of widths are (as they will normally be about 60:40).</li>
</ul>

<p>I think I've managed to capture 1 and 2 okay - this table should expand if you add longer <code>th/td</code> s, and it should likewise get smaller if you remove them - but I'm struggling with number 3. I'm just not sure how to do it at all. I've tried using a <code>&lt;caption&gt;</code>, but that didnt help - it's still centered above the entire table, not centered above the column split.</p>

<p>So, I'd appreciate any help getting the table to look 'right'. The only expected browser is apparently Firefox, versions 2 through 3.5 (although pushing 3.5 over 2 mostly). I apologise if I've missed any important information - please just ask and I'll add it.</p>

"3546140","<p>I have a form with two buttons. The first is hidden using Javascript.</p>

<p>I have solved this by submitting the form on an enter keydown Javascript event. However, this also submits the form if the user presses enter to select an item from the browser's autocomplete dropdown.</p>

<li>A bond has a length</li>

<li>It's a cyclic graph (for instance, the example in the question has a ring of alternating single and double bonds)</li>
<li>It's not a directed graph (if two atoms are bonded, it doesn't matter from which end you approach the bond)</li>

<p>Typically you'd store a graph as an array of nodes (atoms) and an array of edges (bonds). Nodes and edges would both be pointers to structs.</p>

<li>A pair of pointers to nodes</li>
<li>The type of bond (double/single)</li>
<li>The bond length and angle</li>

<p>Since it's not a directed graph, your data structure would consider an edge between A and B to be equivalent to an edge between B and A. That is, for a given pair of atoms, you'd expect your edge array to contain an edge from A to B and never from B to A.</p>

<p>I need to create a distribution (probably formatted as an image in the end) from a list of data.  </p>

<p>such that the data can be used to create a visual distribution.  I might, for example in this case, say that the ranges are in 10 and there needs to be at least 3 items in each range to be a valid point.</p>

<p>With this example data, I would expect the result to be analogous to </p>

<pre><code>ditribution = [1, 2, 4, 6]
</code></pre>

<p>since I have > 3 items in ranges 0-9, 10-19, 30-39 and 50-59.  Using that result I could generate an image that has the sections segmented out (darker color) that exist in my final distribution.  An example of the type of image I am trying to create can be seen below and would have been generated with far more data.  Ignore the blue line for now.</p>

<p>I know how to do this the <em>brute force</em> way of iterating over every item in the list and doing my calculation like that.  But, my data set may have hundreds of thousands, or even millions of numbers.  My range (10) and my required number of items (3) will likely be much larger in a real world example.</p>

","Python: create a distribution from a list based on number of items that fall within certain ranges","<python><distribution><poisson>","2010-08-23 17:55:48","26932","3550436","3","<p>If <code>data</code> is always sorted, a compact approach might be:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools as it

         ((k, len(list(g))) for k, g in it.groupby(data,key=lambda x:x//10))
     if L&gt;=3]
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>data</code> isn't sorted, or if you don't know, use <code>sorted(data)</code> as the first argument to <code>itertools.groupby</code>, instead of just <code>data</code>.</p>

<p>If you prefer a less dense/compact approach, you can of course expand this, e.g. to:</p>

<pre><code>def divby10(x): return x//10

distribution = []

    L = len(list(g))
    if L &lt; 3: continue

<p>In either case, the mechanism is that <code>groupby</code> first applies the callable passed as <code>key=</code> to each item in the iterable passed as its first argument, to obtain each item's""key""; for each consecutive group of items which have the same ""key"", <code>groupby</code> yields a tuple with two items: the value of the key, and an iterable over all items in said group.</p>

<p>Here, the key is obtained by dividing an item by 10 (with truncation); <code>len(list(g))</code> is the number of consecutive items with that ""key"".  Since the items must be consecutive, you need the data to be sorted (and, it's simpler to just sort it, than sort it ""by value divided by 10 with truncation"";-).</p>

  p &lt;- add_trace(p,
                 x = c(df$Start[i], df$Start[i] + df$Duration[i]), 
                 y = c(i, i), 
                 mode = ""lines"",

"3551052","<p>I'm working on a database for stat keeping for a sports club where I help administrate some events.  I think I've got the parts for keeping track of the competitor names, classifications, categories, etc. figured out using a main table, several lookup tables and a couple bridge tables to cover the many-to-many relationships involved.</p>

<p>I have a model sketched out for the next part, but I'm not entirely comfortable that I'm doing it right.  I know how we do it on paper and/or in a spreadsheet where I'm still doing a lot of manual work, but I'm not 100% confident I'm 'translating' it to tables and relations correctly.  </p>

<p>A simple event structure might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Tournament  
- Day 1  
    - Match 1 (Fired Match)  
    - Match 2 (Fired Match)  
    - Match 3 (Fired Match)  
  - Match 4 (Aggregate Match of 1,2,3)  

- Day 2  
    - Match 5 (Fired Match)  
    - Match 6 (Fired Match)  
    - Match 7 (Fired Match)  
  - Match 8 (Aggregate Match of 5,6,7)  

 - Match 9 (Aggregate Match of 4,8)  
</code></pre>

<p>I had broken things down a bit further and have tables for 'scores', 'stages', 'matches', and 'tournaments' (among others).  The idea being that scores are the raw data I need to record for each competitor, with foreign keys to the 'competitor' and 'stages' table.  Rather than having 'fired' and 'aggregate' matches, I decided to approach it as matches being aggregates of one or more stages, and tournaments can have one or more matches (aggregates).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/aZJnV.png"" alt=""ERD""></p>

<p>I left out some of the lookup tables indicated by the other foreign keys since they don't directly relate to the matter at hand which I guess is ""Is this the correct way to go about this, or would I be better off to skip the matches/stages separation?  Would there be a way to reimplement this parent-child relationship between matches and stages in a single table via a self-join? </p>
","Parent-child relationship: multiple tables vs. self-join","<sql><database><database-design><join><relationship>","2010-08-23 19:38:17","3027","3551388","1","<p>It looks like a properly normalized and flexible hierarchical structure to me.</p>

<p>As designed, it implies that a Tournament has one or more Matches, and a Match has one or more Stages... or, more to the point, each parent has a variable number of children, where the number is always greater than zero but can and will vary from instance to instance. If this is not the case, if a parent (Tournament or Match) will always have the same number of children, then there might be some minor advantage in denormalizing the data (like a table with seven columns for the weekdays) , but that may prove awkward in the long run.</p>

<p>I would definitely not do a single table with a self join, as the different levels of the hierarchy contain different attributes. For example, ""Shots"" is part of a Stage and not part of a Match, and so should not be made part of the Match table.</p>

<p>I am trying to accomplish this with CSS. Here is my markup:</p>

  &lt;img src=""B.gif"" alt=""B"" width=""30"" height=""30"" /&gt;
  18 pt; vertically centered;
&lt;/h2&gt;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are 30x30 pixel images.</li>
<li>Small red lines are 5 pixels paddings/margins (whichever works)</li>
<li>As a result of the images' height and vertical padding, the outermost container has a height of 40px (30+5+5).</li>
<li>The width of the outermost container is 100%.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is no chance the 18pt text will overflow the width of the container. Assume it will always be one line.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If more markup would help get the desired view, the markup can be modified.</p>

"3551631","<p>I will try my best to be both succinct and fully explanatory in this predicament.</p>

<p>On a site I manage, we allow a manager to view their ""Recruiting Downline"" which entails a list of all agents they personally recruited, as well as the recruits that particular agent (and so on and so on) brought to the Team. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>I recruit two Agents, A and B.</li>
<li>A recruits two agents, C and D.</li>
<li>B recruits two agents, E and F.</li>
<li>D recruits two agents G and H.</li>
<li>C, E, and F do nothing.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/xAL2q.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>In the database, every individual agent record has a field for 'referring agent', which lists their recruited agent.</p>

<ul>
<li>As the top level, when I click ""My
Recruits"", I am shown a list of all
sub agents (because they ALL fall
under my umbrella).</li>
<li>A is able to view C, D, G, and H.</li>
<li>B is only able to view E and F as
they are his only downline recruits
and they have brought nobody on
board.</li>
</ul>

<p>While this functionality works great it is flawed for two reasons:</p>

<p>Because of the way our PHP scripts are built, we are unable to sort the commission level data as a whole. Example: Even as the top man and I can see everybody, sorting by 'commission level' sorts my immediate agents by the criteria, then their downline as an item, then continues the sort based on my criteria. This is difficult to understand so to demonstrate, assume the table below displays the 'commission level' for ALL agents:</p>

<ul>
<li>A, 7</li>
<li>B, 6</li>
<li>C, 5</li>
<li>D, 6</li>
<li>E, 5</li>
<li>F, 2</li>
<li>G, 5</li>
<li>H, 1</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: an agent can NEVER recruit another agent at a higher level than they sit but they can recruit at ANY level below them (e.g. a 7 can recruit at 1,2,3,4,5,6 while a 3 can only recruit a 1,2).</p>

<h2>FROM MY (high level) perspective,</h2>

<p>While it would make sense for the data to be 'sorted by commission level' as:
A, D, B, G, C, E, F, H - this is not the case. </p>

<p>Instead (view from top agent's perspective mind you) is:
A, D, G, H, C, B, E, F</p>

<p>basically, every while loop depends on the DIRECT upline agent number to determine who falls next in line.</p>

<p>I understand this is 'very' difficult to understand but let me know if I can provide any additional understanding into our current 'sort' issue.</p>

<p>There might be more optimized versions out there, so might be worth digging more.</p>

<p>The following method determines the distance between two CGPoints.</p>

<pre><code>- (CGFloat)distanceBetweenPoint:(CGPoint)a andPoint:(CGPoint)b

    CGFloat a2 = powf(a.x-b.x, 2.f);
    CGFloat b2 = powf(a.y-b.y, 2.f);
    return sqrtf(a2 + b2)

"3552162","<p>Short question:  Given a point P and a line segment L, how do I find the point (or points) on L that are exactly X distance from P, if it guaranteed that there is such a point?</p>

<p>The longer way to ask this question is with an image.  Given two circles, one static and one dynamic, if you move the dynamic one towards the static one in a straight line, it's pretty easy to determine the point of contact (see 1, the green dot).</p>

<p>Now, if you move the dynamic circle towards the static circle at an angle, determining the point of contact is much more difficult, (see 2, the purple dot).  That part I already have done.  What I want to do is, after determining the point of contact, decrease the angle and determine the new point of contact (see 3, 4, the red dot).</p>

<p>In #4, you can see the angle is decreased by less than half, and the new point of contact is half-way between the straight-line point and the original point.  In #7, you can see the angle is bisected, but the new point of contact moves much farther than half way back towards the straight-line point.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/PByim.gif"" alt=""Example""></p>

<p>In my case, I always want to decrease the angle to 5/6ths its original value, but the original angle and distance between the circles are variable.  The circles are all the same radius.  The actual data I need after decreasing the angle is the vector between the new center of the dynamic circle and the static circle, that is, the blue line in 3, 4, 6, and 7, if that makes the calculation any easier.</p>

<p>So far, I know I have to move the dynamic circle along the line that the purple circle is a center of, towards the center of the static circle.  Then the circle has to move directly back towards the original position of the dynamic circle.  The hard part is knowing exactly how far back it has to move so that it's just touching the other circle.</p>
","Rotate a circle around another circle","<language-agnostic><math><trigonometry>","2010-08-23 22:21:51","1423","3552287","3","<p>To answer your short question, if you are on the Cartesian plane, then find the equation of the line L is sitting on (given the two endpoints of L, this is simple). Find the equation of the perpendicular to said line, which passes through P (this is done by taking the negative inverse of the slope, plugging in P's x and y values, and solving for the intercept). Then find the point where the two perpendicular lines intersect by using their equations as a single system of equations (with x's and y's equal). Then find the distance between the point of intersection and the point P, which is one leg of a triangle. Finally, with that distance and the distance X you are given, use Pythagorean theorem to find the distance of the other leg of the triangle. Now the point you are looking for is a point on L, and also on the line on which L sits. So using the distance you just obtained, the intersection point you had found before, and the equation of L's line, you can find the desired point's coordinates. There can only be a maximum of 2 such points, so all you have to test for is whether the coordinates of the points found are actually on L, or beyond L but still on its line. Sorry for the long answer and if you wanted a geometric explanation rather than an algebraic one.</p>

<p>It is filled with folders and their subfolders. For Example when the root folder has 2 subfolders and they have 2 subfolders it will look like this <img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ALClD.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>When i now add files or folders through some methods i want to add the new filenames or Ordner objects to my collection. How can i find the position where the SelectedItem from the TreeView is? 
Im Buffering the SelectedItem from the TreeView <code>selectedOrdner = (Ordner)DokumentBrowser.SelectedItem;</code> every time when it changed and add to this item the new filenames or Ordner Objects. 
How can I now throw the new Item to the right position in my list ? or update the old with the new values.</p>

<p>Do I always have to go recursive through my list to find the Object where im momentarily? or exists there a better and easier way?</p>

<p>--- edit</p>

<p>changed my Ordner Class implemented an observable collection und save the Object that is the root node of the nodes that it holds so i can remove them. its maybe not the best solution but it works fine for me</p>

<p>If you're trying to add siblings of the selected item and have them appear in the tree view, you can try looking at different data structures for them, which would make ordered insertion very easy and fast, such as LinkedList. On the other hand, I also suggest you use ObservableCollection to hold items, since it will automatically reflect the changes in the user interface. You can also insert items at a specific index in the ObservableCollection, so I can't imagine what the problem would be.</p>

"3556561","<p>is there any documentation available to build Flot graph similar to what we can find in the Stack Overflow <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/341106?tab=reputationhistory#tab-top"">profile/reputation</a> tab? </p>

<p>from the source code I can see that data is queried at this address: <code>/users/rep-graph/341106/"" + ranges.xaxis.from.toFixed(1) + ""/"" + ranges.xaxis.to.toFixed(1)</code> but I don't know the values <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> fields <strong>in the URL</strong> can accept.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/1XKUw.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>In this graph, we can see that two points are highlighted, and the result is that two <em>question</em> are listed on the side, which means that the plotted values are linked with <em>user-defined data</em>.</p>

<p>However, if I consider pkh's example, only the <em>points</em> (and a label) are provided to Flot:</p>

<pre><code>label: ""United States"",
        data: [[1990, 18.9], [1991, 18.7] ....
</code></pre>

<p>So I'd like to see:</p>

<li>how to update a panel according to graph selection [but maybe this part is not actually done by Flot itself]</li>

<p>So on the backend side, they must be doing something like this (pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>//get parameters from URL, non-rails people would just use POST or GET variables
$from = $_GET['from']
$to = $_GET['to']

//convert to timestamps in your language
$from = $from/1000
$to = $to/1000

//query your data source with these time-based restrictions
//return a JSON data set with the given restrictions, linking the known timestamps to labels
</code></pre>

<p>For your 2nd question, have your server-side return an associative array, linking the timestamp to a data object, which in this case contains Gain,Loss,Url,Title.  In the success callback, you display them.  Here's an example data object:</p>

<pre><code>{ 1274774400000 : {
       Gain:0,
       Loss:10,
       Url:'http://asdf.com',
       Title:'We lost some rep here... boohoo'
    },

       Loss:0,
       Url:'http://asdf.com',
       Title:'We gained some rep here... woo!'
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can see this type of object being used in the <code>showReputation</code> function in the page you referenced... except they returned a JSON array instead of an object.</p>

<p>Another feature you could easily add given the above data object:  a plotclick event that highlights the given data point when the click it.</p>

"3557310","<p>The task is relatively straightforward:</p>

<p>A Drupal website displays a list of articles with thumbnails. Some visitors would like to view it without images by clicking on a button/link and have that preference saved.</p>

<p>e.g. <a href=""http://patterntap.com/collections/index/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://patterntap.com/collections/index/</a></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/1mosX.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The problem is all visitors are anonymous and given certain traffic, page cache is enabled.</p>

<p>My idea was to use some simple JavaScript to set a cookie, refresh the page and depending on the cookie values (or its presence/absence) display or hide the images.</p>

<p>Except Drupal serves cached pages quite early and the only quick way to modify the cached version that I could find is by hacking includes/bootstrap.inc and add a custom class to the body classes then hide the images with css.</p>

<p>A very wrong approach, I know. But I wonder if there is a way to save different versions of a page and serve the correct version?</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<ul>
<li>need to keep the same uri</li>
<li>the js to show/hide the images without reload and set the cookie is already in place</li>
<li><code>hook_boot()</code> is not really called for cached pages, so can't do it via custom module</li>
<li>.htaccess mods?</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit/solution:
In the end went with Rimian's suggestion. But it is possible to accomplish the task using our own cache.inc implementation as seen in the <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/mobile_tools"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mobile Tools</a> module. Specifically, by extending cache.inc and updating settings.php to include</p>

<p>Why don't you write some jQuery or javascript and load that into your cached page with all the rest of the document? </p>

<p>Then, the client/browser would decide to run your script and hide images depending on some parameters you passed along with the request to that page or in the cookie? The script gets cached and only runs when you call it.</p>

<p>If you were hacking the bootstrap for something like that you'd really need to be rethinking what you were doing. Crazy! :)</p>

<pre><code>strcat(filename, "".txt""); 
</code></pre>

<p>In C++, single quotes indicate a <em>single</em> character, double quotes indicate a <em>sequence</em> of characters (a string). Appending an <code>L</code> before the literal indicates that it uses the wide character set:</p>

<pre><code>"".txt""  // &lt;--- ordinary string literal, type ""array of const chars""
L"".txt"" // &lt;--- wide string literal, type ""array of const wchar_ts""
'a'     // &lt;--- single ordinary character, type ""char""
L'a'    // &lt;--- single wide character, type ""wchar_t""

<p>The ordinary string literal is usually ASCII, while the wide string literal is usually some form of Unicode encoding (although the C++ language doesn't guarantee this - check your compiler documentation).</p>

<p>The compiler warning mentions <code>int</code> because the C++ standard (2.13.2/1) says that character literals that contain more than one <code>char</code> actually has type <code>int</code>, which has an implementation defined value.</p>

The catch however is that I always want the button to show and the list view to just occupy the space between the favorites text and the button.  The text is from the background image so I can't just align below that.  So even with 100 items I would still like to show the button.</p>

<p>What can I do. I broke my head and searched for an property of an handle offset, or any way to define for him that my handle is outside of your scope.</p>

I think to put a bullet image bg, and this way to give the LI more space to its left.

Since my list was vertical like yours, I ripped out the checks for the horizontal position so that it only checks the vertical position. That way it doesn't matter where the cursor is horizontally.</p>

<p>Just put this after your main jquery.ui.js include and before your sortable code to overwrite the method:</p>

<pre><code>// UI Fix for draggable
$.extend($['ui']['sortable'].prototype, {
    _intersectsWithPointer: function(item) {

        var isOverElementHeight = $.ui.isOverAxis(this.positionAbs.top + this.offset.click.top, item.top, item.height),
            verticalDirection = this._getDragVerticalDirection(),
            horizontalDirection = this._getDragHorizontalDirection();

        if (!isOverElementHeight)
            return false;

        return this.floating ?
            ( ((horizontalDirection &amp;&amp; horizontalDirection == ""right"") || verticalDirection == ""down"") ? 2 : 1 )
            : ( verticalDirection &amp;&amp; (verticalDirection == ""down"" ? 2 : 1) );

    }
});

<p>Obviously this breaks functionality for horizontal sorting, so you'll only want to include it in your special case.</p>

<p>It produces precisely an animated line and you can just adjust the path to the edge of your view to create a border. For example:</p>

<p>Define a path by your view parameters / arbitrary shape:</p>

<pre><code>Path path = new Path();
path.addRect(view.getLeft(), view.getTop(), view.getRight(), view.getBottom(), Path.Direction.CW);
</code></pre>

<p>Then create a dashed PathEffect with:</p>

<pre><code>PathEffect pe = new DashPathEffect(new float[] {10, 5, 5, 5}, phase);
</code></pre>

<p>Then set the associate it with a Paint object and draw:</p>

<pre><code>mPaint.setPathEffect(pe);
canvas.drawPath(path, mPaint);
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: The animated effect comes from continuously changing the phase and redrawing. In the API demo it calls invalidate() in the onDraw() method (which triggers onDraw()...)</p>

<p>Works harmoniously with individually rounded corners: <code>border-radius: 0 5px 5px 5px</code></p>

<p>In that case, the top-left corner would be no border-radius, and the other corners (clockwise) would be at 5px each.</p>

<p>Then use <code>behavior:url(path_to/pie.htc);</code> in the same style.</p>

<p>Remember also that the path_to is relative to the document being viewed, not the CSS file that calls it.  Make sure to check that if it doesn't work right off the bat.</p>

<p><strong>Additional information:</strong></p>

<p>If sometimes your styling appears and vanishes, try giving your element a <code>position:relative</code> and a specified <code>z-index</code>.  The way CSS3 PIE works, it plays with the z-index and can make your styled gradients (and rounded corners, etc.) appear underneath the background if not specified, particularly if you use negative margins or something odd like that.</p>

  <p>Can I use code contract rewriting without installing VS on CI build
  server (TeamCity)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. Install CodeContracts on the build server. (If it refuses to install on a machine without Visual Studio, just copy the files listed below, and their dependencies, onto the build server.) Once installed, you'll find the CodeContract tools installed in %programfiles%\Microsoft\Contracts\Bin. In that directory, there are 4 executables you'll be interested in: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>ccrewrite.exe - The binary rewriter. This should be executed after compilation. It turns your contracts into runtime checks or whatever you specify you want them turned into.</p></li>
<li><p>ccrefgen.exe - This can generate contract reference assemblies alongside your assemblies. This is useful if you're shipping dlls to be consumed by other parties.</p></li>
<li><p>cccheck.exe - The static checker. On the build server, you'd run this tool over your assemblies containing contracts, and it will spit out warnings and messages as it encounters potential problems.</p></li>
<li><p>ccdocgen.exe - This generates XML documentation from the contracts in your code. You might want to use this if you're shipping dlls with contracts for consumption by other parties, or if you just need internal docs on your code.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any msbuild tasks to execute Contract checking?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. There are 2 MSBuild tasks shipping with CodeContracts: in the same CodeContracts installation directory, check out the MSBuild\[framework version] folder. In that directory, there are 2 files that should help you out: Microsoft.CodeContracts.targets and Microsoft.CodeContractAnalysis.targets. </p>

<p>According to the CodeContracts documentation,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An msbuild script extension Microsoft
  .Contract. targets contains the extra
  build actions for the runtime contract
  instrumentation and static verification
  steps. As a result of this approach,
  it is possible to use the same
  functionality when building from the
  command line with the msbuild command.
  Using msbuild on a project or solution
  that uses contracts enabled via the VS
  user interface will perform the same
  actions as the corresponding build
  under VS. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, it is possible and supported to integrate the tools into CI builds via the MSBuild targets.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you use Code Contract's validation with CI builds?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Assuming you mean static checking with warnings/messages, I've done this personally, but haven't done this on a big project.</p>

<p>I hope this helps!</p>

I believe the bug occurs because the item you are clicking is in both lists, and thus ambiguous. So, IE incorrectly decides to move what you are clicking, as well as any parents that are also sortable. The solution I found was to add a 'handle' definition to the shallow list (e.g. ""#experienciasProfissionais > li > ul""). This eliminates the ambiguity so that the thing being dragged can only refer to one sortable list.</p>

class Quote(models.Model):

    ## Human name for easy reference
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    items = models.ManyToManyField(Product, through='QuoteIncludes')

    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.name

class QuoteIncludes(models.Model):

    ## Attach foreign keys between a Quote and Product
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product)
    quote = models.ForeignKey(Quote)

    ## Additional fields when adding product to a Quote
    quantity = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    per_unit_cost = models.DecimalField(max_digits=15, decimal_places=2)

<p>What I would like to be able to do is create a Quote in the Admin interface such that when I've filled in both the quantity and the per_unit_price of a line item, it fills in the ""extended_price"" as a product of the two when I tab over. I think it requires adding some AJAX in there.</p>

<p>You can also see issues because an app may for example try to paste HTML, but not really be able to handle all HTML. Or the apps may be buggy, or may not agree on what a particular MIME type really means.</p>

<p>Almost all apps can both copy and paste plain text, of course, but beyond that it's touch and go. If you don't get what seems to make sense, you could file a bug vs. one of the apps.</p>

<p>You may notice that if you exit the app you're copying from, you can no longer paste. (Unless you're running a ""clipboard manager"" or something.) This is because no data actually leaves the source app until the destination app asks for a format to paste.
There are ""clipboard managers"" that ask for data immediately anytime you copy and store that data, so you can paste after the source app exits, but they have downsides (what if the data is huge, or is offered in 10 formats, etc.)</p>

<p>The following python code will show available formats for the currently-copied data, if you have pygtk installed. This app shows the ctrl+c copied data, not the middle-click easter egg. (See <a href=""http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/ClipboardsWiki"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/ClipboardsWiki</a>)</p>

"3571863","<p>Hi want to get a date list between start date and end date. For example start date is 27-08-2010 and end date is 31-08-2010. So the date list is 27-08-2010,30-08-2010 and 31-08-2010. 29-08-2010 and 30-08-2010 will be ignore because it is in the weekend. I attach the picture for more clearer explanation. How to achieve this using javascript or jquery? I only want to get the list of date, for the business day calculation already done.</p>

","How to get date between start date and end date? (excluding date on weekend)","<javascript><jquery>","2010-08-26 03:35:28","4533","3571935","1","<p>First of all, we can disable in the datepickers the holidays and the weekends, for that we'll be setting it like this in each datepicker component:</p>

<h2>Disable weekends and holidays from DatePicker</h2>

<pre><code>var disabledDays = [""10-22-2010"",""8-16-2010""];
$(""#startDate"").datepicker({
    constrainInput: true,
beforeShowDay: noWeekendsOrHolidays
});

function nationalDays(date) {
    var m = date.getMonth(), d = date.getDate(), y = date.getFullYear();
    for (i = 0; i &lt; disabledDays.length; i++) {
        if($.inArray((m+1) + '-' + d + '-' + y,disabledDays) != -1 || new Date() &gt; date) {
            return [false];
        }
    }
    return [true];
}
function noWeekendsOrHolidays(date) {
    var noWeekend = jQuery.datepicker.noWeekends(date);
    return noWeekend[0] ? nationalDays(date) : noWeekend;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we have the behavior to not let users select weekends or holidays as startdate or enddates we continue, calculating the total days between those dates:</p>

<h2>Calculate Business Dates between two dates</h2>

<p>as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3464268/find-day-difference-between-two-dates-excluding-weekend-days/3464346#3464346"">Find day difference between two dates (excluding weekend days)</a> we have this function to calculate business days between dates:</p>

<pre><code>function calcBusinessDays(dDate1, dDate2) { // input given as Date objects
    var iWeeks, iDateDiff, iAdjust = 0;
    if (dDate2 &lt; dDate1) return -1; // error code if dates transposed
    var iWeekday1 = dDate1.getDay(); // day of week
    var iWeekday2 = dDate2.getDay();
    iWeekday1 = (iWeekday1 == 0) ? 7 : iWeekday1; // change Sunday from 0 to 7
    iWeekday2 = (iWeekday2 == 0) ? 7 : iWeekday2;
    if ((iWeekday1 &gt; 5) &amp;&amp; (iWeekday2 &gt; 5)) iAdjust = 1; // adjustment if both days on weekend
    iWeekday1 = (iWeekday1 &gt; 5) ? 5 : iWeekday1; // only count weekdays
    iWeekday2 = (iWeekday2 &gt; 5) ? 5 : iWeekday2;

    // calculate differnece in weeks (1000mS * 60sec * 60min * 24hrs * 7 days = 604800000)
    iWeeks = Math.floor((dDate2.getTime() - dDate1.getTime()) / 604800000)

    if (iWeekday1 &lt;= iWeekday2) {
      iDateDiff = (iWeeks * 5) + (iWeekday2 - iWeekday1)
    } else {
      iDateDiff = ((iWeeks + 1) * 5) - (iWeekday1 - iWeekday2)
    }

    iDateDiff -= iAdjust // take into account both days on weekend

    return (iDateDiff + 1); // add 1 because dates are inclusive
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Count down Holidays</h2>

<p>I'm right now in a hurry, what you need to do now is <code>--iDateDiff</code> (just before the return) for every date in <code>disabledDays</code> that is between <code>dDate1</code> and <code>dDate2</code>.</p>

<p>How will you accomplish that?...  You will iterate over the <code>disabledDays</code> array and convert/<code>parse</code> it to the Date Object and evaluate like:</p>

<pre><code>var holiDay = Date.parse(iteratedDate);
if((holiDay &gt;= dDate1 &amp;&amp; holiDay &lt;= dDate2)) {
    --iDateDiff
}
</code></pre>

<p>I hope i've helped you...</p>

"3572468","<p>I really like Nokola's NavSeven Silverlight Bar.</p>

<p>You can take a look at it here: <a href=""http://www.nokola.com/sources/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.nokola.com/sources/</a></p>

<p>You can notice right away that the Navigation Bar stretches all the way to 100%  and icons are nicely aligned in the middle.</p>

<p>The navigation bar itself is 900px wide in Page.xaml.</p>

<p>I've got it to work on my website but for some reason I cannot stretch it to 100% like on Nokola's site.</p>

<p>Here's what happens: I set width to 100% but instead of stretching, it stays at 900px wide and fills everything else with Whitespace. That's another problem - no matter what I change the background color to, it is always white which looks bad on my grey background of the website. But that's not really the point, it still doesn't stretch like it is supposed to, like it is on Nokola's website.</p>

<p>Here's the code I use to include my Silverlight file:</p>

Hey all,</p>

<p>I am trying to accomplish something very simple yet getting an error and it's driving me nuts.</p>

<p>here is what I am doing:</p>

<p>Function 1: </p>

<pre><code>-(id)initWithText:(NSString *)text1 :(NSString *)text2 :(NSString *)text3 :(NSString *)text4 :(NSString *)text5

{
</code></pre>

<p>here I do the assignment. I have not initialized the NSString date, projectName, task, duration and comment, but I don't see that causing any trouble.</p>

<pre><code> date=text1;
 projectName=text2;
 task=text3;
 duration=text4;

 if ([text5 isEqualToString:@""Add Comment""]==TRUE || [text5 isEqualToString:@""""]==TRUE) 
 {
  comment=@""No Comment"";
 }    

 else {
  comment=text5;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>date, duration, task ,projectname, comment are all NSString type.</p>

<p>This function gets called in a different viewController using the statement:</p>

<p>Function1 Call:</p>

<pre><code>[self.summaryViewController initWithText:self.dateDisplay.text :self.projectNameDisplay.text:self.taskDisplay.text:self.durationDisplay.text:commentText.text];
</code></pre>

<p>where dateDisplay, projectNameDisplay, taskDisplay, durationDisplay are all UILabels and commentText is a UITextView</p>

<hr>

<p>now I try to save the values captured through the function into a database using another function.</p>

<p>Function2:</p>

<pre><code>-(void) insertValues:(NSString *)text1 :(NSString *)text2 :(NSString *)text3 :(NSString *)text4 :(NSString *)text5
{

 if([self openDB]==TRUE)

   {
    NSString *sql  = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""INSERT INTO mastertable(_date,_projectName,_task,_duration,_comment,_status) VALUES ('%@','%@','%@','%@','%@','Pending');"",text1, text2, text3, text4, text5];

    char *err;

    NSLog(sql);

  if(sqlite3_exec(database,[sql UTF8String], NULL, NULL, &amp;err) !=SQLITE_OK)
   {

    NSAssert(0, @""error inserting values into table"");
    sqlite3_close(database);
   }

   else
   {
    NSLog(@""Entry Made"");

                sqlite3_close(database);

   }


 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Function2 call:</p>

<pre><code>[master insertValues:date :projectName :task :duration :comment];
</code></pre>

<p>My insert into table query, when printed in NSLog, throws up this:</p>

<p>INSERT INTO mastertable(_date,_projectName,_task,_duration,_comment,_status) VALUES (' Aug 26, 2010',' Staffing',' Mentoring',' 01:01',</p>

<p>'( > )'</p>

<p>,'Pending');</p>

<p>I think it's because of the conversion of UITextView to NSString</p>

<p>Please help</p>

<p>I got rid of all the leaks but can any one please tell me how to check the object allocations instrument in iphone..Please see the below screenshot..My app gets crashed once it loads all the 4200 contacts and the contacts are never displayed on the table view..What might be the problem..I make sure that the place from which my contacts is saved to the database is leak free..In the below screenshot what exactly should I look for..is it the total allocation or living..please let me know guys..I am totally exhausted..thanks a lot for your time..

","Object allocations instrument on iphone","<iphone><objective-c><memory-management><soap><memory-leaks>","2010-08-26 15:30:44","306","3576834","2","<p>You should put the [string release]; lines inside the for(NSString * myStr in result.entry_list) loop. Each time you call alloc, there must be a corresponding release call.</p>

<p>A better way to do it is to use [NSString stringWithFormat:] instead of [[NSString alloc] initWithFormat:] so that you don't need to release them manually.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My app gets crashed once it loads all
  the 4200 contacts and the contacts are
  never displayed on the table viewnever displayed on the table view</p>
</blockquote>

<p>4200 contacts make your loop ""large and tight"". As suggested by taskinoor, you can create and drain an NSAutoreleasePool for every a few loops to reduce memory foot print. For example:</p>

<pre><code>int counter = 0;
NSAutoreleasePool *pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
for (...) {
    if (++counter == 100) {
        counter = 0;
        [pool release];
        pool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
    }
  //busy working...
}
[pool release];
</code></pre>

<p>Your app may also be terminated by iOS if it takes too long to respond to system events. This mechanism is know as watchdog timeout. In this case, you'll find the exception code 0x8badf00d in the crash report. You may want to break the work into smaller batches or use a secondary thread so that the main thread won't be busy for too long.</p>

"3577052","<p>Alright I'm a bit baffled by this one. Changing an unrelated int property on my ViewModel seems to be making my Model unserializable.</p>

<p>I have an object which tracks the best time to contact someone. It can be set to Anyday, Weekdays, Evenings, SpecificDays and to Anytime, Mornings, Afternoons, Evenings, and SpecificTimes. When the object is saved, it gets serialized and sent to a WCF server.</p>

<p>In essence, the object is a collection of 7 Days. Each Day contains an int for the day of week, a collection of TimeSpans which define good calling hours for that day, an a collection of boolean flags which define which ""shortcut"" groups of times were selected (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, etc).</p>

<p>I am using MVVM and have a VM to handle this class. The only property the VM contains other then the collection of days is an int value of which ""shortcut"" group for the weekdays are defined (Weekdays, Weekends etc). </p>

<p>Everything works absolutely fine until I set the ""shortcut"" group for Weekdays to ""SpecificDays"". Upon saving, I get an error trying to pass the object to the WCF server. The error says it cannot serialize a parameter with the inner exception shown below (keep in mind that WCF errors are very generic and often do not point to the problem at all). Here's a screenshot of what I'm trying to do:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/VfOl6.jpg"" alt=""Sample Image""></p>

<p>This doesn't make sense to me, because the ShortcutWeekday is not sent to the WCF server at all. The only thing that goes is the collection of Days. And another puzzling thing, clicking on the ""Specific Days"" radio button, then clicking back to another selection will make the WCF call fail as well. Also, if the problem was with my class itself, wouldn't it have failed saving anytime, not just for the Specific Days?? I double-checked the property values of the collection of Days using the example above, and the object properties are set exactly the same.</p>

<p>Inner Exception:</p>

<pre><code>""Type 'System.DelegateSerializationHolder+DelegateEntry' with data contract name 
'DelegateSerializationHolder.DelegateEntry:http://schemas.datacontract.org/2004/07/System' 
is not expected. Consider using a DataContractResolver or add any types not known 
statically to the list of known types - for example, by using the KnownTypeAttribute 
attribute or by adding them to the list of known types passed to DataContractSerializer.""
</code></pre>

<p>ViewModel properties:</p>

<pre><code>// Used to track which Radio Button is selected
private int _selectedWeekdayGroup = 0;

// Object holding the current BestContactTime
private BestContactTime _bestContactTime;

// Shortcut to multiple Days in BestContactTime
public int SelectedWeekdayGroup
{
    get { return _selectedWeekdayGroup; }
    set
    {
        //UpdateCallableDays(value); // This updates the BestContactTime.Days collection
        _selectedWeekdayGroup = value;
        //OnPropertyChanged(""SelectedTimesGroups""); // This property is just which set of ShortcutTimes are displayed in checkboxes 
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>BestContactTime:</p>

<pre><code>// Should always have only 7 objects, one per day of week
public ObservableCollection&lt;ContactDay&gt; Days;
</code></pre>

<p>Contact Day:</p>

<pre><code>public int WeekDay;
public SortableObservableCollection&lt;TimeSpan&gt; CallableTimes;
public SortableObservableCollection&lt;bool&gt; CallableTimeGroups;
</code></pre>

<p>SortableObservableCollection is just a class which inherits from ObservableCollection with some additional methods such as Sorting and AddRange.</p>

"3577454","<p>Has anybody been in or has seen a kind of ""Surgical Team"" as described in The Mythical Man Month? Have you heard of somebody actually implementing ""Mill's Proposal""?</p>

<p>There is a lot of detail about the various roles in the book itself, but for those who haven't read the book, I found a <a href=""http://www.dfpug.de/loseblattsammlung/online/workshop/design_patterns/sonstiges.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">website</a> and a <a href=""http://runtimelog.blogspot.com/2005/06/mythical-surgical-team_10.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">blog post</a> which give a good summary. I've quoted the roles from the website below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The Surgical Team</strong></p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p>The <strong>surgeon</strong> is the chief programmer and the el-presidente of the whole
  team. He produces all the
  specifications, codes the entire
  system the team is responsible for,
  tests it, and drafts its supporting
  documentation.</p></li>
  <li><p>The <strong>copilot</strong> is the surgeon‚Äôs assistant. His main purpose is to
  share in the thinking about design
  issues ‚Äì to serve as a sounding board,
  as it were. The copilot represents the
  team in meetings with other teams. He
  knows the code intimately, and serves
  as insurance in case of disaster to
  the surgeon.</p></li>
  <li><p>The <strong>toolsmith</strong> supports the surgeon and builds specialized utilities and
  tools as may be required by his
  surgeon. Each team has its dedicated
  toolsmith in addition to any central
  services provided by the rest of the
  project infrastructure. The tester is
  responsible for maintaining test cases
  for testing the surgeon‚Äôs work as he
  writes it. He is both an adversary who
  devises test cases to measure against
  the formal specs and devises test data
  to be used in debugging.</p></li>
  <li><p>The <strong>language lawyer</strong>, which can serve several surgeons, I a widely consulted
  specialist who delights in the mastery
  of the intricacies of the programming
  languages and the operating systems
  upon which the software must perform. </p></li>
  <li><p>The <strong>administrator</strong> handles money, people, space, and machines. The
  surgeon is the ultimate boss, with the
  last word on all these issues, but the
  day to day management of the issues
  and interfacing with the
  administrative machinery of the
  project is the role of a professional
  administrator. One administrator may
  serve more than one team.</p></li>
  <li><p>The <strong>editor</strong> edits and revises the documentation as drafted or dictated
  by the surgeon and oversees the
  mechanics of its production.</p></li>
  <li><p>The <strong>program clerk</strong>, trained as a secretary, is responsible for
  maintaining all the  machine-readable
  and human-readable technical records
  generated by the team. All the filing
  and indexing is the responsibility of
  the program clerk.</p></li>
  <li><p>The <strong>secretaries</strong> handle the project correspondence and non-project files.</p></li>

"3581108","<p>So I'm writing up a CV and I would like to use the nifty <code>itemize</code> environment to list some things within a <code>tabular</code> environment.  Unfortunately, things end up looking a bit 
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/TqN2h.jpg"" alt=""this"">, which isn't at all what I want.  Specifically, I want to the itemize environment to hug closely to ""BIG COMPANY NAME"" so that it appears as ""Software Development Intern"" does, and likewise at the bottom.  My current code looks a bit like so:</p>

<pre><code>\textsc{May 2010 to Aug 2010}
    &amp; Software Development Intern  \\
    &amp; \textsc{BIG COMPANY NAME} \\
    &amp; \begin{itemize}
        \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
        \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
        \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
        \setlength{\partopsep}{0pt}
        \setlength{\topsep}{0pt}
        \item item1
        \item item2
    \end{itemize} \\
    &amp; \small{Cool Details}\\
</code></pre>

<p>Buuut it's not doing the job at all.  Any suggestions, Latex gurus?</p>
","Lists in Tabular Environment","<latex><pdflatex>","2010-08-27 03:19:04","237","3582924","1","<p>You can use the package <code>paralist</code> which defines among others the <code>compactitem</code> environment (which is a compact itemize).

In your case I would just load</p>

","Placing and centering div inside a div","<javascript><jquery><css>","2010-08-27 07:41:37","465","3582543","3","<p>Unfortunatelly Kyle's answer will do nothing about centering the inner div vertically.</p>

<p>Liquid vertical alignment is close to impossible using CSS2.1. Given your constraints are there is a circle inside the outer div, that is as tall as the div itself, you'll need to use Javascript to calculate the absolute positioning and dimensions of the inner div that will fit in the circle.  Let's assume you give the outer's dimensions fully, and specify a given height for the inner div.</p>

<p>Markup</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""outer""&gt;  
 &lt;div id=""inner""&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>CSS</p>

<pre><code>#outer { 
  position: relative; 
  width: 100px; 
  height: 100px;
  backgroud-image: blah
}
#inner {
  position: absolute;
  height: 60px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Javascript (assuming JQuery)</p>

<pre><code>// prepare for semi-intense math
var radius = $('#outer').width()/2;
var height = $('#inner').height();
var d = Math.sqrt(radius*radius - height*height/4);

$('#inner').width(2*d)
    .css('top', (radius - height/2) + 'px')
    .css('left', (radius - d) + 'px');
</code></pre>

<h2>Edit: Explanation</h2>

<p>What we need is to calculate <code>inner.left</code> (call it <em>x</em>), <code>inner.top</code> (call it <em>y</em>) and <code>inner.width</code> (call it <em>w</em>). This is what this problem looks like, the values in red is what we are after:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/tT2Qr.png"" alt=""Circle maths""></p>

<p>To note, we have an origin (0,0) for the coordinates of all points. The circle has a radius equal to <code>outer.width/2</code> (since the circle is as high and long as this div). Thus in our coordinate system, the center, of both divs and the circle, is at (<em>r</em>, <em>r</em>) (<em>r</em> = radius).</p>

<p>First we can deduce the y coordinate from the diagram, because we know the height <em>h</em>.</p>

<pre><code>y = r - h/2
</code></pre>

<p>In the diagram, the point we're after lies on the circle, thus we use the equation for the circle and solve for <em>x</em>. So the equation for the circle given center at (<em>r</em>, <em>r</em>) and radius <em>r</em> (remembering high-school maths):</p>

<pre><code>(x - r)^2 + (y - r)^2 = r^2
(x - r)^2 + (r - h/2 - r)^2 = r^2   --- replacing y
x = r ¬± sqrt(r^2 - 1/4*h^2)         --- solving for x
</code></pre>

<p>This x is actually two different x's, one for each point at this y coordinate and depends on whether we take the + or - square root in the answer. The one we need is the lesser of the two. The width of the inner div is given by the difference between these two x's.</p>

<pre><code>w = r + sqrt(r^2 - 1/4*h^2) - [r - sqrt(r^2 - 1/4*h^2)]
w = 2*sqrt(r^2 - 1/4*h^2)

<p>You can also always raise the sizes to like 512, 256,266 and try again to be certain it's something else.</p>

<p>Also, Logcat output would be nice too.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>  As it seems, you <strong>cant</strong> just ""install"" the app on the SDcard even if you have 30+Gigabyte free on it. Installation depends also on the internal memory of the phone even in 2.2.</p>

<p>Example: Nexus one has 512mb internal memory. The android os takes the needed ram for the camera, gpu, kernel etc leaving a user with only around 190MB app space (which will be even lower due to apps already installed etc).</p>

<p>HTC Hero on the other hand has only 288mb internal memory, leaving it with a very small ""app size ram"".</p>

<p>Depending on the phone, 90mb app will install to SDcard on nexus one, but won't on Hero due to memory limitations.</p>

<p>The reason you are getting that error is that, after the android os takes the needed ram out of those 192MB, the ""app size ram"" is not enough to hold that 50+mb application.</p>

<p>I thought that installLocation would install directly to SD, but that is not the case.</p>

"3584329","<p>I am in my way of finishing the graphs for a paper and decided (<a href=""https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/2067/follow-up-in-a-mixed-within-between-anova-plot-estimated-ses-or-actual-ses"">after a discussion on stats.stackoverflow</a>), in order to transmit as much information as possible, to create the following graph that present both in the foreground the means and in the background the raw data:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/mLNqy.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>However, one problem remains and that is overplotting. For example, the marked point looks like it reflects one data point, but in fact 5 data points exists with the same value at that place.<br>
<strong>Therefore, I would like to know if there is a way to deal with overplotting in <code>base graph</code> using <code>points</code> as the function.</strong><br>
It would be ideal if e.g., the respective points get darker, or thicker or,...  </p>

<p>Manually doing it is not an option (too many graphs and points like this). Furthermore, <code>ggplot2</code> is also not what I want to learn to deal with this single problem (one reason is that I tend to like dual-axes what is not supprted in <code>ggplot2</code>).</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I wrote a function which automatically creates the above graphs and avoids overplotting by adding vertical or horizontal jitter (or both): <a href=""http://www.psychologie.uni-freiburg.de/Members/singmann/R/raw.means.plot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">check it out!</a></p>

"3585907","<p>I'm attempting to parse an Oracle trace file using regular expressions. My language of choice is C#, but I chose to use Ruby for this exercise to get some familiarity with it.</p>

<p>The log file is somewhat predictable. Most lines (99.8%, to be specific) match the following pattern:</p>

<pre><code># [Timestamp]                  [Thread]  [Event]   [Message]
# TIME:2010/08/25-12:00:01:945 TID: a2c  (VERSION) Managed Assembly version: 2.102.2.20

line_regex = /^TIME:(\S+)\s+TID:\s*(\S+)\s+(\S+)\s+(.*)$/
</code></pre>

<p>However, in a few places in the log there much are complicated queried that, for some reason, span several lines:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/5Xn4D.png"" alt=""Screenshot""></p>

<p>Two things to point out about these entries is that they appear to cause some sort of corruption in the log file, because they end with unprintable characters, and then suddenly the next entry begins on the same line.</p>

<p>Since this obviously rules out capturing data on a per-line basis, I think the next best option is to match everything between the word ""TIME:"" and either the next instance of ""TIME:"" or the end of the file. I'm not sure how to express this using regular expressions. </p>

<p>Is there a more efficient approach? The log file I need to parse will be over 1.5GB. My intention is to normalize the lines, and drop unnecessary lines, to eventually insert them as rows in a database for querying.</p>

"3586377","<p>I have the following situation between these three tables:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/D8IAJ.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Before I start explaining what I'm trying to accomplish here, let me clarify three things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I drew the model on EntityFramework, but this is actually the database view. Just assume that the fields type match between tables;</p></li>
<li><p>I know that this database model sucks. But changing it is out of question. I know that it would make my life easier.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm using Visual Studio 2008 and .Net 3.5 on this project. But I'm accepting solutions based on Visual Studio 2010 and .Net 4.0 as well.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So, as I tried to demonstrate on the picture above, in this project that I'm working on I got these 3 tables. One of then, <strong>TransactionLine</strong>, associates a file to a transaction line, that is part of a full transaction.</p>

<p>Now, what I'm trying to associate here is <strong>TransactionLine</strong> and <strong>File</strong>. However, <strong>TransactionLine</strong> doens't have <em>FileId</em> field from the <strong>File</strong> table. The fields <em>FileNumber</em> and <em>FileType</em> from this table stand for an composite key on <strong>File</strong>. And indeed, <strong>File</strong>'s <em>FileNumber</em> and <em>FileType</em> never repeat. They could be the primary key, but then again, I can't touch the database structure.</p>

<p>I try to associate <strong>TransactionLine</strong> and <strong>File</strong> by creanting an <em>Association</em> of One To Many From <strong>File</strong> to <strong>TransactionLine</strong>. After that, I select the <em>Association</em> and change to the <em>Mapping Details</em> screen, then I select <em>Map's to</em> <strong><em>TransactionLine</em></strong>.</p>

<p>The data that he askes me to fill on the model screen are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>File</strong>.<em>FileId</em>;</li>
<li><strong>TransactionLine</strong>.<em>TransactionId</em>;</li>
<li><strong>TransactionLine</strong>.<em>FileNumber</em>;</li>
<li><strong>TransactionLine</strong>.<em>FileType</em>,</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the <strong>TransactionLine</strong> scalar properties are set by theirs corresponding database fields, which are of the same name. But when I'm going to specify the linkage with <strong>File</strong> table, the only scalar field that I can specify there is <em>FileId</em>, which I don't have on the <strong>TransactionLine</strong> table.</p>

<p>I also tried to set <strong>File</strong>'s <em>FileNumber</em> and <em>FileType</em> scalar properties entity key flag to true, and <em>FileId</em> entity flag to false, but with no success, since the program warns me that database <em>FileId</em> is a primary key but is not set like one on the entity.</p>

<p>Is it possible to link <strong>TransactionLine</strong> <em>FileNumber</em> and <em>FileType</em> with <strong>File</strong>? Is there any workaround for this situation?</p>

<p>Special Note: <em>FileId</em> is indeed the primary key for <strong>File</strong>. Others tables link with it by this field. The <strong>TransactionLine</strong> here is an exception to the common sense rule. :(</p>

<p>Here is what we did:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/f5yOi.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<ol>
<li><p>We created a view, named VIEWFILEEXTRA, with just the fields we‚Äôd like to use in the association;</p></li>
<li><p>After that, we created an entity based on this view, named FileExtra;</p></li>
<li><p>Map FileExtra to VIEWFILEEXTRA, if not done yet;</p></li>
<li><p>Change FileNumber and FileType from FileExtra Entity Key flag to true;</p></li>
<li><p>Delete FileNumber and FileType scalar properties from File;</p></li>
<li><p>Create an 1 on 1 association between file and FileExtra;</p></li>
<li><p>Set the scalar properties in the association mapping to point to File‚Äôs database fields FileNumber and FileType;</p></li>
<li><p>Create an 1 to Many association between FileExtra and TransactionLine;</p></li>
<li><p>Point the association mapping to TransactionLine, and set the fields.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And that‚Äôs it. Thank you very much for your attention and tips :D.</p>

Since a manager is an employee, there is no reason the managers shouldn't be stored in the Employees table. Simply add a field to the Employees table called <code>manager_id</code>, which for any given row references that employee's manager (which is another row from the same table).</p>

<p>This is called a recursive one-to-one relationship, and it is quite common. In your case, it will also prevent you from having to define duplicate fields across the two entities (names, passwords, job titles, etc).</p>

<p>The top half will be a gradient that has full flexible to skew left, right, up, down without much distortion. The bottom half is an image that is ideally made for the 1280 x 1024 resolution (as this is the most popular browser display resolution). Then depending on the requirements needed it will sketch and skew to whatever size it needs. Still allowing all of the image to be seen.</p>

<p>The ration between the top half and bottom half is always 50% 50% independent of browser resolution. </p>

<p>I would also like if both the top and bottom parts are fixed.</p>

<p>In a perfect world (one without IE), id like to do this with css3 gradients and multiple backgrounds in 1 DIV. However, because IE9 isnt out yet, I think the best way to approach it would be 2 divs in a DIV container and using a PNG repeating background for the top div.</p>

<p>It looks good in 1280 x 1024...now its just getting the whole resizing of the top DIV to be 50% so the image is 50%.</p>

<p>I'd still like ALL of the water to be seen, because I like the look of the rocks at the bottom. However, I am open to alternative ideas that don't accomplish what I want 100%, but come close.</p>

I have a table with an image in each row (at the beginning).
Each image has tooltip (title attibute). HTML looks lie this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;td align=""center""&gt; 
&lt;input type=""hidden"" value=""0"" /&gt;
&lt;img src=""/img/prognosis/2green.png"" title=""Augsburg-G√∂ggingen ""&gt;   
&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>To make the table sortable I  added a hidden input with a value, that is the criteria for sorting.</p>

<p>Everything looks fine until I delete the .png file.
Then it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Bl6bU.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The grey rectangle's width is dependant on the tooltip's length.
How can this happen? 
Any help appreciated! THX!</p>

<p>Here is a helper C-function to create a such a path:</p>

<pre><code>// Note: caller is responsible for releasing the returned path

    // Make points for the corners
    CGFloat inset = strokeWidth/2; // because the stroke is centered on the path.
    CGPoint tlc = CGPointMake(CGRectGetMinX(rect) + inset,
                              CGRectGetMinY(rect) + inset);

    CGPoint brc = CGPointMake(CGRectGetMaxX(rect) - inset,
                              CGRectGetMaxY(rect) - inset);

    // Start in top left and move around counter-clockwise.
    CGPathMoveToPoint(p, NULL, tlc.x, tlc.y+cornerSize.height);

    // Create the path, add it to the context, and stroke it.
    CGPathRef path = createAngledCornerRectPath(rect,

<p>The issue was due to my table inheritance and the configuration at the database level.

<p>When using Hibernate, you'll probably create a domain model of entities and do some domain modeling but you aren't necessarily following <em>Domain-Driven Design</em> principles, there is no direct implication. And actually, I'm tempted to say that it's most often the contrary, most Hibernate applications end up having an <a href=""http://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/AnemicDomainModel.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">anemic domain model</a>.</p>

<p>No. there is no particular knowledge to have to write Entities. However, if you want to follow DDD, you obviously need to have some knowledge of  DDD. And if you want to go this direction, using Hibernate (as your factory for entities) has some implications on the implementation. <a href=""http://www.jblewitt.com/blog/?p=129"" rel=""noreferrer"">Domain-Driven Design with Spring and Hibernate</a> is a very nice blog post on the topic and describes an AOP based approach.</p>

This is an in class example that is not going to be graded it is just to familiarize us with getting our designs to a working program.  here's what I have so far mind you this is a simple console program.</p>

<p>In that case:</p>

<pre><code>public static class CheckDigit
{
    public static bool CheckIsbn(string isbn)
    { 
       //implementation as in your question.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now write a new application (here it's a console app) that uses both of your classes.</p>

<pre><code>class MyConsoleApp
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        //create a new instance of the ISBN/book class. you're prompted as part
        //of the constructor.
        isbn myFavoriteBook = new isbn();

        //new class contains the method for checking validity 
        bool isValid = CheckDigit.CheckIsbn(myFavoriteBook.GetIsbn());

        //write out the results of the validity.
        Console.WriteLine(string.Format(""Your book {0} a valid ISBN"",

        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here's what's happening:</p>

<ul>
<li>we create a new instance of isbn/book. Its constructor has the Console.Readline command to ask the user for input. It then stores the user's entry into <code>this.isbnNum</code>.</li>
<li>our new static class <code>CheckDigit</code> is simply a validator of any given string. It determines whether the argument sent is a valid ISBN number. It'll return a bool. We sent it the <code>isbn.GetIsbn()</code>, which is what the user entered.</li>
<li>the bool returned from the <code>CheckIsbn()</code> is displayed nicely in a sentence for the user in the console.</li>
</ul>

<p>So really there are 2 main classes - <code>isbn</code> and the <code>CheckDigit</code>. The other <code>Main(string[] args)</code> can be removed from your code.</p>

<p>Here's the <a href=""http://pastebin.com/9VeGvshU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">entire console app in one file</a>. Paste into your application, and you can see what's happening.</p>

<p>Is that the help you were looking for? Either way, leave a comment, and we can get it sorted out for you.</p>

<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>CheckIsbn</code> really only does 1 thing - returns whether the 9th character is an X or some other number. It doesn't modify the ISBN from the user, as it stands today. If you wanted to maintain that formatting (removing dashes, spaces), and otherwise modify the input ISBN, then you could specify the ISBN as an <code>out</code> parameter.</li>
</ul>

<p>Redefine your method like this if you want the ISBN entered by the user, to retain any changes made within the method <code>CheckIsbn</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public static bool CheckIsbn(out string isbn)

","CSS border on a <div> acts differently?","<html><css>","2010-08-29 15:01:26","1646","3595237","1","<p>This happens because box sizing is different between form elements and normal HTML elements. If it's not a form element, the box model used is the one W3C used to preach where border and padding <strong>add</strong> to the set <code>width</code> property to make it larger than you specified.</p>

<p>If you don't care about legacy browser support (IE &lt; 8, etc), you can just do this:</p>

<pre><code>div.style {
    /* By default, browsers would have set this as content-box */
    box-sizing: border-box;
    -moz-box-sizing: border-box;

<p>And your border (and any existing horizontal padding) will be part of the <code>width</code> property of your <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p>

toaddr = string.splitfields(raw_input(""To: ""), ',')
print ""Enter message, end with ^D:""

    msg = msg + line

# The actual mail send
server = smtplib.SMTP('localhost')
server.sendmail(fromaddr, toaddrs, msg)
server.quit()
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>but I hardly understand how I could have this script run from ""Google App Engine"":  </p>

<p><strong>1)</strong> Firstly, I don't quite understand what e-mail address I need to place right after <strong><em>From:</em></strong> in this line:</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>fromaddr = raw_input(""From: "")
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Can I just place here any e-mail address of any e-mail boxes that I have?</p>

<p><strong>2)</strong> Secondly, let's say I want to send a message to this e-mail address of mine <em>brilliant@yahoo.com</em> . Then the next line, I guess, must look this way:</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>toaddr = string.splitfields(raw_input(""To: brilliant@yahoo.com""), ',')
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Is this right?</p>

<p><strong>3)</strong> Thirdly, let's say, the message that I want to send will be this sentence: <em>Cats cannot fly!</em> Then, I guess, the line that starts with <strong><em>msg =</em></strong> must look this way:</p>

<hr>

<pre><code>msg = 'Cats cannot fly!'
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Is this correct?</p>

<p><strong>4)</strong> If I upload this script as an application to ""GAE"", how often will it be sending this message to my mail box? Will it send this message to me only once or it will be sending it to me every second all the time until I delete the application? (This is why I haven't tried uploading this script so far)</p>

"
"3596163","<p>I've been wondering this for a while already. The title stands for my question. What do you prefer?</p>

<p>I made a pic to make my question clearer.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/r8I3d.png"" alt=""Single or multiple tables?""></p>

<p>Why am I even thinking of this? Isn't one table the most obvious option? Well, kind of. It's the simpliest way, but let's think more practical. When there is a ton of data in one table and user wants to only see statistics about browsers the visitors use, this may not be as successful. Taking browser-data out of one table is naturally better.</p>

<p>Multiple tables has disadvantages too. Writing data takes more time and resources. With one table there's only one mysql-query needed.</p>

<p>Anyway, I figured out a solution, which I think makes sense. Data is written to some kind of temporary table. All of those lines will be exported to multiple tables later (scheduled script). This way the system doesn't take loading-time from the users page, but the data remains fast to browse.</p>

<p>Let's bring some discussion here.  I'm hoping to raise some opinions.</p>

<p><strong>how do i get all the feeds.description from the company that my company ( example here is cid = 1 ) ?</strong></p>

this will display

this should be displaying like
hello ive updated a product
hello ive updated a product im from company 2
hello ive i got a shoutout im company 3
hello ive updated my second product

<p>or simpler get feeds.description from each follow.following ( cid = 1,2,3,etc ) from me. ( cid = 1)
or if twitter get all my friends status ( friends that i follow )</p>

<p>some good guys at irc mysql said to use joins. but i just dont get it.
what i get is this</p>

<pre><code>fetch all the follow.following from cid = me ( example cid = 1 )

<p>then</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM feeds WHERE feeds.cid = IN (2,3,cid that im following ( see follow.following ))

","What did Git do to my source code?","<git>","2010-08-29 23:31:18","396","3597107","3","<p>Your problem is that you have pushed a commit to your remote repository, then amended it locally, made another commit and then pulled.</p>

<p>Because the remote repository contains an old 'version' of your amended commit, your new local commit is not a direct descendant of the remote branch. This means that pull will trigger a non-trivial (i.e. non fast forward) merge of the two branches. The old commit on the remote side and the amended commit that you have locally affect change the same areas of the same files so you have conflicts.</p>

<p>Assuming that you haven't (or don't mean to have) any local changes and that you want your most recent real commit (""Bug Hunting for Media Support"") to be the head of the master branch you can undo the merge attempt like this.</p>

<p>I'm not 100% sure of you diagram, I believe that it means that you are attempting a merge but that you haven't made the merge commit yet. If so run this (be warned, this throws away local changes):</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard
</code></pre>

<p>If you have committed the merge (i.e. ""-"" is actually the commit message) then you would have to run <code>git reset --hard HEAD^</code> instead.</p>

<p>After this your local master should be at the old commit.</p>

<p>If this is successdul, in order to get your remote repository correct, you will need to <em>force</em> the push. (This is usually <em>not</em> recommended but as you say that you are the only person using your repository it's OK.)</p>

<p>You should try this:</p>

<pre><code>git push -f origin master

<p>If this doesn't work (e.g. if the remote has <code>denyNonFastForward</code> set) you will have to resort to alternative means. See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1270514/undoing-a-git-push/1270608#1270608"">here</a> for details of how to get around this.</p>

<p>Recommend you set up some ajax listener page and ping with some userID and vote (1,-1) or something along those lines.</p>

<p>This assumes you have a userID and login credentials etc. Or you can register it against their IP or something.</p>

<p>Basically:</p>

<p>ajaxListener.php?ID=123456&amp;vote=1</p>

<p>send the ajax listener, and then have the total vote count update when the ajax is complete (have your ajax listener echo back a string of data lets say):
voteTotal=10~totalVote=95</p>

<p>Once you read this with ajax, split it with javascript:
var split1=responseText.split(""~"");
var voteScore=split1[0];
var voteCount=split1[1];</p>

<p>not tested but this should work and complete what you are thinking.</p>

"3601434","<p>I have a 3D plot like this:</p>

<p>On the y-axis of the plot, each group of three bars refers to the same parameters: x1, x2, x3. I would like to have a spacing on the y-axis for each group of three bars, so that it becomes more clear that those bars are referring to the same parameters. At the same time, I would like to put a label on the y-axis for each group of three bars. For example, the following label layout for the y-axis would be desired:</p>

<pre><code>x1 x2 x3   x1 x2 x3   x1 x2 x3
  grid1     grid2      grid3

<p>Note that you may have to adjust the x and y values of your text objects to get them to render where you want for the given camera view that you choose.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>If you'd also like to display the values above each bar, you can do that by adding the following to the above code:</p>

<pre><code>hText = text(kron((1:c).', ones(r, 1)), ...    %' Column of x values
             repmat(Y(:), c, 1), ...            % Column of y values
             Z(:)+0.05, ...                     % Column of z values
             num2str(Z(:)), ...                 % Text strings
             'HorizontalAlignment', 'center');  % Center the strings
</code></pre>

<p>It should be pointed out that having this much plotted text gets a little messy, since some of the text will be overlapping or hidden behind the bars. The text is also a bit redundant, since the <em>color</em> of the bars is really meant to show the values.</p>

"3601867","<p>Been stuck on this for days, things just aren't working with how I'm setting this up. I have a large grid of ImageViews which are all the same size. It's made up of a Horizontal LinearLayout and within that, 5 Vertical LinearLayouts (first picture). </p>

<p>What I want (and I don't care how, be it using RelativeLayout, Linear or Tables) is if I were to set say Image #2 to a larger image (specifically 3x3 of the smaller ones) I want it to effectively 'overwrite' those images (as shown in picture 2).</p>

<p>I've tried doing this by setting the 'overwritten' images (3,4,7,8,9,12,13,14) to setVisibility(GONE) which works fine but then the second vertical LinearLayout has expanded to fit the size of the new image which I don't want. If I try setting it to fill_parent though it squashes the size of the image. As a result, what I get is the third picture.</p>

<p>If I were to do this using RelativeLayouts, I run into problems when I setVisibility(GONE) since the position may very well be referenced using a missing View. Setting it to INVISIBLE just leaves a blank space, when what I really want is effectively it to be of 0px by 0px in size.</p>

<p>Any help at all would be appreciated; it seems no matter what I try something always goes slightly wrong with it, and it's driving me insane.</p>

<p>So if you want to put something on #2 like my example, change layout_alignLeft and layout_alignTop on id gs01 to be @id/a_t2, and it will work. This gets around the issue with putting setVisibility(GONE) which deletes the 'anchor' point used to calculate the position of the grid spaces.</p>

<p>In short, no it's not the same. The Icon File setting is the pre-iOS4 setting, but you should keep this for iOS3 compatibility if you allow your app to install on iOS3. The Icon File setting should point to the 57x57 sized icon.</p>

<p>iOS4 uses the Icon Files setting, which is actually an array containing all filenames of all the icons. It scans through all the specified icons and uses the one with the closest matching size for the job. You should add your high resolution icon to this list as well as the standard 57x57 icon.</p>

<p>For some of my company's software I would like to provide exception reporting GUIs if (and ultimately when) my application fails unexpectedly. Building the GUI is not hard. It boils down to this: <strong><em>Are there any existing solutions for the backend systems in exception reporting?</em></strong> Ideally I am looking for a java library and a corresponding server backend. I could roll my own solution; for example, I could send the data to a webserver via POST data. </p>

<p>I feel like a solution for this already exists somewhere -- I just haven't run into it. Any recommendations?</p>

<p>Any ideas what could be wrong with the data that is causing AS3 to choke?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I've tried to insert the same data into a binary type field using SQLite Manager 3.5 for OS X with the same result. I'm working with a JPG, going to try other image formats, though I can't begin to guess which supplied index is out of bounds given that trying to jump to the definition just states that it's getting it from a SWC and I can't see. Grasping at straws before I distribute the data in a zip and decompress it on the fly, which I don't want to do.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2, Workaround Edition:</strong> For now, I've written a quick MXML Window that prompts for the images and inserts the data into the database. Would still love to know why another application can't store BLOB data in a way that SQLStatement understands. I'm essentially setting up a few buttons that prompt for file paths to the images I want in the database, reading them in with readBytes() to a ByteArray, and storing that into the SQLite db using SQLStatement. I am then able to read the image back without difficulty.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> Here is an image of the table structure. Note, this same table is being used successfully when I have Flash do the database image insert, as opposed to some other tool which properly stores the data in the BLOB field for every other application but Flash...</p>

<p>So I'm experimenting with interface building with MonoDevelop (version 2.4). I'm trying to get used to the Gtk concept of ""containers within containers"". I created a vbox with two... er... boxes, put a menu on the top box, and a table on the bottom one. I set the table to have two column and five rows. On the top four rows, I put a label in the left and an entry in the right. On the bottom right cell I put a button. It looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/RjowD.png"" alt=""GUIBlah Application""></p>

<p>Here's the things I'm struggling with:</p>

<p>1) How do I get the table's columns NOT to be of equal width? Amusingly, when I added just the labels, and hadn't added the entry boxes yet, the left column used up only the space needed for the labels. Now it's 50/50 and it won't budge.</p>

<p>2) How do I get the labels to be right-aligned, so the final "":"" in their texts gets nicely aligned and close to the entry boxes? I set the ""Justify"" property of the labels to ""Right"" and was seemingly ignored.</p>

<p>3) The action code for the ""Open"" and ""Close"" actions under the ""File"" menu consist on displaying a modal message box with an OK button. But pressing the OK button doesn't dismiss the message box, only closing the message box window does. The code is:</p>

<pre><code>(new Gtk.MessageDialog(this, DialogFlags.Modal, MessageType.Info, ButtonsType.Ok,
                  ""Open Action"")).Show();

<p>2) Set the label's Xalign property to 1.0. Justify controls layout of wrapped text, Xalign/Yalign controls the position of the whole block within the label's area.</p>

<p>3) You should Destroy() the dialog after you're done with it. Alternatively you can Hide() it and re-use it. You should also look into using the dialog's Run() method - typically something like:</p>

<pre><code>var dialog = new FooDialog(...);
try {
    dialog.Show();
    var response = (ResponseType) dialog.Run ();
    if (response == ResponseType.Ok) {
        //do stuff

"3606043","<p>Greetings all,</p>

<p>I use MinGW,QT and CMake for my project.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/liJ9t.png"" alt=""http://i34.tinypic.com/30w85xt.png""></p>

<p>As shown in the figure, my project has two modules.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>libRinzoCore.DLL - a shared library which define some abstract classes and interfaces and some core functionality of the application.This module is used to implement dynamic Plugins (which are also shared libraries which automatically loaded by the application) .</p></li>
<li><p>Rinzo.exe - the main application.This uses ""libRinzoCore"" classes.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>""libRinzoCore"" mainly developed using QT objects and link against the QT library.</p>

<p>""Rinzo.exe"" also uses QT library objects,some are not being used in ""libRinzoCore"".So I have to link QT Library and ""libRinzoCore"" with this executable.</p>

<p>I can compile ""libRinzoCore"" without problems and it generated two files ""libRinzoCore.DLL"" and ""libRinzoCore.DLL.a""</p>

<p>But during compiling ""Rinzo.exe"" it gives the following output :</p>

<p>And when executing ""Rinzo.exe"" it crashes with the message (this is a translation from Japanese error message)</p>

"3606864","<p>I want to be able to have a JPanel in a cell with a JButton that does some work when clicked.</p>

<p>I looked for howtos about Cell Editors, but all examples talk about replacing the cell with another component (e.g. replace an int with a JTextField etc.) My situation is a little different:</p>

<p>I have the following ADT </p>

<pre><code>class MyClass {

<p>As you can see, the JPanel contains a button. I want this button to launch a JFrame whenever clicked. Any ideas?</p>

<p>If you will suggest Cell Editor, please be a little more specific about how to do so. If possible, provide some pseudo-code.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>P.S. I'm pretty sure the title of this question needs some work. ;)</p>
","JTable: Buttons in Custom Panel in Cell","<java><jtable><jpanel><jbutton>","2010-08-31 07:23:08","7003","3607421","3","<p>After <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3606864/jtable-buttons-in-custom-panel-in-cell/3606915#3606915"">coding.mof's reply</a>, I finally did what I wanted. However, I wanted a more complete answer for this question, so I will provide one myself.</p>

<p>So, Cell Renderers simply draw the component and do not allow any interactions within it. While Cell Editors do. </p>

<p>Initially, all cells in the JTable are components that are returned by the registered renderer. However, when a cell is selected, this component is replaced by a component that is returned by the editor. These two can actually be different components! Which I'm pretty sure you can take advantage of this and make some funky cells :P </p>

<p>Anyway, in this example, both the renderer and the editor display the same component, so we will create a component that will be used by both.</p>

<p>First, we need to create a TableModel that returns our ADT:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClassTableModel extends DefaultTableModel {
  List&lt;MyClass&gt; data;

  public MyClassTableModel(List&lt;MyClass&gt; data) {
    this.data = data;
  }

  public Class&lt;?&gt; getColumnClass(int columnIndex) { return MyClass.class; }
  public int getColumnCount() { return 1; }
  public String getColumnName(int columnIndex) { return ""MyClass""; }
  public int getRowCount() { return (data == null) ? 0 : data.size(); }
  public Object getValueAt(int rowIndex, int columnIndex) { return data.get(rowIndex); }
  public boolean isCellEditable(int rowIndex, int columnIndex) { return true; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we create a component that will be shared between the Renderer and the Editor:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClassCellComponent extends JPanel() {
  MyClass myClass;

  public MyClassCellComponent() {
    // initialize components (labels, buttons, etc.)
    // add action listeners
  }

  public void updateData(MyClass myClass, boolean isSelected, JTable table) {
    this.myClass = myClass;
    // update buttons, labels etc. accordingly
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The isSelected and table parameters are used to render the background of the panel and are optional. Here is how the renderer uses our component:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClassCellRenderer implements TableCellRenderer {
  MyClassCellComponent panel;

  public MyClassCellRenderer() {
    panel = new MyClassCellComponent();
  }

  public Component getTableCellRendererComponent(JTable table, Object value,        boolean isSelected, boolean hasFocus, int row, int column) {
    MyClass myClass = (MyClass)value;
    panel.updateData(myClass, isSelected, table);
    return panel;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is how the editor uses it:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClassCellEditor extends AbstractCellEditor {
  MyClassCellComponent panel;
  public MyClassCellEditor() {
    panel = new MyClassCellComponent();
  }
  public Component getTableCellEditorComponent(JTable table, Object value,      boolean isSelected, int row, int column) {
    MyClass myClass = (MyClass)value;
    panel.updateData(myClass, true, table);
    return panel;
  }
  public Object getCellEditorValue() {
    return null;
  }
}
</code></pre>

"3607718","<p>In VIM I've got 4 windows opened and a NERD tree like this:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/WI4wh.png"" alt=""screenshot"">
So, whenever I try to open the file from NERD, it's opened in first buffer (topleft pos). Sometimes in other buffers.
Is there a way to open a file in bottom right position ? Mb there are workarounds ?
Maybe I can force NERDtree to open file in last active window ? At the moment, it doesn't work this way :(</p>

<p>UPD: It looks like the problem is in hidden buffers.
When the buffer was opened in one window, and then replaced by another - if you try to open the very first in another window, you'll get it opened in the window it was opened in the very first time.</p>

"3607784","<p>I am storing transactions in a table. These transactions have an ID which relates to their parent node in a hierarchy tree. An example of my tree is shown in the image below. I need to allow an end user to retrieve the transaction and group them however they want as they are then written to a file based on the grouping. In the image below the devices (IM001-1 etc) create the transactions. In the live version the tree will be a lot larger and could have further levels for town and smaller regions etc. Now to the problem. Let‚Äôs say that a user wants all the transactions from the ‚ÄúUK‚Äù devices and they want them grouped by the country node (so ‚ÄúUK_North‚Äù and ‚ÄúUK_South‚Äù). The result should be a grouped list which in this example would contain two items. The first item would contain all the transactions from devices ‚ÄúIM001-1‚Äù and ‚ÄúIM001-2‚Äù and the second item would have the transactions for devices ‚ÄúIM002-1‚Äù and ‚ÄúIM002-2‚Äù. What I have done so far is to get a list of device for each parent node. So I have a grouped list where each item contains Ids of all its child devices. What I‚Äôd like to do is use Linq to look at all my transactions with their ID‚Äôs and create a grouped list where the grouping checks to see which parent owns it. This all sounds rather complex so if it‚Äôs not clear I can provide additional details if required. Am I approaching this problem the right way ? As there could be a lot of transactions I didn‚Äôt want to have to do a lot of tree navigation for every transaction because of the performance hit.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/EB89g.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The transactions are held in a list of transaction:</p>

<pre><code> List&lt;Transaction&gt; transactions
</code></pre>

<p>There is a property on each transaction that exposes its ‚ÄúDeviceId‚Äù</p>

<p>I then have a grouped list which is defined as the following when I hover the mouse over the ‚Äúvar‚Äù:</p>

<pre><code> IEnumerable&lt;IGrouping&lt;String,Device&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This list is called ‚ÄúgroupedDevices‚Äù. Each item in the list represents a parent node (for example UK_North) which contains a list of all the available devices under that node. Each device has a ‚ÄúDeviceId‚Äù property.</p>

<p>What the Linq statement needs to do is look at the transactions list and see which parent it belongs to by using the ‚ÄúgroupedDevices‚Äù list and then grouping by that.</p>

"3613491","<p>I'm trying to embed a browser control in my application (IWebBrowser2). I need to implement IDispatch, IDocHostShowUI, IDocHostUIHandler etc to make this work. I am doing this in pure C++/Win32 api. I'm not using ATL, MFC or any other framework.</p>
<p>I have a main class, called TWebf, that creates a Win32 window to put the browser control in and makes all the OLE calls needed to make it work. It's also used for controlling the browser control, with methods like Refresh(), Back(), Forward() etc.</p>
<p>Right now this is implemented with composition. TWebf has classes implementing all the different interfaces (IDispatch, IDocHostShowUI...) as (stack allocated) members. First thing TWebf does in its constructor is give all those members a pointer back to itself (<code>dispatch.webf = this;</code> etc). QueryInterface, AddRef and Release are implemented as calls to those methods in TWebf for all interface implementations (by calling <code>return webf-&gt;QueryInterface(riid, ppv);</code> for example)</p>
<p>I don't like this circular dependency between TWebf and the classes implementing the interfaces. TWebf has a TDispatch member that has a TWebf member that has a...</p>
<p>So I was thinking about solving this with multiple inheritance instead. That would also simplify QueryInterface to always be able to just return <code>this</code>.</p>

<p>As can be seen in the uml I want to provide bare-minimum implementations of all the interfaces so I only have to override those methods in the interfaces I actually want to do something substantial in TWebf.</p>
<p>Is my &quot;multiple inheritance implementation&quot; possible? Is it a good idea? Is it the best solution?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>For future discussion, here's the current implementation of QueryInterface in TWebf</p>
<pre><code>HRESULT STDMETHODCALLTYPE TWebf::QueryInterface(REFIID riid, void **ppv)
{
    *ppv = NULL;

    if (riid == IID_IUnknown) {
        *ppv = this;
    } else if (riid == IID_IOleClientSite) {
        *ppv = &amp;clientsite;
    } else if (riid == IID_IOleWindow || riid == IID_IOleInPlaceSite) {
        *ppv = &amp;site;

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>
<p>I tried implementing this for just a couple of the interfaces. Having TWebf inherit from IUnknown and TOleClientSite seems to work fine, but when I added TDispatch to the inheritance list it stopped working.</p>
<p>Apart from the <code>warning C4584: 'TWebf' : base-class 'IUnknown' is already a base-class of 'TDispatch'</code> warning I also get runtime errors. The runtime error is &quot;Access violation reading location 0x00000000&quot;</p>
<p>The runtime error happens on a line dealing with IOleClientSite, not IDispatch for some reason. I don't know why this is happening, or if it really has to do with the multiple inheritance or not. Any clues anyone?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong></p>
<p>A bad implementation of QueryInterface seems to have been the reason for the runtime exception. As <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/5987/mark-ransom"">Mark Ransom</a> correctly noted the this pointer needs to be casted before it's assigned to *ppv, and special care is needed when IUnknown is requested. Read <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1742848/why-exactly-do-i-need-an-explicit-upcast-when-implementing-queryinterface-in-a"">Why exactly do I need an explicit upcast when implementing QueryInterface in an object with multiple inheritance</a> for an excellent explanation of that.</p>

<p>However QueryInterface must still cast the pointer for each interface. One interesting property of multiple inheritance is that the pointer may get adjusted for each class type - a pointer to IDispatch won't have the same value as a pointer to IDocHostUIHandler, even though they both point to the same object. Also make sure that a QueryInterface for IUnknown always returns the same pointer; since all the interfaces derive from IUnknown you'll get an ambiguous cast if you try just to cast directly to it, but that also means you can use any interface as an IUnknown, just pick the first one in the parent list.</p>

"3616646","<p>For a simple project of mine, a release build in Visual Studio produces an assembly of size 18,944 bytes. But if I build the same solution from the command line with MSBuild, I get an assembly of size 28,672 bytes. That's a difference of 9,728 bytes.</p>

<p>I am invoking MSBuild with:</p>

<pre><code>msbuild /p:Configuration=Release /t:Rebuild MySolution.sln
</code></pre>

<p>In ILDasm, I saw only minor differences in metadata. Dumping and comparing the tree view shows no differences. Dumping and comparing headers yielded a clue:</p>

<pre><code>Visual Studio Output                             MSBuild Output
// Size of init.data:              0x00000800    // Size of init.data:              0x00002000
// Size of headers:                0x00000200    // Size of headers:                0x00001000
// File alignment:                 0x00000200    // File alignment:                 0x00001000
</code></pre>

<p>The difference in init data size is 0x1800, or 6,144 bytes. The difference in header size is 0xE00, or 3,584 bytes. The sum of these two differences is 9,728 bytes, which accounts for the discrepancy. The difference in file alignment is 3,584 bytes.</p>

<p>Further down I see:</p>

<pre><code>Visual Studio Output                                    MSBuild Output
// File size            : 18944                         // File size            : 28672
// PE header size       : 512 (496 used)    ( 2.70%)    // PE header size       : 4096 (496 used)    (14.29%)
// Data                 : 2048              (10.81%)    // Data                 : 8192              (28.57%)
</code></pre>

<p>So obviously this all comes down to file alignments. But why do file alignments differ when building from the command line? In the advanced settings inside Visual Studio, I see that the file alignment is indeed set to 512:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/mlrBR.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>This property is manifested in the project file in a <code>PropertyGroup</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;PropertyGroup Condition="" '$(Configuration)|$(Platform)' == 'Release|AnyCPU' ""&gt;
    ...
    &lt;FileAlignment&gt;512&lt;/FileAlignment&gt;
&lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But notice the combination of <code>$Configuration</code> and <code>$Platform</code>? On a hunch, I tried this from the command line:</p>

<pre><code>msbuild /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=""Any CPU"" /t:Rebuild MySolution.sln
</code></pre>

<p>And then the output matched (in size) perfectly!</p>

<p>This is the only property group for a release configuration, so it is obviously being used by MSBuild regardless of whether the platform is specified. To prove this, I changed the <code>OutputPath</code> in this property group and then built with MSBuild at the command line. Sure enough, it picked up the new output directory.</p>

<p>I tried changing the alignment of 512 to 1024 and then built at the command line. It used it!</p>

The project file had been upgraded from VS2008 to VS2010 (and I think VS2005 to VS2008 before that) so I'm assuming something got broken along the way.</p>

<p>So, for now at least, I'm putting this down to a combination of broken upgrades and me confusing myself whilst writing the question. I still can't quite explain the behavior I was seeing (as per my post) but things seem to have righted themselves since the <code>FileAlignment</code> was explicitly added.</p>

it might look a bit 'cluttered' but at least it's usable. If someone needs to fill in these forms 5 times a day i think he'll start to get bored of the cycling quite fast.</p>

<p>another important point is this: in test 2 you have no default value, which is good. because is someone forgets 1 line you can do form validation for that. with the cycling thing, the default value already will be one of the answers, making it more easy to make errors on input.</p>

"3616950","<p>Im writing a compiler for university project, and I would like to transform my Abstract Syntax Tree into a Control Flow Graph(CFG).</p>

<p>Im thinking that the nodes(<code>V</code>) in the CFG should be nodes from the AST. I know algorithmically how to construct the edge set (<code>G=(V,E)</code>) but Im having a hard time writing the process a bit more formally</p>

<p>I've created this scala style pattern matching (Pseudo):</p>

<pre><code>def edges(n:Node)(nestedin_next: Node) : List[(Node,Node)] = 
    n match {
       case (c_1 :: c_2::tl) =&gt; (c1,c2) :: edges(c2::tl)(nestedin_next)++
                                   edges(c_1)(c_2)//recurse
       case c_1 :: Nil =&gt; (c_1,nestedin_next)::Nil
       case  i@ IF(_,c1,c2) =&gt; (i,c1)::(i,c2)::edges(c1)(nestedin_next)++
                                edges(c2)(nestedin_next)
       case _ =&gt; Nil
     }
</code></pre>

<p>Which should match an AST structure like:</p>

<pre><code>( IF(1,
       ASSIGN(x,1), // ia1
       ASSIGN(x,2) // ia2
     ) ::  // i1
  ASSIGN(y,2) ::  // a1
  ASSIGN(z,ADD(x,y)) :: //a2 
  IF(z, 
       RET(z), //i2r1
         assign(z,0):: // i2a1
         ret(z) // i2r2
  ) :://i2
   Nil
)
</code></pre>

<p>and provide an edgeset like:</p>

<pre><code>{ i1 -&gt; ia1,
   i1 -&gt; ia2,
   ia1 -&gt; a1,
   ia2 -&gt; a1,
   a1 -&gt; a2,
   a2 -&gt; i2,
   i2 -&gt; i2r1
   i2-&gt; i2a1
   i2a1 -&gt; i2r2
   i2r2 -&gt; _|_
   i2r1 -&gt; _|_ 
}
</code></pre>

<a href=""http://s3.blog.vrist.dk.s3.amazonaws.com/cfgsv1.dot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DotSrc</a></p>

<p>Anyone got any hints on how to do this a bit more formally than scala ""pseudocode""?</p>

<p>Im thinking something inductive like:</p>

<pre><code>e[[ IF(_,b1,b2) ]] = (if -&gt; b1) + (if -&gt; b2) \cup e[[ b1 ]] \cup e[[ b2 ]]
e[[ b1, b2 ]] = e[[b1]] \cup e[[b2]]
</code></pre>

<p>(the above would only give a tree and not a graph though. No edge from edge of then-branch to next statement for example)</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>I've been reading up on <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/kiama/wiki/Dataflow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">kiama and dataflows</a> for scala, and I like the ""succ"" and ""following"" approach they use. Nevertheless, I'm having a hard time boiling that down into a more formal description, mostly because of the nifty <code>childAttr</code>, <code>s.next</code> which hides some of the details that turns ugly when I try to specify it formally.</p>

<p>EDIT2: </p>

<p>I've been through the Dragon Book and ""Modern Compiler Implementation in ML"" as well as some of the other material from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1669/learning-to-write-a-compiler"">Learning to write a compiler</a> and some/most mentions data flow and control flow, but never touches much upon HOW to create the CFG in any formal way.</p>

<p>EDIT3:</p>

<p>Via <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/kiama/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Kiama</a> author, <a href=""http://plrg.science.mq.edu.au/wiki/plrg/TonySloane"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Associate Professor Dr. Tony Sloane</a> I recieved some <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/kiama/msg/5750da532f440ed5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">additional book references to look up</a>.</p>

<p>As far as I can see the ""way to do it"" as per those books is based on a ""per statement"" of the program more than over the AST and is based on Basic Blocks. Great input nevertheless!</p>
","Formally constructing Control Flow Graph","<language-agnostic><compiler-construction><scala><compiler-theory>","2010-09-01 10:11:06","3387","3642918","2","<p>If your intention is to simply create something that looks a bit more formal, then you could express these matching operations as inference rules using the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_inference"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">standard notation</a>.  You should express it in terms of a single step of reduction, rather than recursively, because then it is sufficient to simply keep applying these rules until no more can be applied.</p>

<p>That said, this definition is essentially going to say exactly the same thing as your scala code.  If you really want to do anything ""formal"" the properties you need to prove are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your CFG translation algorithm always terminates</li>
<li>Whether your CFG is minimal with respect to a given AST input</li>
<li>Whether there is a unique CFG derivable by your algorithm for a given AST input (i.e. it's not non-deterministic which CFG it produces).</li>
</ul>

<p>I don't think your basic blocks approach (rather than a per-statement approach) is necessarily a bad idea, either.  It seems perfectly reasonable that if you can match a basic block, you can write a rule that makes assertions about set membership based upon the presence of this match.  It seems like the inductive definition you started sketching could work just fine.</p>

<p>Something else interesting might be to try to relate (formally) <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_semantics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">structured operational semantics</a> and your construction of CFGs.  There might already be work in this area, but I only did a cursory google search and didn't find any clearly stated relationship between the two, but intuitively it seems like one should exist.</p>

<p>Sample B: Added a subchild div, with a height of 30px.  As expected, it changes the height of the parent, thus revealing the black background beneath ""content of child b"" </p>

<p>Sample C: The subchild is repositions with position:relative.  Note how even though this element is shifted above everything, it still contributes to the height of the parent, thus keeping the black background revealed</p>

<p>Sample D: Problem in sample C excacerbated by added a span before subchild div.</p>

<p>The behavior in A and B I understand.  What I do not understand is the behavior in C and D.  If the element that makes the parent taller is repositioned such that it isn't in that space anymore ... why does it still make the parent taller?</p>

<p>I expect (incorrectly, obviously), that example C (and D) would look identical to A, with the addition of the green ""subchild"" box above it.</p>

<p>I want to create a bar chart where the x-axis is the number of stars and the height of each bar is the number of ratings with that star.</p>

<p>If I do</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(d, aes(rating)) + geom_bar()
</code></pre>

<p>this works fine, except that the bars aren't centered over each rating and the width of each bar isn't ideal.</p>

<p>If I do</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(d, aes(factor(rating))) + geom_bar()
</code></pre>

<p>the order of the number of stars gets messed up on the x-axis. (On my Mac, at least; for some reason, the default ordering works on a Windows machine.) Here's what it looks like:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Bi9za.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I tried</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(d, aes(factor(rating, ordered=T, levels=-3:3))) + geom_bar()
</code></pre>

<p>but this doesn't seem to help.</p>

<p>How can I get my bar chart to look like the above picture, but with the correct ordering on the x-axis?</p>
","ordered factors in ggplot2 bar chart","<r><ggplot2>","2010-09-01 21:52:26","3763","3625421","1","<p>I'm not sure your sample data frame is representative of the images you put up. You mentioned  your ratings are on a 1-5 scale, but your images show a -3 to 3 scale. With that said, I think this should get you going in the right direction:</p>

<p>Sample data:</p>

<pre><code>d = data.frame(judge=sample(c(""alice"",""bob"",""tony""), 100, replace = TRUE)
    , movie=sample(c(""toy story"", ""inception"", ""a league of their own""), 100, replace = TRUE)
    , rating =  sample(1:5, 100, replace = TRUE))
</code></pre>

<p>You were closest with this:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(d, aes(rating)) + geom_bar()
</code></pre>

<p>and by adjusting the default binwidth in <code>geom_bar</code> we can make the bar widths more appropriate and treating rating as a factor centers them over the label:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(d, aes(x = factor(rating))) + geom_bar(binwidth = 1)
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/dSe9Q.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>If you wanted to incorporate one of the other variables in the chart such as the movie, you can use fill:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(d, aes(x = factor(rating), fill = factor(movie))) + geom_bar(binwidth = 1)
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/NF8JG.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>It may make more sense to put the movies on the x axis and fill with the rating if you have a small number of movies to compare:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(d, aes(x = factor(movie), fill = factor(rating))) + geom_bar(binwidth = 1)
</code></pre>

<p>If this doesn't get you on your way, put up a more representative example of your dataset. I wasn't able to recreate the ordering problems, but that could be due to a difference in the sample data you posted and the data you are analyzing. </p>

Just walking the polygon won't work for concave polygons, as in your diagram. Below is a sketch of my algorithm, inspired by the <a href=""http://www.inf.usi.ch/hormann/papers/Greiner.1998.ECO.pdf"">Greiner-Hormann</a> polygon clipping algorithm. Splitting is both easier and harder than polygon clipping. Easier because you only clip against a line instead of a rect or another polygon; harder because you need to keep both sides.</p>

<pre><code>Create an empty list of output polygons
Create an empty list of pending crossbacks (one for each polygon)
Find all intersections between the polygon and the line.
Sort them by position along the line.
Pair them up as alternating entry/exit lines.
Append a polygon to the output list and make it current.
Walk the polygon. For each edge:
    Append the first point to the current polygon.
    If there is an intersection with the split line:
        Add the intersection point to the current polygon.
        Find the intersection point in the intersection pairs.
        Set its partner as the crossback point for the current polygon.
        If there is an existing polygon with a crossback for this edge:
            Set the current polygon to be that polygon.
        Else
            Append a new polygon and new crossback point to the output lists and make it current.

<p>I've got an array with <em>first</em> XML element - STRUCTURE. </p>

<p>Array<br />
--STRUCTURE<br />
     ----PAGE<br />
     ----PAGE<br />
       -- -- --PAGE<br />
     ----PAGE<br /></p>

<p>So the main question is how make array looks like this:</p>

<p>Array<br />
     ----PAGE<br />
     ----PAGE<br />
       -- -- --PAGE<br />
     ----PAGE<br /></p>

<p>How to do it better friends - i don't need to include ""structure"" into array, is it possible to create by DOM functions ?!</p>
","PHP DOM array - cut the first element - better way to do it","<php><arrays><dom>","2010-09-02 08:39:47","482","3625724","1","<p>Basically you just want to exclude the <code>structure</code> level from the created PHP array?</p>

<p>I guess, you do something like this right now:</p>

<pre><code>$dom = new DOMDocument();
$dom-&gt;loadXML($xml);
$array = dom2array($dom);
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting array includes the <code>structure</code> key.</p>

<p>What you can do is start from the structure element like so:</p>

<pre><code>...
$array = dom2array($dom-&gt;getElementsByTagName('structure')-&gt;item(0));
</code></pre>

<p>Or you leave it as is and do it this way using the array key:</p>

<pre><code>$array = dom2array($dom);
$array = $array['structure']; // set $array to the subelements of ""structure""

This way all you pass to the view is the model. Neither the View nor the ViewModel should need any repository. The way it works is the controller uses a repository to fetch the model and pass this model to the view:</p>

<pre><code>public ViewResult Create()
{
    string username = User.Identity.Name;
    Problem model = someRepository.FetchModel(username);
    ProblemViewModel viewModel = someMapper.ConvertToViewModel(model);

    return View(""Edit"", viewModel);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And the submit action:</p>

    // inputs in the View

<p>For those unaware, the tweet button is a simple bit of JS which you can drop in to a page and it allows your users to easily tweet about the page in question, much like the facebok &quot;share&quot; button.</p>

<p>The horizontal count button is the one I'd like to put on my pages. My problem is that roughly half of my pages are likely to have a zero count, and I'd rather not show the count when this is the case. The facebook share button, for example, handles this particular situation well - if there are &gt; 0 shares, then it shows the count. Otherwise the count stays hidden.</p>
<p>I've gone through the twitter docs, and can't seem to find a way of specifying this in the JS parameters.</p>
<p>I also spent some time trying to capture the count via jquery and hide it, but quickly ran in to cross-domain permission issues -</p>

<p>returns a <code>Permission denied</code> error due to the iframe being loaded from <code>platform0.twitter.com</code>.</p>

","How can I show a textbox on my BlackBerry application?","<blackberry><textbox>","2010-09-02 13:42:06","745","3628256","1","<p>You should implement your own class, inherited from TextBox and override <strong>void paint(Graphics g)</strong> method.</p>

<p>Smth, like that, sorry i write from mobile:</p>

<pre><code>public void paint(Graphics g)

In OS 4.6+ you can use <a href=""http://www.blackberry.com/developers/docs/5.0.0api/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Border and BorderFactory</a> classes (search in All Classes list).</p>

<pre><code>// Each integer represents the amount of space between the box and border

// Create border and background objects

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/sMqZO.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I was wondering if there exists a MATLAB function to do such a plot?</p>
","How can I reproduce this cuboid plot in MATLAB?","<matlab><3d><plot>","2010-09-02 13:43:28","1672","3629433","1","<p>It's not clear what format your video frames are in to start with, so I'll assume they're loaded into MATLAB as a structure array of movie frames (as described <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/getframe.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>). I'll create some sample movie data (a single image repeated 200 times) to first show you how you can load the first frame into an image as well as create an image out of the top and side edges of all your frames (to use as the top and side faces of the cuboid):</p>

<pre><code>M = repmat(im2frame(imread('peppers.png')),1,200);  %# Sample movie data

nFrames = numel(M);                  %# The number of frames
face1 = frame2im(M(1));              %# Get the image for the front face
[R,C,D] = size(face1);               %# Get the dimensions of the image
face2 = zeros(R,nFrames,3,'uint8');  %# Initialize the image for the side face
face3 = zeros(nFrames,C,3,'uint8');  %# Initialize the image for the top face

for k = 1:nFrames               %# Loop over the frames
  img = frame2im(M(k));         %# Get the image for the current frame
  face2(:,k,:) = img(:,end,:);  %# Copy the side edge to the side face image
  face3(k,:,:) = img(1,:,:);    %# Copy the top edge to the top face image
end
</code></pre>

<p>The above code assumes that the movie frames are <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/creating_plots/f2-10709.html#f2-12468"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RGB images</a> as opposed to <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/creating_plots/f2-10709.html#f2-155"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">indexed images</a>. If they are indexed images you will have to get the additional colormap argument from the function <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/frame2im.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FRAME2IM</a> and then use that to convert the image to an RGB image using the function <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/techdoc/ref/ind2rgb.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IND2RGB</a>.</p>

<p>Next, you can plot each side of the cube as a texture-mapped surface using the <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/access/helpdesk/help/techdoc/ref/surf.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SURF</a> function:</p>

<pre><code>offset = nFrames/sqrt(2);          %# The offset in pixels between the back

surf([0 C; 0 C],...                %# Plot the front face
     [R R; 0 0],...
     [0 0; 0 0],...
     'FaceColor','texturemap',...
     'CData',face1);
hold on;                           %# Add to the existing plot
surf([C C+offset; C C+offset],...  %# Plot the side face
     [R R+offset; 0 offset],...
     [0 0; 0 0],...
     'FaceColor','texturemap',...
     'CData',face2);
surf([0 C; offset C+offset],...    %# Plot the top face
     [R R; R+offset R+offset],...
     [0 0; 0 0],...
     'FaceColor','texturemap',...
     'CData',face3);
axis equal                    %# Make the scale on the x and y axes equal
view(2);                      %# Change the camera view
axis off                      %# Turn off display of the axes
set(gcf,'Color','w'...        %# Scale the figure up
    'Position',[50 50 C+offset+20 R+offset+20]);

"3627683","<p>As a pet project, I've been playing with the concept of integrating Aero Glass effects into my SWT application. <a href=""http://www.milewski.ws/2009/02/vista-glass-in-swt-application/"" rel=""noreferrer"">≈Åukasz Milewski has an excellent blog post</a> explaining how this can be accomplished, which pretty much boils down to this:</p>

<pre><code>final Display display = new Display();
final Shell shell = new Shell(display);
shell.setLayout(new FormLayout());
final MARGINS margins = new MARGINS();
margins.cyTopHeight = -1;

final Composite c = new Composite(shell, SWT.NORMAL);
c.setBackground(new Color(shell.getDisplay(), new RGB(0, 0, 0)));
final FormData fd = new FormData();
fd.top = new FormAttachment(0, 0);
fd.left = new FormAttachment(0, 0);
fd.right = new FormAttachment(100, 0);
fd.bottom = new FormAttachment(100, 0);
c.setLayoutData(fd);

OS.DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea(shell.handle, margins);

shell.open();
while (!shell.isDisposed()) {
    if (!display.readAndDispatch()) {
        display.sleep();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works beautifully, until you want to add a control. This results in black remaining transparent:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/oaDYR.png"" alt=""Transparent shell with control""></p>

<p><a href=""http://www.milewski.ws/2009/05/vista-glass-in-swt-application-continuation/"" rel=""noreferrer"">A follow-up post</a> demonstrates how to do this, too, but requires modifying the SWT library. (At least, I believe so, because private SWT functions are overridden with <code>@Override</code>.)</p>

<p>How can I avoid controls becoming transparent? Even better: how can I benefit from transparency (e.g. placing images on it <a href=""http://www.milewski.ws/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/vista-glass-swt.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">like so</a>), but use it in a sensible way?</p>

"3628449","<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Tuq8T.png"" alt=""alt text"">Hi there,</p>

<p>I am trying to build a web page and i have the following problem. I tried to upload a photo but I cannot because I don't have enough votes. I have a contacts page and my problem is that there is a huge gap between the contacts (little photos with people) and the grey layer in the bottom (please vote for me so that I can upload a photo to show you what I mean). I am really confused and I don't know where the problem might be. Here I give some information:</p>

<p>I have created two lists (divs) with photos and contacts (in this picture you can see 2 photos of the leftlist (as i called it) div and one photo of the rightlist div.</p>

<p>The CSS for these two are the following:</p>

<pre><code>#leftlist {
width:430px;
position: relative;
left: 0px;
top: 0px;
bottom: 720px;}

#rightlist {
width:430px;
position: relative;
left: 450px;
bottom: 720px;
top: -670px;}
</code></pre>

<p>These two divs I placed them inside the white box as you can see from the photo which I named container. The CSS for container is:</p>

<pre><code>.container {
width:950px;
margin-top: 0;
margin-right: auto;
margin-bottom: 0px;
margin-left: auto;}
</code></pre>

<p>Here I add the whole code of the container including whats inside:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""container""&gt;
      &lt;div class=""box""&gt;
            &lt;div class=""border-top""&gt;

                  &lt;div class=""border-bot""&gt;
                     &lt;div class=""border-left""&gt;
                        &lt;div class=""left-top-corner""&gt;
                           &lt;div class=""right-top-corner""&gt;

","Structure of web page. Huge gap. HTML or CSS issue?","<html><css>","2010-09-02 15:07:20","404","3631592","2","<p>Right, there are a couple of issues with the code you have here, most notably the number of divs you are using (I assume that's just for the rounded corners?). However I believe your issue is caused by the positioning of the #leftlist and #rightlist. I can't see a reason for these to be position:relative (also when used you should only set the top value or the bottom value, not both (e.g. 'top:0px' OR 'bottom:0px').)</p>

<p>What is happening is you are moving the #rightlist from it's default position under the #leftlist. Because you are using position:relative and not position:absolute the original position is retained. The extra whitespace you are seeing is where the #rightlist should, by default, appear.</p>

<p>I would not use position in this instance. A better alternative is to use 'float:left' on both lists. If you do this your css will end up being the same for each list - try this:</p>

<pre><code>#leftlist
#rightlist {
    width:430px;
    float:left;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This may collapse the #container div which can be fixed in a number of ways, the simplest being adding 'overflow:hidden;height:100%' to #container. A quick google search should provide many more options if required.</p>

<p>Another alternative would be to use 'display:inline-block' instead of 'float:left' although this can cause issues in older browsers - it really depends on what browsers you need to support.</p>

<p>Hope this helps put you on the right track. Please leave a comment if I'm not being clear and I'll edit my response!</p>

"3628955","<p>I've come across a weird discrepancy between <code>BigInteger</code>s used by .Net 4.0 and Silverlight 4.0; In <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.numerics.biginteger_methods(v=VS.100).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">.Net</a>, <code>BigInteger</code> has a <code>Parse</code> and <code>TryParse</code> method where as in the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.numerics.biginteger_methods(v=VS.95).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Silverlight</a> version, it does not have either of these.</p>

But that's not the real point.  What you are looking at is a special version of the reference assembly.  You'll find one in <code>c:\program files\reference assemblies\microsoft\framework\.netframework\v4.0</code> for example.</p>

<p>The assemblies there have all their IL stripped from them.  Their metadata is otherwise identical to the ""real"" reference assemblies in <code>c:\windows\microsoft.net\framework\v4.0.30319</code></p>

<p>I have no clue what the function of these stripped assemblies is supposed to be.  I can only imagine they are meant to speed-up compilation, since the compiler only needs the metadata.  But that's a bit of a long shot.  I can also imagine it has something to do with the mysterious new [TargetedPatchingOptOut] attribute, a very long shot as well since the mechanism behind it isn't explained anywhere that I could find.  I had a conversation with JaredPar about this, he was going to ask inside MSFT about it.  Haven't heard back.</p>

<p>Well, no real answer, but it does explain what you saw.</p>

<hr>

<p>Following up on this, I do have one more theory, inspired when I noted that the folder is named ""v4.0"".  Note that the build number is not part of it, as it is in c:\windows\microsoft.net.  That ought to have interesting effects when they release new builds, similar to the updates to the base assemblies of .NET 2.0 when the service packs were released.</p>

<p>Infamously, one thing that went badly wrong is that these updates had changes in the core classes, <em>without</em> a change to the [AssemblyVersion].  The most visible one was the WaitHandle class, it acquired the WaitOne(int) overload.  Very useful, because nobody could ever figure out what to pass for the <em>exitContext</em> argument.  Using this new overload was easy to do, targeting .NET 2.0 doesn't prevent it, but hell breaks loose if the target machine has the original .NET 2.0 RTM release installed without getting the service packs.</p>

<p>My guess: these reference assemblies are the <em>core</em> assemblies for any current and future version of .NET 4.0.  Their public interface is frozen.  And prevents you from accidentally using a public method that gets added in a later build.  It follows that IL isn't useful because that's going to change.</p>

<p>The issue we're having is that while most of our projects show up as available dependencies, a few are missing. We've done our research, and on some machines all of our projects appear properly, but not on others. Is there any rhyme or reason to the missing projects?

"3632368","<p>FIXED by setting near clipping plane to 1, rather than 0 (not sure why it was like that to start with). See the question for skeleton code, and Adrian's answer for how and why this works.</p>

<p>I have a few different camera positions, and my scene consists of a single quad.</p>

<p>The quad is such that it projects exactly onto the viewport/window in the first frame. I want to project a texture from this camera position onto the quad. The texture also covers the viewport exactly.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was </p>

<pre><code>    // GL_QUADS...
    glTexCoord2f( /*one corner of s,t space*/);
    glVertex3f(/* appropriate vertex */);;
</code></pre>

<p>and ended up with something like (picture not mine) <img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/YSsSa.gif"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>And then I realised yes, of course, it needs to be a <em>projective</em> transformation. According to <a href=""http://www.opengl.org/resources/code/samples/sig99/advanced99/notes/node80.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">these notes</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>A modelview transform to orient the projection in the scene.</li>
<li>A projective transform (perspective or orthogonal).</li>
<li>A scale and bias to map the near clipping plane to texture coordinates.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that it works, here's a rough implementation of the code:</p>

<pre><code>// in init code
glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
glTexEnvf(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL_DECAL);

double ratio = width/height;

// set up FROM modelview matrix
glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
glLoadIdentity();


gluPerspective(pcam._fov/ratio, ratio, 1, far_z);
gluLookAt(/* FROM camera's parameters */);

glTexGeni(GL_Q, GL_TEXTURE_GEN_MODE, GL_EYE_LINEAR); //S, T, R and Q
GLfloat Splane[] = {1.f, 0.f, 0.f, 0.f}; //S, T, R and Q, diagonal
glTexGenfv(GL_S,GL_EYE_PLANE,Splane); //S, T, R and Q

// -- load and bind texture --

glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_GEN_S); //S, T, R and Q

// scale and bias
glMatrixMode(GL_TEXTURE);
glPushMatrix();
glLoadIdentity();
glTranslatef(0.5,0.5,0.0);
glScalef(0.5,0.5,1);

gluPerspective(cam._fov/ratio, ratio, 1, far_z);
gluLookAt(/* TO camera's parameters */);

glBegin(GL_QUADS);
    glVertex3f(/* for each vertex */);
glEnd();
glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_GEN_S); //S, T, R and Q

","Projecting a texture in OpenGL","<c++><opengl><3d><graphics>","2010-09-03 01:03:01","3334","3634089","1","<p>Take a look at the documentation for <a href=""http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man2/xhtml/glTexGen.xml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">glTexGen</a> (in your case, you want to use <code>GL_EYE_LINEAR</code> along with an appropriate set of coefficients as described below) and <a href=""http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/xhtml/glEnable.xml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">glEnable</a>(<code>GL_TEXTURE_GEN_*</code>). When you enable the texgen feature for particular texture coordinate components (S, T, R and/or Q), the values you specify for those components (via <code>glTexCoord</code>) are ignored and texture coordinates are instead generated according to the specified <code>glTexGen</code> mode. </p>

<p>When computing texture coordinates via <code>GL_EYE_LINEAR</code>, vertex coordinates are first transformed into eye space by the current <code>GL_MODELVIEW</code> matrix. Once in eye space, for each enabled component (S, T, R, Q), the vertex coordinates are transformed by the inverse of the <code>GL_MODELVIEW</code> matrix as defined at the time of the call to <code>glTexGen</code>, and the dot product between the resulting coordinates and the coefficients sent to <code>glTexGen</code> is then obtained. For each enabled component, the resulting scalar values become the corresponding components (S, T, R and/or Q) of the texture coordinates, which are finally transformed by the <code>GL_TEXTURE</code> matrix to produce the final texture coordinates.</p>

<p>For each texture component, the coefficients (a, b, c, d) sent to <code>glTexGen</code> define a plane ax + by + cz + d = 0. Assuming (a, b, c) is a vector of unit length, the result of the dot product operation described above represents the distance between this plane and the vertex being processed. If <code>GL_EYE_LINEAR</code> is enabled for all four texture components and the plane equations for S, T, R and Q are defined respectively as (1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0), and (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0), the texture coordinates produced for each texture component are then exactly the same as the original object-space vertex coordinates. Thus, the <code>GL_TEXTURE</code> matrix should contain whatever operations are needed to transform these coordinates from object space to texture space: <em>modeling</em>, <em>viewing</em> and <em>projection</em> transforms to convert from object coordinates to normalized device coordinates, plus <em>scale</em> and <em>bias</em> transforms to convert from normalized device coordinates to texture space.</p>

"3632751","<p>I've got a path that is made up of multiple points - i.e. 0,0  0,50  50,50  70,20</p>

<p>If I just draw this line on the screen it looks quite harsh as it puts a sharp angle at the joining of each point.</p>

<p>Hence I was wondering what the bezier curves algorithm/method would look like which I could call that automatically change the sharp angles to ""tight"" curves?</p>

<p>I wouldn't want the curve to be too big or generally effect the fall of main path, just soften the join out. If you have a look at the below here is a quick sample I have put together. The line on the left is what I have now, the one in the middle is the line I want. </p>

<p>The image on the right represents what I think I need the algorithm to do. Essentially, I add an additional point to each arc that makes up the join at a point which 10% away from the join, then I remove the join point and adjust the handles so that they are where the point was (not in the diagram they are slightly apart, this is just so that you can see). This is what I need to be able to do.</p>

If you want to enlarge the center selected image there is one possible way.
On your onItemSelected method, just call an animation to zoom the object. The property of gallery is that it is always center-locked. So the center element will be always selected.
Hope that will work..</p>

&lt;/set&gt;

<p>Do remember that you will have to store the previous view as when the element is move away from center it should be put to the normal size.</p>

<p>So you can have two views - prevView and currView.<br>
Do the animation on the currView.  </p>

<p>Is there anything else I can do to trace the cause of the jettison? Does anyone know what the Count resident pages number in the crash report means?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Is there any way of getting the count of resident pages as the app runs? </p>

<p>The root of the problem was several calls to [UIImage imageNamed:], which cached the image data. Swapping calls from this method to a method that doesn't cache solved the problem.</p>

"3634663","<p>One neat typographic effect often seen headlines in magazines etc, is to select a really bold font and put an image inside of the text. Here's a random example of the effect:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/1ieF4.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>In web design, there is no way to do this with plain html/css/js. It could be done with flash or with a bitmap image but those techniques obviously have some big drawbacks.</p>

<p>I wonder if it is possible to do this with SVG though? I have never ever used SVG, but if this is possible, it might be worth trying to wrap my head around it.</p>

<p>For instance, would it be possible to let a javascript go through the page and look for certain elements (h1s or certain classes) and generate, on the fly, an SVG file that contains selectable text in the chosen font with an image clipped to the letter shapes? Does anyone know if this has been done, tutorials, anything else that might be interesting for looking at this problem...</p>
","Masking an image with selectable text with SVG - possible?","<svg><masking>","2010-09-03 09:59:49","5399","3636303","2","<p>It is possible to do this with SVG, though you don't need to do masking, you can just specify the image as a pattern:</p>

        &lt;image xlink:href=""daisy-grass-repeating-background.jpg"" x=""0"" y=""0""

<p>I've done <a href=""http://www.boogdesign.com/examples/svg/pattern-fill.svg"" rel=""noreferrer"">an example</a>, the most painful part was figuring out what <code>patternUnits</code> and <code>patternContentUnits</code> actually did, <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SVG/Tutorial/Fill_Stroke_and_Gradients#Patterns"" rel=""noreferrer"">this MDC article was helpful</a>.</p>

<p>In model - there's that strange thing: 1 on 1 relation. It's like there's a <code>Contest</code> (Foo), and <code>Participant</code>. Tabs are detailed description of <code>Participant</code>.</p>

<p>Currently I've modeled them both as <a href=""http://domaindrivendesign.org/node/88"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">aggregate roots</a>. But it might be a wrong choice.</p>

<p>So - if there are two roots, it seems natural if both of them got controllers and <code>Contest</code> isn't really responsible to hold all data.</p>

<p>It seems that sub actions would be the way to go, but I foresee some complexity. When tabs will hold some actions, they will need to know how to redirect back to <code>Contest</code> details and how to pass info how to render correct tab. This coupling I would like to avoid but it seems there's no way to do that.</p>

<p><strong>Option 1</strong>. Partial Views with RenderPartial(). Each tab is a partial view that renders some portion of your Model. For example, you would have a FinancialInformation.aspx partial view that renders Model.FinancialInformation.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2a</strong>. Sub Actions with RenderAction(). Similar to above except that each tab is responsible for pulling its own data by calling an action method either on the same controller or more likely another controller that specializes in that information.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2b</strong>. Same as 2a except that the tabs are rendered on demand using AJAX. </p>

<p>I should point out that <em>none of these options is mutually exclusive</em>. You might use option 1 (RenderPartial()) for the first two tabs since that data is inherently part of your model. And you might use option 2 (RenderAction()) for the other two tabs because, for example, you might have a ChartController the specializes in rendering charts ...</p>

<li>Icons are grouped, and those groups should be collapsible.</li>
<li>If the height of the widget exceeds its space, a vertical scrollbar should appear.</li>

<p>At the top level, add <code>QTreeWidget</code> or <code>QTreeView</code> will give you the hierarchy you're looking for, as well as managing the scrolling area.</p>

<p>Each Listed Item of the (expanded) <code>QTreeXItem</code> will be a <code>QListView</code>/<code>QListWidget</code>, setting <code>setViewMode(QListView::IconMode)</code> on them.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Note that to get the precise look you wanted above, you'll probably have to use QListView and use a custom delegate, handling the drawing yourself (unless you can find a theme that will do exactly what you want). However, I've coded up a short PyQt solution below using the Q*Widget classes because they're shorter, and will still demonstrate how to get the right layout. If you're using C++, the same Qt function calls apply, but obviously you might have more or less bookkeeping.</p>

<p>I thought that I found the way to resolve my problem by:</p>

            schoolContext.SaveChanges();

<p>because it added Bill to persons, but...because PersonID is not nullable, and it inserted him with id 0. When I tried add another person the same way of course I get error about primary key :)</p>

","Identity column in EF 4","<c#><entity-framework-4><primary-key>","2010-09-04 11:11:17","5306","3642216","3","<p>I cannot tell you why the EF team chose to do it this way - my only guess would be that the code generation that create the <code>CreatePerson</code> method doesn't check to see whether or not the ID is an autoincrement and just creates a method that will work in any circumstance - whether the ID is autoincrement or not.</p>

<p>If this really bothers you, you can also benefit from the fact that the generated entity class <code>Person</code> is defined as a <strong>partial class</strong>, so you can extend it easily. Create a new class file called e.g. <code>PersonEx.cs</code> and extend that partial class:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class Person 
{
    public static Person CreatePerson(string lastName, string firstName)
    {
        return CreatePerson(-1, lastName, firstName);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, you can easily create your <code>Person</code> entities without specifying an ID, and add them to your data:</p>

<pre><code> using(SchoolEntities context = new SchoolEntities())
 {
     Person newPerson = Person.CreatePerson(""Gates"", ""Bill"");
     context.AddToPeople(newPerson);

     context.SaveChanges();

     int newID = newPerson.PersonID;
 }

<p>This is one of the horrors induced by VB.NET's support for using the <em>type</em> name of a form to refer to the <em>instance</em> of the form.  It is an anachronism carried over from VB6 where using the type name of a form was normal.</p>

<p>This falls apart when you use threads because ""FormMain"" has thread affinity.  In other words, it has the <code>&lt;ThreadStatic&gt;</code> attribute.  When you use it in a worker thread then you get a <em>new</em> instance of the form, not the one that the user is looking at.  This new instance isn't visible because its Show() method was never called.  Which is why you don't see your code having any effect.  If you call Show() in your code then you'll see it pop up.  It is however quite dead, the thread isn't pumping a message loop.  Another effect you should have noticed was that InvokeRequired is False, you know that can't be right.</p>

<p>You will have to stop using FormMain.  If this code lives inside that class then you can simply use Me.  If it doesn't then you'll have to pass the form reference with a property or a constructor argument.  The Q&amp;D fix is to use Application.OpenForms(0)</p>

<p>The technique for something like this is to create the table view in IB, then create all of the cells you want to use for the parts individually - create IBOutlets for them, and then wire them up to a table view controller.  For something like the above you'd use a grouped table view.</p>

<p>Now in the table view controller you can just return the IBOutlets in CellForRow, and also use them to return the correct height for a cell.</p>

"3644037","<p>I am trying to translate a function in a book into code, using MATLAB and C#.</p>

<p>I am first trying to get the function to work properly in MATLAB.</p>

<p>Here are the instructions: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/GHd9g.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The variables are:</p>

<pre><code>xt and m can be ignored.
zMax = Maximum Sensor Range (100)
zkt = Sensor Measurement (49)
zkt* = What sensor measurement should have been (50)
oHit = Std Deviation of my measurement (5)
</code></pre>

<p>I have written the first formula, N(zkt;zkt*,oHit) in MATLAB as this:</p>

<pre><code>hitProbabilty = (1/sqrt( 2*pi * (oHit^2) ))...
                * exp(-0.5 * (((zkt- zktStar) ^ 2) / (oHit^2))  );
</code></pre>

<p>This gives me the Gaussian curve I expect.</p>

<p>I have an issue with the definite integral below, I do not understand how to turn this into a real number, because I get horrible values out my code, which is this:</p>

<pre><code>func = @(x) hitProbabilty * zkt * x;
normaliser = quad(func, 0, max) ^ -1;  
hitProbabilty = normaliser * hitProbabilty;
</code></pre>

<p>Can someone help me with this integral? It is supposed to normalize my curve, but it just goes crazy.... (I am doing this for zkt 0:1:100, with everything else the same, and graphing the probability it should output.)</p>

<p>I think there's been a small confusion seeing the comments.. The above only compute the normalizing factor, so if you want to compute the final probability over a certain range of values, you should do this:</p>

<pre><code>zMax = 100;                         %# Maximum Sensor Range
zktStar = 50;                       %# What sensor measurement should have been
oHit = 5;                           %# Std Deviation of my measurement

%# p(0&lt;z&lt;zMax) = p(z&lt;zMax) - p(z&lt;0)
ncdf = diff( normcdf([0 zMax], zktStar, oHit) );
normaliser = 1 ./ ncdf;

zkt = linspace(0,zMax,500);         %# Sensor Measurement, 500 values in [0,zMax]
hitProbabilty = normpdf(zkt, zktStar, oHit) * normaliser;

"3647797","<p>I have a question regarding this database design. I am a bit unsure of the difference between identifying and non-identifying relationships in a database leading me to some puzzles in my head. </p>

<p>I have this database design: <em>(kind of like a movie rental stores. ""friend"" are those who borrow the movie. ""studio"" is the production studios that collaborated in making the movie.)</em></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/VxqRn.png"" alt=""Sample.png""></p>

<p>I somewhat understand how it works. However, I was wondering what if I create a <strong>loan_id</strong> in the loan table, and use <strong>movie_id</strong> and <strong>friend_id</strong> as normal foreign keys? </p>

<p>Some of my questions are:
What are the advantages or disadvantages of the later approach? 
A situation where the initial or later model is better?
Does the initial model enable a friend to borrow a movie more than once?</p>

<p>Any thorough explanation would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>When you have a composite pk, a lot of db designers prefer to create a surrogate primary key (like your proposed loan_id). I'm one of them.

<p>My relatively simple reason for it, is composite keys tend to grow: Using the loan example, what happens if that movies loaned more than once? Using the composite approach, you would then have to add loan_date to the composite key. </p>

<p>What if you then wanted to track re-loans of some sort? You would then have to have a 2nd table carrying all the composite pk fields from the loan table (original_loan_movie_id, original_loan_friend_id, original_loan_date) just to refer to the original loan...</p>

"3647871","<p>My website is in the root directory, which is <code>/www.lebmotor.com/web/content/</code>.</p>

Dim directory As String = appPath &amp; ""/upload/"" &amp; Left(TableName, 2) &amp; ""/""  
</code></pre>

<p>to get the path and it's working very well.</p>

<p>But when I create a new sub-folder and copy some pages from the root directory into the sub-folder, my images are not displayed because the path has changed.</p>

<p>This is the link from the page in the root directory:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So how can I make the link in the sub folder like this:</p>

<blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Let me explain more about this. First, I have two directories and both of them have been set as application directories, as you can see here in the photo:</p>

<p><img src=""https://jhpdxa.blu.livefilestore.com/y1pZHEa9MdjD2tPnDqvdpI8rscYkILJ0FkwCuLWKKL50v_EGT_1bF7Sv4ZxvZehTh7n1eSyPcQ6JgDZIKVtnr2EphRN9WwWaIK3/HERE.png?psid=1"" alt=""""></p>

<p>The <code>/ar</code> sub-folder is an application and it's a copy of the original one in the Content directory.</p>

<p>In the <code>ar/App_code</code> there is a class with the name <code>MGImages.vp</code>, and course it's a copy of the original one in <code>Content/App_code</code>. This class' job is to display photos from the <code>Upload</code> sub folder.</p>

<p>This is the code which will save the path of the photo:</p>

<pre><code>Dim appPath As String = HttpContext.Current.Request.ApplicationPath  
Dim directory As String = appPath &amp; ""/upload/"" &amp; Left(TableName, 2) &amp; ""/""  
If ImageType.ToUpper = ""TN"" Then  
    directory += ""TN/""  
ElseIf ImageType.ToUpper = ""LG"" Then  
    directory += ""LG/""  
Else  
    directory += ""OT/""  
End If  
</code></pre>

<p>This class is working very well in the <code>Content</code> directory because this will give me the right path:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.lebmotor.com/upload/VE/TN/6/VEListing-66-Photo1.jpg?ts=9/4/2010%201:45:17%20AM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.lebmotor.com/upload/VE/TN/6/VEListing-66-Photo1.jpg?ts=9/4/2010%201:45:17%20AM</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>All photos should be saved in the <code>Content/Upload</code> folder for both directories' <code>Content/ar</code></p>

<p>But in the <code>ar</code> directory it will give me the wrong path:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.lebmotor.com/ar/upload/VE/TN/6/VEListing-66-Photo1.jpg?ts=9/4/2010%201:45:17%20AM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.lebmotor.com/ar/upload/VE/TN/6/VEListing-66-Photo1.jpg?ts=9/4/2010%201:45:17%20AM</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where the goal is to make the path like this one:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.lebmotor.com/upload/VE/TN/6/VEListing-66-Photo1.jpg?ts=9/4/2010%201:45:17%20AM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.lebmotor.com/upload/VE/TN/6/VEListing-66-Photo1.jpg?ts=9/4/2010%201:45:17%20AM</a></p>

"3648831","<p>I know there are plenty of resources on this but I'm having a tough time relating any of them to my situation so I was hoping someone could help me clarify how this works:</p>

<p>Basically I have a model <code>Action</code>, (which gets created anytime a user does something that affects another user, like commenting on their article or voting on someones photo, for example), these actions will be listed in the users dashboard page as all the actions that have taken place that relate to them, like a stream... sort of like Github's ""News Feed""</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/EAqmU.jpg"" alt=""Github&#39;s &quot;News Feed&quot;""></p>

<p>I've decided to go with creating a polymorphic association, here is what my model looks like:</p>

<pre><code>class Action &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :instigator, :polymorphic =&gt; true
  belongs_to :victim, :polymorphic =&gt; true
end
</code></pre>

<p>I used instigator and victim because anyone can create these actions, which in turn always affect another user, here is my <code>User</code> model</p>

<pre><code>class User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :actions, :as =&gt; :instigator
  has_many :actions, :as =&gt; :victim
end
</code></pre>

<p>And this is where <em>I think</em> I'm going wrong, because ultimately I want to have a query which when I run something like <code>User.find(1).actions</code> to actually return all the instances in which the user is both an <code>instigator</code> or a <code>victim</code>, I think I can't have both of those <code>have_many</code>'s in there, because when used like this I only get the instances where the user is the <code>victim</code>.</p>

<p>Here is my migration:</p>

<pre><code>create_table :actions do |t|
  t.references :instigator, :polymorphic =&gt; true
  t.references :victim, :polymorphic =&gt; true
  t.string :action_performed
  t.references :resource, :polymorphic =&gt; true
  t.timestamps
end
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks for any help, I always love the great suggestions and help the SO community gives.</p>

<p>which indicates that the 6th instances was misclassified. Note that even if you train and test on the same instances, misclassifications can occur due to inconsistencies in the data (the simplest example is having two instances with the same features but with different class label).</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the above way of testing is biased (its somewhat cheating since it can see the answers to the questions). Thus we are usually interested in getting a more realistic estimate of the model error on unseen data. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_%28statistics%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Cross-validation</a> is one such technique, where it partition the data into 10 stratified folds, performing the testing on one fold, while training on the other nine, finally it reports the average accuracy across the ten runs.</p>

","Scrolling through ListView with some images very laggy","<android><performance><android-listview>","2010-09-06 12:21:41","10687","3656365","3","<p>The problem is that each image is decoded at the moment the view is prepared for showing. The ListView will recycle your views that means that at the moment a view leaves the screen it will be reused and therefore the image will be overwritten and garbage collected. If the item reenters the screen the image has to be decoded from the database again. </p>

<p>The decoding is reasonable fast but if the user changes the position in the list very quickly all the decoding calls will make your list very laggy. </p>

<p>I would implment something like an ImageCache. A class that holds a Map with <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/ref/WeakReference.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">WeakReferences</a> to images. Everytime you want to display an image you take a look if the image is allready in the map and if the WeakReference still points to an object, if this is not the case you need to decode the image and then store it in the map. </p>

<p>Take a look at the lazy loading questions, these will show you how to put the decoding in a background task and then update the list the moment the images are loaded. It is a bit more effort but it can make the list much much more faster. If you are going to use the code example from the lazy loading questions try to use <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">AsyncTasks</a> instead of Threads to do the decoding in. </p>

You should only do that if you actually <em>want</em> to use Dynamic LINQ.</p>

<p>Dynamic LINQ lets you express queries as text - a bit like with <code>DataTable.Select</code>. I've personally never found a use for it, but you <em>may</em> want it. It should be a deliberate choice though. Most of the time you'll be fine with the statically typed LINQ to Objects.</p>

<p>EDIT: As per the OP's comment, the code for Dynamic LINQ could have been added directly to the project, rather than referenced as a separate assembly. Even if you <em>do</em> actually want to use Dynamic LINQ, I'd strongly recommend keeping it in a separate assembly rather than mixing it in with your own code.</p>

The downside, of course, is that you have to use unsafe code; if you make a mistake, you can cause some really bad crashes in your program. But if you keep it simple and self-contained, it should be fine (hey, if I can do, you can do it too).</p>

<p>For example, you could do something like this (not tested, use at your own risk):</p>

<pre><code>Bitmap mask = ...;
Bitmap input = ...;

Bitmap output = new Bitmap(input.Width, input.Height, PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb);
var rect = new Rectangle(0, 0, input.Width, input.Height);
var bitsMask = mask.LockBits(rect, ImageLockMode.ReadOnly, PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb);
var bitsInput = input.LockBits(rect, ImageLockMode.ReadOnly, PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb);
var bitsOutput = output.LockBits(rect, ImageLockMode.WriteOnly, PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb);

{
    for (int y = 0; y &lt; input.Height; y++)
    {
        byte* ptrMask = (byte*) bitsMask.Scan0 + y * bitsMask.Stride;
        byte* ptrInput = (byte*) bitsInput.Scan0 + y * bitsInput.Stride;
        byte* ptrOutput = (byte*) bitsOutput.Scan0 + y * bitsOutput.Stride;
        for (int x = 0; x &lt; input.Width; x++)
        {
            ptrOutput[4 * x] = ptrInput[4 * x];           // blue
            ptrOutput[4 * x + 1] = ptrInput[4 * x + 1];   // green
            ptrOutput[4 * x + 2] = ptrInput[4 * x + 2];   // red
            ptrOutput[4 * x + 3] = ptrMask[4 * x];        // alpha
        }
    }

mask.UnlockBits(bitsMask);
input.UnlockBits(bitsInput);
output.UnlockBits(bitsOutput);

<li>Is it okay to say that, the Zend_Log contains reference to array of Zend_Log_Filter_Interface and this is composition relationship (similarly for Zend_Log_Writer_Abstract)?</li>
<li>As it is obvious that Zend_Log_Filter_Interface is contained by both Zend_Log &amp; Zend_Log_Writer_Abstract, while Zend_Log contains Zend_Log_Writer_Abstract, that makes Zend_Log_Filter referenced by both container (Zend_Log) and contained (Zend_Log_Writer_Abstract); is that some ""Design Pattern"", if yes what is the name?</li>
</ol>

<li><p><code>Zend_Log_Filter_Suppress</code>, <code>Zend_Log_Filter_Message</code>, and <code>Zend_Log_Filter_Priority</code> all implement the <code>Zend_Log_Filter_Interface</code> interface. This is denoted using the empty arrow and dotted lines between them. The same is true for <code>Zend_Log_Formatter_Interface</code> and the three classes depicted below it.</p></li>
<li><p>Yes, that's correct. Whether to use an association (-->) or composition here could be debated since two <code>Zend_Log</code> instances could share a single <code>Zend_Log_Writer_Db</code> instance. As the writers and filters determine the overall behavior of the log, composition makes sense to me.</p></li>
<li><p>Each log instance can write to multiple writers. Messages are first filtered by the log itself, and any message that passes goes to every writer. Each writer filters the incoming messages as well. This allows you to ignore all messages below the <code>WARN</code> priority (at the log level) which get written to a file and further limit database logging to those at the <code>FATAL</code> level. You could accomplish the same effect by dropping the log-level filter array, but it would require duplicating the filtering in each writer.</p></li>

So basically, make the code reflect that the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> is the big east conference and each of the teams be list items.
Like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;The Big East&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Team 2&lt;/li&gt;

<p>This way the code makes sense to screen readers and is most SEO compliant.
Now, as far as how to then arrange the images, you can do it completely in CSS.  So for the h1 you just do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>h1{background-image:url(images/bigeast.png);text-indent:-9999px;display:block;overflow:hidden;}
</code></pre>

<p>The indent just sends the text outside of the h1 so it can't be seen while keeping the good markup intact.  Just do the same with all of the li's and you'll have all of your images in place.  Then simply set all of the positions on the elements to absolute and position them on the page with something like left:238px; and top:20px;
I know it seems like a pain, but it's really not all that hard, especially if you use firebug.
Make sense?</p>

"3655316","<p>I'm having trouble with loading CSS and images and creating links to other pages when I have a servlet forward to a JSP. Specifically, when I set my <code>&lt;welcome-file&gt;</code> to <code>index.jsp</code>, the CSS is being loaded and my images are being displayed. However, if I set my <code>&lt;welcome-file&gt;</code> to <code>HomeServlet</code> which forwards control to <code>index.jsp</code>, the CSS is not being applied and my images are not being displayed. </p>

<p>My CSS file is in <code>web/styles/default.css</code>.<br>
My images are in <code>web/images/</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong>: I've added the structure of the application, as well as some other information that might help.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/nf0zO.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The <code>header.jsp</code> file is the file that contains the link tag for the CSS. The <code>HomeServlet</code> is set as my <code>welcome-file</code> in <code>web.xml</code>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;welcome-file-list&gt;
    &lt;welcome-file&gt;HomeServlet&lt;/welcome-file&gt;
&lt;/welcome-file-list&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The servlet is declared and mapped as followes in the <code>web.xml</code>:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;servlet&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;HomeServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.brianblog.frontend.HomeServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;

    &lt;servlet-name&gt;HomeServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
&lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong>: I found the problem finally - my servlet was mapped incorrectly. Apparently when setting a Servlet as your <code>&lt;welcome-file&gt;</code> it can't have a URL pattern of <code>/</code>, which I find sort of weird, because wouldn't that stand for the root directory of the site?</p>

<p>The new mapping is as follows:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;servlet-mapping&gt;
    &lt;servlet-name&gt;HomeServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
    &lt;url-pattern&gt;/HomeServlet&lt;/url-pattern&gt;

<p>Apart from changing the relative URLs to make them relative to the URL of the servlet instead of the location of the JSP file, another way to fix this problem is to make them relative to the domain root (i.e. start with a <code>/</code>). This way you don't need to worry about changing the relative paths once again when you change the URL of the servlet.</p>

<p>Either way, this is in turn pretty cumbersome if you have a lot of relative URLs. For that you can use the <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> tag. All relative URL's will instantly become relative to it. It has however to start with the scheme (<code>http://</code>, <code>https://</code>, etc). There's no neat way to obtain the base context path in plain EL, so we need a little help of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/tags/jstl/info"">JSTL</a> here.</p>

<p>This has in turn (again) some caveats. Anchors (the <code>#identifier</code> URL's) will become relative to the base path as well! You would like to make it relative to the request URL (URI) instead. So, change like</p>
<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;a href=&quot;#identifier&quot;&gt;jump&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;a href=&quot;${uri}#identifier&quot;&gt;jump&lt;/a&gt;

<p>Each way has its own pros and cons. It's up to you which to choose. At least, you should now understand how this problem is caused and how to solve it :)</p>

That can be done easily enough with a HSL or HSV transformations.  Check Wikipedia for HSL and HSV color spaces to get some understanding of the theory involved.</p>

<p>Basic idea:  Computers represent color with a mixture of red intensity, green intensity and blue intensity, called RGB, because that's the way the screen displays color.  HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) are two alternative models for representing color that are more intuitive and closer to the way human beings tend to think about how colors look.</p>

<p>Hue is the basic color, represented (more or less) as an angle on a color wheel.  Saturation is a linear value, from 0 (gray) to 255 (bright, vibrant color).  And Lightness/Value represent brightness, from 0 (black) to 100 (white).</p>

<p>The algorithms to transform from RGB -> HSL and HSL -> RGB (or HSV instead of HSL) are pretty straightforward.  Try transforming your color to HS*, adjusting the brightness, and transforming back.  By taking several different brightness values from low to high, and arranging them as wedges in a pie chart, you can duplicate that picture pretty easily.</p>

"3655979","<p>I've got a little objective-c utility program that renders a convex hull.  (This is to troubleshoot a bug in another program that calculates the convex hull in preparation for spatial statistical analysis).  I'm trying to render a set of triangles, each with an outward-pointing vector.  I can get the triangles without problems, but the vectors are driving me crazy.</p>

<p>I'd like the vectors to be simple cylinders.  The problem is that I can't just declare coordinates for where the top and bottom of the cylinders belong in 3D (e.g., like I can for the triangles).  I have to make them and then rotate and translate them from their default position along the z-axis.  I've read a ton about Euler angles, and angle-axis rotations, and quaternions, most of which is relevant, but not directed at what I need:  most people have a set of objects and then need to rotate the object in response to some input.  I need to place the object correctly in the 3D ""scene"".</p>

<p>I'm using the <a href=""http://c3dt.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cocoa3DTutorial</a> classes to help me out, and they work great as far as I can tell, but the rotation bit is killing me.  </p>

<p>Here is my current effort.  It gives me cylinders that are located correctly, but all point along the z-axis (as in this image:<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/vTPGI.png"" alt=""alt text"">.  We are looking in the -z direction.  The triangle poking out behind is not part of the hull; for testing/debugging.  The orthogonal cylinders are coordinate axes, more or less, and the spheres are to make sure the axes are located correctly, since I have to use rotation to place those cylinders correctly.  And BTW, when I use that algorithm, the out-vectors fail as well, although in a different way, coming out normal to the planes, but all pointing in +z instead of some in -z)</p>

<p>I added the bit in the above code that uses a single rotation around an axis (the ""if (_rotation.w != 0.0)"" bit), rather than a set of three rotations.  My code is likely the problem, but I can't see how.</p>

<p>In addition, MATLAB provides the choice among a number of distance measures (Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine, ...). One neat option <code>emptyaction</code> allows you to control what happens when a cluster loses all its assigned member during the iterations.</p>

<p>But the real advantage is that it employs a two-phase algorithm: the usual assign-recompute iterations, followed by an online update phase. Be sure to read the algorithm section of the <a href=""http://www.mathworks.com/help/toolbox/stats/kmeans.html#f3884002"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">documentation page</a> for more information.</p>

"3657837","<p>I have just finished incorporating a jQuery accordian with a jQuery Slider.
I.e.</p>

<p>3 pictures are displayed. The user can either use <code>PREV</code> or <code>NEXT</code> buttons to view the next/prev 3 images. They can also navigate through all the images with the slider.</p>

<p>The next step is to make this slider look like a timeline. The left hand side needs to start at 1970 and finish at 2010. For each item (an item is a set of 3 images in this case) I need it to show a date on the timeline.</p>

<p>i.e: <img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/CG7u8.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Yep, fairly. To map the point (x1,y1) via rotation around the origin:</p>

<pre><code>x2 = cos(a) * x1 + sin(a) * y1;
y2 = cos(a) * y1 - sin(a) * x1;
</code></pre>

<p>... so you just first need to translate to the origin i.e. (-50,-50) in your example and translate back after rotation.</p>

<pre><code>x2 = cos(a) * (x1 - 50) + sin(a) * (y1 - 50) + 50;
y2 = cos(a) * (y1 - 50) - sin(a) * (x1 - 50) + 50;

"3659794","<p>I'm currently redesigning a website and have run into an issue with some elements in the header. The header contains a logo, some text and a navigation bar. Between the bottom of the logo and the top of the navigation bar there is a relatively thick gap, shown in this screenshot:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/hBLc8.png"" alt=""Problem""></p>

<p>I don't want the gap, I don't know where it's come from and I don't know how to get rid of it :(</p>

<p>I can reduce it down to a single pixel by setting the <code>line-height</code> property of the div containing the logo down to <code>0.0</code>, but it seems hacky and still doesn't fix the issue.</p>

"3660063","<p>I have built a UserControl for display a list of other UserControls which themselves are bound to individual data objects.  The link below shows an example implementation of this control.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ST2Vf.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Each of the individual user rows is its own UserControl/XtraUserControl, laid out in a FlowLayoutPanel.</p>

<p>The problem I have is with perfomance, to populate the list above takes around <strong>500ms</strong> (excluding any data loading) - this is a combination of creating each control and then adding them to the FlowLayoutPanel using the AddRange(controls[]) method.</p>

<p>Does anyone know any way I can improve perfomance here?  Do I have to manually paint the items instead of using User Controls?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: I've added my own response below showing the solution I have stuck with for now.</strong></p>
","Winforms Usercontrol: Perfomance issues when creating and adding to parent","<winforms><performance><user-controls><devexpress>","2010-09-07 15:22:53","1395","3668591","4","<p>I had a brainwave for another solution which I'm not quite sure is appropriate. I would really appreciate any feedback on this.</p>

<p>Two rationales led to this solution:</p>

<ul>
<li>Firstly I wanted <strong>the flexibility of creating rows like any other control</strong>. </li>
<li>Secondly the lists that would use this approach only intend to <strong>display brief chunks of data</strong>, never more than say 20 items - for anything larger, ListViews are used.</li>
</ul>

<p>So anyway, what I decided to do was cache a set number of the Panels (I've referred to the custom controls or rows as Panels throughout the code) and to build up this cache as the control is created.  When populating the control with BusinessObjects, the existing cached Panels are displayed with their bound BusinessObject.  You can see how this works exactly from the code below, so there is no need for a in-depth description.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that I've managed to reduce the data population time (after the initial cache setup of around 180ms for 10 Panels) from <strong>500ms</strong> to <strong>150ms</strong> for the list shown in the image above.</p>

<pre><code>private int cacheSize = 10;
private List&lt;P&gt; cachedPanels = new List&lt;P&gt;(10);
private void InitItems()
{
    this.contentPanel.SuspendLayout();

    // Create the cached panels from the default cache value.
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; cacheSize; i++)
        cachedPanels.Add(new P() { Margin = new Padding(0), Visible = false });

    this.contentPanel.Controls.AddRange(cachedPanels.ToArray());

    this.contentPanel.ResumeLayout(true);
}

private void PopulateListFromCache()
{
    this.contentPanel.SuspendLayout();

    // Iterate against both BusinessObjects and Panels to ensure that nothing is missed, for
    // instance, where there are too many panels, the rest are hidden, and too many Business
    // Objects, then more Panels are created.
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; this.businessObjects.Count || i &lt; this.cachedPanels.Count; i++)
    {
        if (i &gt;= this.cachedPanels.Count)
        {
            // Here, we have more BusinessObjects than Panels, thus we must create
            // and assign a new panel.
            this.cachedPanels.Add(new P() { Margin = new Padding(0) });
            this.cachedPanels[i].Item = this.businessObjects[i];
            this.contentPanel.Controls.Add(this.cachedPanels[i]);
        }
        else if (i &gt;= this.businessObjects.Count)
        {
            // Here, we still have Panels cached but have run out of BusinessObjects,
            // let's just hide them and clear their bindings.
            this.cachedPanels[i].Item = default(T);
            this.cachedPanels[i].Visible = false;
        }
        else
        {
            // Here, we have both BusinessObjects and Panels to put them in, so just
            // update the binding and ensure the Panel is visible.
            this.cachedPanels[i].Item = this.businessObjects[i];
            this.cachedPanels[i].Visible = true;
        }
    }

    this.contentPanel.ResumeLayout(true);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, more optimizations can be made, such as un-caching Panels after a certain amount of time of not being used etc.  Also, I'm not entirely sure if keeping these controls - which are rather simple - in a cache will affect memory usage much.</p>

<p>If anyone can think of any other pointers then please, be my guest. Oh, and if you got this far, then thank you for reading this.</p>

    }
</code></pre>

<p>After this i want to put these 3 on my page. The Result is something like this there one Office(loadedGesellschaft) and that has maybe more than one Adress(loadedGesellschaftAnschrift) and has maybe more than one Email(loadedGesellschaftEmail)
so i have on my window some textboxes which contain the fields from loadedGesellschaft and Adresses and Emails are stored in comboboxes.</p>

<p>do i always have to bind the itemsource of one Control e.g.</p>

<p><code>&lt;ComboBox   Name=""CBox_GDEmail"" /&gt;</code></p>

<pre><code>CBoxGDEmail.Itemsource = loadedGesellschaftEmail;
</code></pre>

<p>or is there an possibility to put all three objects together to the datacontext of the window ? </p>

These classes are view models; they expose any property whose value you want to see in the view.  Make <code>Gesellschaft</code> expose an <code>Anschriften</code> property of type <code>IEnumerable&lt;Anschrift&gt;</code>, and <code>Anschrift</code> expose an <code>Emails</code> property of type <code>IEnumerable&lt;Email&gt;</code>.  (I'm just sort of guessing at what the plural of Anschrift is; pretty much all of my knowledge of German comes from board games.)</p>

<p>In your XAML, create three <code>DataTemplate</code>s, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;DataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type local:Gesellschaft}""&gt;
   &lt;WrapPanel&gt;
      &lt;Label&gt;Name&lt;/Label&gt;
      &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding Gesellschaftname}""/&gt;
      ...
      &lt;ListBox ItemsSource=""{Binding Anschriften}""/&gt;
  &lt;/WrapPanel&gt;
&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously you'll want to use a saner layout than sticking a bunch of controls in a <code>WrapPanel</code>; this is just a proof of concept.  The <code>DataTemplate</code> for <code>Anschrift</code> should similarly have a <code>ListBox</code> whose <code>ItemsSource</code> is bound to <code>Emails</code>.</p>

<p>Once you've done this, all you need in your XAML is to set the <code>DataContext</code> of a <code>ContentPresenter</code> to an instance of <code>Gesellschaft</code>.  It will be rendered using the <code>DataTemplate</code> that you've defined for that type.  Its <code>ListBox</code> will contain an item for each <code>Anschrift</code>, rendered using that type's template.  U.s.w.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you're now using the MVVM pattern just like all the cool kids.  There's a lot more to learn about than just this, but this is a good start.  </p>

For completeness, I'm also including what others have suggested: instead of using a <code>&lt;br/&gt;</code> element, control the line-break via CSS. This has the advantage, that you can change the behavior (remove the line-break) by simply editing the CSS:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
.name { font-weight: bold; display:block; }
.subtext { font-size: smaller; }

<p>Instead of using <code>span</code> elements, you could also use <code>div</code>s, which have the line-break by default (but it can be disabled by setting <code>display:inline</code> in the CSS).</p>

<p>This works ok, however due to differences in the length of the data displayed, there is still wasted space in item groups because most of the data fits on a single line, but occasionally there is an item which takes up 2 or more rows.

<li><p>Inside SSMS, save the script as an Unicode file: <em>Save</em> ‚Üí <em>Save with Encoding...</em> ‚Üí <em>Encoding : Unicode (UTF-8 with signature)</em>. You will then be able to open it probably correctly in Word. The problem is that syntax highlighting will be lost.</p></li>
<li><p>Save the script as an Unicode file, than reopen it and copy-paste. Maybe SSMS assume for some reasons that there is some fancy encoding by default, so this will force it to use UTF-8 instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to paste in different applications (for example the browser). Looking at the first line at your screenshot, I remember once seeing the same problem with some browser renderings described on Wikipedia (can't find the link).</p></li>
<li><p>Try copying the same text from Visual Studio (if installed). Copying source code from Visual Studio to Office programs preserve syntax highlighting, so if you observe the same issue, it may come from this syntax highlighting feature.</p></li>
<li><p>If nothing works, report the problem to <a href=""https://connect.microsoft.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft Connect</a>, describing precisely the situation so the people at Microsoft will be able to reproduce this issue.</p></li>

"3665206","<p>I'm new to c#, and trying to learn by writing some simple apps to get familiar with the syntax and .NET library.

<p>One of the problems I noticed early on was that the app would constantly ""flicker"", which really took away from the presentation, so I read online about how to implement a double buffer, which eliminated this problem, but may or may not have something to do with the problem.  Here is my <code>onPaint</code> method; it is called every 33ms (~30 FPS) by a timer control.

<p>I thought by disposing of everything at the end of the method I'd be safe, but it doesn't seem to help.  Furthermore, the interval between run-time and the OutOfMemoryException isn't constant; once it happened only a few seconds in, but usually it takes a minute or two.  Here are some class-wide variable declarations.</p>

<pre><code>    private Bitmap _backBuffer;

    private float startAngle = -91F;
    private float brushWidth = 14;
    private float spaceStep = 6;

Or maybe all the <code>img</code> elements in their relative grid matrix somehow being all scaled at once (this seems a bit unlikely). Maybe it's lots of <code>canvas</code> elements.. or one big <code>canvas</code> element (which we also doubt after a reasonable amount of testing).

<p>You may be lucky, that the main frame is just a simple container and you can ""replace"" it with your own container. But I not too optimistic. I don't think, that the editor has an API that allows integrating the internal frames into another container. So Option 3 would be the best but I think it's out of reach. Is it a common editor?

  Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession();
  session.beginTransaction();
  List&lt;Application&gt; applications = session.createQuery(""from Application a where a.project_id="" + project_id + "" "").list();

<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Although I have a lot of experience in database development, I'm having a hard time conceptualizing linking relationships in Core Data. As I understand it, the many relationship is an NSSet attached to the one file. After reading the documentation, I've understood part of it and gotten it to work in the first import in my code below.</p>

<p>I have a data model into which I perform two separate imports using the XMLParser. The first import loads Events and Categories from the same XML file within the same import like so:</p>

<pre><code>if (thisTagIsForOneTable) {
            // Insert object for the one-entity (Events)
    self.eventsObject = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@""Events"" inManagedObjectContext:xmlManagedObjectContext];
    return;
}   

if (thisTagIsForManyTable) {
            // Insert object for many-entity (EventCategories)
    self.categoriesObject = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@""EventCategories"" inManagedObjectContext:xmlManagedObjectContext];
    return;
}

    ......
    // Set attribute values depending upon whether the tag is for the one-entity or the many-entity.
[self.xxxObject setValue:trimmedString forKey:attributeName];
    ......

    // Set the relationship. This works great!
if (thisTagIsForManyTable) {
    NSMutableSet *manyRecordSet = [self.eventsObject  mutableSetValueForKey:@""categories""]; // My relationship name.
    [manyRecordSet addObject:self.categoriesObject];

    }

    // Save the context. Voila.
</code></pre>

<p>The above works fine. The second import loads EventLocations separately in a different part of the application so I need to set it's to-one relationship to Events. This is where I'm not too sure. Should the steps be?</p>

<pre><code>// Step A) Create (insert) new EventLocations object.
    self.eventLocationsObject = [NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@""EventLocations"" inManagedObjectContext:xmlManagedObjectContext];



    // Step B) Locate and get a reference to the the related one-entity's object (Events) by ID?  I have a custom class for Events. 
   // This seems to work but I'm taking a performance hit and getting a compiler warning below. The method returnObjectForEntity does a query and returns an NSManagedObject. Is this correct?
    Events *event = (Events *)[self returnObjectForEntity:@""Events"" withID:[oneRecordObject valueForKey:@""infIDCode""]];


    // Step C) Set the relationship to the Events entity. 
if (event) {

    [event addLocationsObject:self.eventLocationsObject];

        // Compiler warning: incompatible Objective-C types 'struct NSManagedObject *', expected 'struct EventLocations *' when passing argument 1 of 'addLocationsObject:' from distinct Objective-C type


}
    // Save the context.
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not too sure about steps B and C. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

To Speed things up you could create a cache (NSDictionary) with all Events and their @""infIDCode"" as Keys before starting the import. This would speed things up as long as you can make sure no Events are added/deleted/changed within the import phase.</p>

<p>Step C: 
self.eventLocationsObject should probably be declared as EventLocations*.</p>

<p>In general your import should work this way </p>

"
"3672803","<p>I am looking for a property in a font file (either from WPF's <code>System.Windows.Media.Fonts</code> <code>Typeface</code> or <code>GlyphTypeface</code>) or directly accessing the .ttf/.otf file that will allow me to determine if a program like Write/WordPad in Windows will apply Bold to the font. Basically, some fonts that have the Bold attribute will still get an extra boldness applied to them and some won't. I'm trying to discover what the logic is that is used to make this determination.</p>

<p>To manually see this, copy and the paste the following into Write/WordPad (or OOo's Writer or MS Word or...) and change each line's font face to it's name (i.e. apply Arial Black to Arial Black)</p>

<ol>
<li>Arial Black</li>
<li>Arial Rounded MT Bold</li>
<li>Arial Narrow</li>
</ol>

<p>Now apply bold to them. You'll see #2 and #3 change, but not #1.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With #3 though, something different is
  happening than the other two - a
  different font all together is being
  applied. Namely <em>ARIALNB .TTF</em> ('NB'
  appended, which is <em>Arial Narrow
  Bold</em>) in place of <em>ARIALN.TTF</em> ('N'
  appended, which is <em>Arial Narrow</em>). So
  in the case of this font, bold is not
  actually being applied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Back to the list. #1 doesn't change, but #2 does. #1's weight is ""Black"" and #2's is ""Bold"". If you were to take the Bold version of #3, <em>ARIALNB.TTF</em>, and apply bold to it, it would act like #1 - it wouldn't change. But it has the same weight as #2, that of ""Bold"".</p>

<p>In other words, two are bold (Arial Rounded MT Bold and Arrow Narrow Bold), but only Arial Rounded MT Bold gets more bold applied. In the case of Arial Black, it doesn't have a Bold weight, but it still doesn't have a bold applied to it either.</p>

<p>Here's what it looks like:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/AMKue.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Interestingly, WPF doesn't exhibit this behavior (i.e adding more bold), but Silverlight does:</p>

<h3>WPF <sub>(Note the FontFamily is ""Arial Rounded MT""):</sub></h3>

<pre><code>&lt;StackPanel Orientation=""Vertical""&gt;
    &lt;TextBlock FontSize=""24"" Text=""Arial Rounded MT Bold"" FontFamily=""Arial Rounded MT""/&gt;
    &lt;TextBlock FontSize=""24"" Text=""Arial Rounded MT Bold"" FontWeight=""Black"" FontFamily=""Arial Rounded MT""/&gt;
&lt;/StackPanel&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>Silverlight <sub>(Note the FontFamily is ""Arial Rounded MT Bold""):</sub></h3>

<pre><code>&lt;StackPanel Orientation=""Vertical""&gt;
    &lt;TextBlock  FontSize=""24"" FontFamily=""Arial Rounded MT Bold"" &gt;Arial Rounded MT Bold&lt;/TextBlock&gt;
    &lt;TextBlock  FontSize=""24"" FontFamily=""Arial Rounded MT Bold"" FontWeight=""Bold"" &gt;Arial Rounded MT Bold&lt;/TextBlock&gt;
&lt;/StackPanel&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The question comes back to: <em>What property of a font file tells a program to add more bold or not?</em> I'm seeking a flag or a property within the font file that will tell me this logic.</p>

<p>Here's a list of other fonts where applying ""Bold"" has no effect:
<sub>
 - Adobe Caslon Pro Bold
 - Adobe Garamond Pro Bold
 - Andy
 - Arial Black
 - Bell Gothic Std Black
 - Bell Gothic Light Black
 - Berlin Sans FB Demi
 - Blackoak Std
 - Bodoni MT Black
 - Charlemagne Std

<p>that render the following box on Chrome (without the red rectangle)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/eqRJU.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I would like to add an hyperlink just in the place of the red rectangle. How can I do it?</p>

<p>Please note that all the used styles are inline and the classes are all from jquery UI standard classes. I am not a designer and maybe this markup can be optimized. Any advice is welcomed... :)</p>

<p>Note that you should give the box a definite size; you can't have it ""grow"" by itself. <code>width: 100%;</code> is ok, though.</p>

<p>Also note that this <code>div</code> doesn't extend the size of the parent <code>div</code>. If the accordion is too small, then the last entry will overlap with your link. The solution is to add an empty <code>div</code> with the necessary height to accordion to make room for the absolutely positioned one.</p>

"3675041","<p>Greetings all,</p>

<p>This is going to be a long question,skip the [Background] if its not that neccasary  ;)</p>

<p><strong>[Background</strong>]</p>

<p>I am developing a modular QT based application.Application is extentible via QT based plugins.
As shown in the figure, there are mainly 3 parts .(numbers in red)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/FYnDE.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>1) <strong>libAppCore</strong> - the core of the application,which defines pluginterfaces,main UIS,interations..etc</p>

<p>2) <strong>App.exe</strong>     - the applicatoin which implement some builtin plugins and main application execution.</p>

<p>3) <strong>Qt based plugins</strong> - several plugins which implements Plugin interfaces in <code>libAppCore.dll</code></p>

<p>Here's how each components links each other:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>libAppCore  links QT libraries.</p></li>
<li><p>App.exe links libAppCore.DLL and QT libraries (App.exe uses someother QT Classes not being used my libAppCore.DLL)</p></li>
<li><p>Plugins (libAppQTPluginA.DLL , libAppQTPluginB.DLL ) - link libAppCore.DLL and QT libs.
libAppQTPluginA.DLL - links OpenGL
libAppQTPluginB.DLL - links VTK libraries</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>[Actual Problem ; ] Again only occurs in Windows , works fine in Linux.</strong></p>

<p>Everything compiles fine and I have only problem wihen executing the PluginB , which uses VTK libraries.</p>

<p>During executing PluginB , it creates a QWidget which set as central widget in a QMainWindow.(there can be many QMainWindow's at once)
Inside this QWidget  I create a QVTWidget and create a dummy sphere as follows,</p>

<p>QVTKWidget qtWidget = new QVTKWidget(this);
 qtWidget->resize(512, 512);</p>

<p>vtkSmartPointer sphereSource = vtkSmartPointer::New();
 sphereSource->Update();
 vtkSmartPointer sphereMapper = vtkSmartPointer::New();
 sphereMapper->SetInputConnection(sphereSource->GetOutputPort());
 vtkSmartPointer sphereActor = vtkSmartPointer::New();
 sphereActor->SetMapper(sphereMapper);</p>

<p>// VTK Renderer
 vtkSmartPointer leftRenderer =vtkSmartPointer::New();
 leftRenderer->AddActor(sphereActor);</p>

<p>qtWidget->GetRenderWindow()->AddRenderer(leftRenderer);
 QVBoxLayout *vboxLayout = new QVBoxLayout;
 vboxLayout->addWidget(qtWidget);
 setLayout(vboxLayout);</p>

<p>During execution QT warns about multiple threads ,but I never create any new threads nor VTK (AFAIK).</p>

<pre><code>QObject: Cannot create children for a parent that is in a different thread.(Parent is QObject(0xdbe0d70), parent's thread is QThread(0x3370f8), current thread is QThread(0xdc427f8)
</code></pre>

<p>(But when I comment out the line  vboxLayout->addWidget(qtWidget);  this disappears. )</p>

<p>And when I perforce any operation on QVTKWidget ,application crash .Error log is</p>

"3675135","<p>How would you structure the below page in Codeigniter?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/7vHtF.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I thought about creating seperate controllers for each section</p>

<ol>
<li>Left nav</li>
<li>Content nav</li>
<li>Login name</li>
<li>Leaderboard</li>
</ol>

<p>Excluding the content section (as this changes depending on the link on the left nav and content nav used as a kinda sub-menu). All the other sections remain roughly the same</p>

<p>I thought about doing:</p>

<pre><code>Class User_Profile extends Controller
{

    function index()
    {
        $this-&gt;load_controller('Left_Nav');
        $this-&gt;load_controller('Content_Nav');
        $this-&gt;load_controller('Login_Name');
        $this-&gt;load_controller('Leaderboard', 'Board');

        $this-&gt;Left_Nav-&gt;index(array('highlight_selected_page' =&gt; 'blah'));

        $this-&gt;load('User');

        $content_data = $this-&gt;User-&gt;get_profile_details();

        $this-&gt;view-&gt;load('content', $content_data);

        $this-&gt;Login_Name-&gt;index();
        $this-&gt;Board-&gt;index();
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this <code>load_controller</code> does not exist but this functionaility would be useful. The controller for each section gets the data required from the model and then loads the page through <code>$this-&gt;view-&gt;load()</code></p>

<p>It could be a headache to have this code in all the left nav links like News, Users, About Us, etc.. But then again not every nav link has all those sections so I need that flexability of having the sections as a ""partial view""</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest a better way of doing this?</p>
","Codeigniter: Best way to structure partial views","<php><design-patterns><codeigniter>","2010-09-09 08:58:59","58175","3675485","7","<p>I can't vouch that this is the best approach, but I create a base controller like this:</p>

<pre><code>class MY_Controller extends CI_Controller {

    public $title = '';
    // The template will use this to include default.css by default
    public $styles = array('default');

    function _output($content)
    {
        // Load the base template with output content available as $content
        $data['content'] = &amp;$content;
        $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('base', $data);
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>The view called 'base' is a template (a view that includes other views):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php echo doctype(); ?&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;?php $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('meta'); ?&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;div id=""wrapper""&gt;
            &lt;?php $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('header'); ?&gt;

            &lt;div id=""content""&gt;
                &lt;?php echo $content; ?&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;?php $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('footer'); ?&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What this achieves is that every controller wraps its output in the base template, and that views have valid HTML instead of opening tags in one view and closing in another. If I'd like a specific controller to use a different or no template, I could just override the magic <code>_output()</code> method.</p>

<p>An actual controller would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Home extends MY_Controller {

    // Override the title
    public $title = 'Home';

    function __construct()
    {
        // Append a stylesheet (home.css) to the defaults
        $this-&gt;styles[] = 'home';
    }

    function index()
    {
        // The output of this view will be wrapped in the base template
        $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('home');
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I could use its properties in my views like this (this is the 'meta' view that populates the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element):</p>

<pre><code>echo ""&lt;title&gt;{$this-&gt;title}&lt;/title&gt;"";
foreach ($this-&gt;styles as $url)
    echo link_tag(""styles/$url.css"");
</code></pre>

<p>I like my approach because it respects the DRY principle and the header, footer and other elements get included just once in the code.</p>

"3675538","<p>my image processing project works with grayscale images. I have ARM Cortex-A8 processor platform. I want to make use of the NEON.</p>

<p>How can I load <strong>four 8-bit pixel values</strong> in parallel, which are <strong>uint8_t</strong>, as <strong>four uint32_t</strong> into one of the 128-bit NEON registers? What intrinsic do I have to use to do this?</p>

<p>iOS SDK 4.0 is gone in this release, replaced by iOS SDK 4.1. Details in ""The Explanation"" below. (NB: this repeats some information in my <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3161385"">previous Q/A</a> regarding 3.2.3).</p>

<h1>The Fix</h1>

<p>To fix this specific problem, you need to reset the Base SDK for your target(s), etc. You can either do that for the entire project (most folks), or for each target and/or configuration which applies. Rarely, you might need to do both. </p>

<h2>Edit Project Settings</h2>

<ol>
<li>Load your project</li>
<li>From the menu, select Project > Edit Project Settings...</li>
<li>Click the ""Build"" tab.</li>
<li>Under ""Configurations"" select ""All Configurations"".</li>
<li>Go to the <strong>Change Base SDK</strong> section below.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Edit Specific Target/Configuration Settings</h2>

<ol>
<li>Load your project</li>
<li>From the menu, select Project > Active Target > ""YourTarget""</li>
<li>From the menu, select Project > Edit Active Target ""YourTarget""</li>
<li>Click the ""Build"" tab.</li>
<li>Under ""Configurations"" select ""All Configurations"", or the Configuration you want.</li>
<li>Go to the <strong>Change Base SDK</strong> section below.</li>
</ol>

<p></p>

<h2>Change Base SDK</h2>

<ol>
<li>Under Architecture > Base SDK, choose one of the available device
options: iOS Device 3.2 or iOS Device 4.1. If you are iPhone-only, 4.1 is the way to go.</li>
<li>If you want to target previous iOS versions, then in that same
window, under Deployment > iPhone OS Deployment Target, select the
lowest version you want to support. Note that support for 2.x versions
through the app store is deprecated.</li>
</ol>

<h1>The Explanation</h1>

<p>iOS SDK 4.0 is gone in this release, replaced by iOS SDK 4.1. This is very similar with what happened with the 3.2.3 upgrade, which I covered in detail <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3161385"">here</a>. You can still use 3.2.4 to target iOS versions down to 3.0, but AFAIK, you must compile against the 4.1 SDK with Xcode 3.2.4. If this statement confuses you, study the following sentence closely:</p>

<p><em>The iOS SDK you compile against -- the ""Base SDK"" -- does not downward limit what iOS versions you can support.</em></p>

<p>In fact, there are two different settings, cf. <strong>Change Base SDK</strong> above. If you remain confused, take heart, and read my <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3161385"">detailed post</a> on the previous switchover, which is itself chockablock with links to good stuff.</p>

Because if so, there is no UTF-8 in the problem. Strings at the web browser side are purely Unicode-based; it's only when you're moving them from the browser to the server or back that encoding matters come into play.</p>

<p>My guess would be a simple font problem. Clearly from your screenshot, Firefox is using a different font to IE, and perhaps that font is one without proper support for features necessary to Arabic like the contextual ligatures that take care of choosing the right glyph variant of each character. Check the stylesheets and use Firebug if necessary to find out what font is being applied to that input.</p>

<pre><code>accept-charset=""utf-8""

<p>is basically no use, because IE handles it wrong. It uses UTF-8 as a fallback encoding (for characters that don't fit in the page's current charset) instead of the <em>only</em> encoding.</p>

<p>To get a form that submits in UTF-8, you must ensure that the page containing the form is served as <code>text/html;charset=utf-8</code> using a <code>Content-Type</code> header and/or <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag.</p>

","Adjusting navigationItem.titleView's frame?","<iphone><uinavigationitem>","2010-09-10 02:52:57","51939","4925776","13","<p>Sometime in between your view controller's viewWillAppear: &amp; viewDidAppear:, the navigation bar is repositioning your titleView and resizing it to fit if necessary. It can end up uncentered because the navigation bar is prefering not to resize your titleView to fit between the buttons. It seems to try to center the title view if it's small enough, but if not will move your titleView off-center, and then I think only as last resort will resize. The effect is that the titleView is taking up all the space between the two buttons, if its textAlignment is centered then it will centered in <em>that</em> space though not the centered with respect to the whole screen. You can see this in your screen shot.</p>

<p>One answer is to make your titleView narrower so the navigation bar can center it, so try about 160 instead of 180 when you set your titleView.frame. It sucks that, when creating the view programmatically like you are, one has to put an estimate for that width into the code. What would be good is a way to maximize that space while staying centered.</p>

<p>It's possible to start with the titleView being the screen width, then after the navigation bar changes titleView.frame, update it again yourself in the view controller's viewDidAppear:. Using its adjusted titleView.frame.origin.x and size.width along with the screen width, you can calculate the largest of the left &amp; right margins, then set the origin.x to that, the size.width to the screen width minus that times 2. However that doesn't take effect until after the pushed view has animated in and the shift afterwards is visible. You could hide the titleView in viewWillAppear: then unhide in viewDidAppear: after centering it, so instead of sliding in with an off-center titleView which is then shifted, it would slide in with no title which then appears.</p>

<p>A better possibility is to make your titleView your own subclass of UIView (or UILabel or whichever) and override setFrame to resize itself to stay centered in its superview. If I ever end up doing this myself I'll post it here. Or maybe someone else knows another place to change the titleView's frame after its been updated but before the view slides in without a view subclass.</p>

","UISlider with certain possible values","<iphone><uislider>","2010-09-10 03:06:25","934","3684095","2","<p>Personally I'd use a standard UISlider and add logic to the valueChanged handler, so that once the user has dragged the slider to an arbitrary point on the scale, the code determines which is the nearest 'valid' value, and would manually set the value to a valid number.</p>

<p>E.g. if the user drags the slider to 0.9, the distances to valid points are 0.9 (to A), 0.4 (to B) and 0.1 (to C). So the code would pick C, and set slider.value to 1.0. Can't remember off-hand if you could animate that property, but you probably can. That would look much nicer to the user.</p>

<p>For visuals, I'd create a container class that holds a UISlider, and a UILabel for each valid value. Arranging those labels along the scale underneath the slider according to their positions isn't too hard. With suitable auto-resizing, the control should still look correct no matter how you change the shape of the container view.</p>

<p>For polish, I'd probably also tweak the font for the 'selected' label to bold it or something else to make it doubly obvious that the item has been selected.</p>

<p>to define a custom UIColor with values for red, green and blue, and set it to the background color of your ImageView:</p>

<pre><code>imageView.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithRed:0.5 green:0.0 blue:1 alpha:1.0];
</code></pre>

<p>Take a look at <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1354811/how-can-i-take-an-uiimage-and-give-it-a-black-border"">this question</a> regarding adding a border to the view.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT (Question clarified somewhat)</strong></p>

<p>It looks like you're trying to display an image that has a portion coloured at runtime. </p>

<p>To do this, create the image as a png, and leave the parts you want to be filled with the color transparent. You can then set the background color of the UIImageView to the violet approximation, and set the image property to the image you created.</p>

<p>Note that Violet is outside the color gamut of the RGB colour space, so you'll need to find the RGB values of the color you want. Also note this function takes values between 0 and 1 rather than 0 and 255.</p>

"3684951","<p>I've encountered a strange feature (that may be related to SQL Management Studio) with regard to the placement of return characters at the end of SQL Statements. Whilst the query runs just fine within the ID, the feature in question was breaking our deployment scripts.</p>

<p>Essentially, for some reason, certain lines were being terminated by what looked like a Carriage Return (CR) instead of a CRLF, as can be seen in the diff between two files below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/1yUbh.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Now I know how to modify the build scripts to catch this, but I was curious as to how this was being caused. How on earth would a CR character be used in place of a CRLF character?</p>

<p>Thoughts anyone?</p>

"3685161","<p>How do you change the behavior of a <code>QListWidget</code> so that it resizes its height instead of choosing a (seemingly arbitrary) height and adding scrollbars? See screenshot:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/bp6o8.png"" alt=""screen shot""></p>

<p>The <code>QListView</code>'s should fill up as much space horizontally as they can (creating as many ""columns,"" if you will.) Then they wrap and make as many rows as necessary to fit all the items. These calculations should be adjusted as the window is resized. This is all working fine.</p>

<p>However, what I <em>want</em> to happen is that instead of the height staying the same, the <code>QListView</code> should grow or shrink vertically and never need any scrollbars. The scrolling, if necessary, will be handled on the parent <code>QWidget</code> that hosts all of the labels and lists. It seems like once the height of the <code>QListWidget</code> is established (not sure where its default is coming from), it never changes. It is too big in some cases (see second ""Test"" list above) and too small in others (see first ""blank maps"" list above.)</p>

<p>The layout above is nothing surprising: two <code>QLabel</code>'s and two <code>QListWidget</code>'s in a <code>QVBoxLayout.</code> Here are the properties I have set on the <code>QListWidget</code>'s: </p>

<pre><code>setMovement(QListView::Static);
setResizeMode(QListView::Adjust);
setViewMode(QListView::IconMode);
setIconSize(QSize(128, 128));
</code></pre>

<p>(I already tried setting the horizontal and vertical scrollbar policies,  but that just turns the scrollbars off, clipping the content. Not what I want.)</p>

"3686538","<p>I'm having the following problem, and would love some pointers in the right direction.
To put things simple:</p>

<p>I information from a table, with PHP, that I put inside a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> tag.
Whenever I click one of the options (lines) present it should load/show certain information on a cell that is right next to it. If I click another one of the options it should show different information (loaded from a database).</p>

<p>Like this:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/x0PtF.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Click on a category, show information. Actually I'm supposed to have on the second cell another sub-category, but I believe that If I can get this first step solved then it will be a matter of applying it to the 2nd/3rd cells.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
I am also considering using a frame inside that cell, a php document, that reloads everytime the user clicks on one of the options. Is that viable as well?</p>

<p>The above example is done using jQuery (altough you can do it using any js library or plain javascript).</p>

<p>The code says that when ever there is a change in the selected value of the category, do an ajax call to <code>url-to-fetch</code> passing in the selected value and then show the details in <code>problem</code> area (assuming problem is the id of the textarea).</p>

<p>I don't know what font the first Hello world! is but it's weird. It's weird because the default font on my Safari is Times New Roman. I have checked. Also, it's not in conflict with any other style because I have tried it by itself and the problem persists.</p>

<p>As Safari 4.0 final was released in 2009, and the current stable release of Safari is 5,  it's very likely that there was a problem in Safari 4 beta's font rendering code.</p>

<p>If you have a font installed, there's no way in browsers that support CSS correctly (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, later versions of IE) to say ""fallback to the next font even if you see that I have the first font installed"".

<p>A few other notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Lucida Console is not installed on most Macs, so if you're trying to be cross-platform, you need to provide a fallback (like <code>monospace</code>).</li>

<p>I have 3 Buttons add,delete,open as <strong>RelayCommands</strong> in my <strong>DocumentViewModel</strong>.
Below you see how I have bound them. Of course those binding does not work, because the data is set to the <strong>ItemsSource</strong> of the <strong>ListBox</strong> and the buttons are <strong>outside</strong> of that...</p>

<p>What I tried then is to set the DataContext at the first StackPanel you see in my code snippet.</p>

<p>like this: <code>&lt;StackPanel DataContext=""{Binding DocumentViewModelList}"" &gt;</code></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>I tried this</strong>:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;Button Command=""{Binding Path=DeleteDocumentCommand, RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type DocumentViewModel}}}""
</code></pre>

<p><strong>and got this</strong>: The type reference cannot find a public type named 'DocumentViewModel'</p>

<p>I would like to stick with the StackPanel DataContext solution and make somehow the ListBox.ItemsSource grabbing the DocumentViewModelList via RelativeSource binding with FindAncestor. I tried some things but no luck, maybe someone can post a nice snippet :)</p>

<p>OK I found the solution: <code>&lt;ListBox ItemsSource=""{Binding}"" ..</code>.</p>

<p>this is binding to the current DataContext that is ""DocumentViewModelList"" cool!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>

<p>ok there is still another problem, maybe if someone can provide a solution on this I mark this thread as a solution then. Do not want to open a new thread, because the whole text+code snippet is the same... Problem now is =>Selecting The 1st Document activates the Button. Selecting any other Button does not activate a Button, WHY? What is wrong with the binding of my IsSelected property ? </p>

<p>DocumentViewModel.cs:</p>

<pre><code>private bool _isSelected;
        public bool IsSelected 
        {
            get { return _isSelected; }
            set
            {
                if (_isSelected == value)
                    return;

                _isSelected = value;
                this.RaisePropertyChanged(""IsSelected"");
            }
        }  
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong></p>

<p>This is the code for enabling the buttons: What do I wrong? I get no binding errors in the output console!?</p>

<pre><code>private void DeleteDocument()
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }

        private bool CanDeleteDocument()
        {
            return (IsSelected == true);
        }

        private void AddDocument()
        { 

        }

        private void OpenDocument()
        { 

        }

        public RelayCommand DeleteDocumentCommand
        {
            get { return _deleteDocumentCommand ?? (_deleteDocumentCommand = new RelayCommand(() =&gt; DeleteDocument(), () =&gt; CanDeleteDocument())); }
        }

        {

        {
            get { return _openDocumentCommand ?? (_openDocumentCommand = new RelayCommand(() =&gt; OpenDocument())); }

","WPF buttons are outside the datacontext and could not be bound","<wpf><binding><controls><datacontext>","2010-09-11 18:54:01","703","3692408","1","<p>Is the <code>DocumentViewModelList</code> a property of your <code>DocumentViewModel</code>?</p>

<p>Typically, what I would have is a ViewModel for that window which would expose an <code>ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;</code> where <code>T</code> is what you want displayed in the list.  Then, you can assign the Window/Page/etc.'s <code>DataContext</code> to the ViewModel, and then bind the <code>ItemsSource</code> of the <code>ListBox</code> to that <code>ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;</code> property.</p>

<p>For example, here would be a snippet of my ViewModel.</p>

<pre><code>public class SomeViewModel
{
  public ObservableCollection&lt;SingleDocumentViewModel&gt; Docs {get; private set; }

  // other properties can go here
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the code-behind for the XAML, (I usually do it in the constructor), you can set its <code>DataContext</code> to a new instance of your ViewModel</p>

<pre><code>public AwesomeDocumentList()
{
  this.DataContext = new SomeViewModel();
  // the rest of the constructor
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the Window's DataContext set, you can bind the <code>ItemsSource</code> to the exposed property (I called it <code>Docs</code>)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListBox ItemsSource=""{Binding Docs}"" ... /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>In the <code>RelayCommand</code> for the button, do you have something specified for the <code>CanExecute</code> predicate?  If not, then I believe the <code>RelayCommand</code> will default to always enabled.  But if you have a predicate specified, take a look in there.</p>

<p>The code you posted for the <code>IsSelected</code> property looks fine.  Looks like the problem lies elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Matplotlib installation procedure</h2>

<p>I installed matplotlib by cloning <a href=""http://github.com/astraw/matplotlib"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">astraw's matplotlib github repository</a> and then loosely following <a href=""http://blog.hyperjeff.net/?p=160"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HyperJeff's Installation Instructions for numpy/scipy/matplotlib</a>. Below are the potentially relevant sections of <code>setup.cfg</code> and <code>make.osx</code>, including the sections that I modified prior to compiling and installing.</p>

<h3>setup.cfg</h3>

<pre><code>[egg_info]

<p>After modifying <code>setup.cfg</code> and <code>make.osx</code>, I issued the following commands to install matplotlib:</p>

<pre><code>make -f make.osx fetch deps mpl_build mpl_install
python setup.py install

<p><em>Note:</em> <code>sudo</code> isn't required, since I'm installing into a virtualenv instead of into the site-packages like HyperJeff is doing.</p>

<h2>Python Installation</h2>

<p>I installed Python 2.7 using python.org's <em>Python 2.7 PPC/i386/x86-64 Mac OS X Installer Disk Image for Mac OS X 10.5</em>. Thanks to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3472349/what-are-the-differences-between-the-two-python-2-7-mac-os-x-disk-image-installer/3472625#3472625"">Ned Deily's answer to this SO question</a>, I know that this version of Python 2.7 cannot run IDLE or Tkinter on Mac OS X 10.6.</p>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<ol>
<li>Could the version of Python 2.7 that I have installed be the cause of the problem? Should I reinstall Python 2.7 using the <em>Python 2.7 32-bit Mac OS X Installer Disk Image for Mac OS X 10.3 through 10.6</em>?</li>
<li>Is there a different <code>gui_support</code> option that I need to configure in <code>setup.cfg</code> and then recompile matplotlib?</li>
</ol>

"3692987","<p>I'm trying to get the Layout of a <code>JDialog</code> of mine to fit a particular look that a program in which I'm porting to Java has, I've used several LayoutManagers before with great success yet for some reason I cannot seem to get this working at all. My goal is to have the Right (East) side of the <code>JDialog</code> contain a ""Find Next"" and ""Cancel"" button in a top-down order and then any extra space below so that the two buttons are always at the top of the <code>JDialog</code>, yet for some reason <code>BoxLayout</code> is continously ignoring any attempts at changing (this is where I'm lost) the width of a <code>JButton</code>. Code follows.  </p>

<pre><code>JButton findNext = new JButton(""Find Next"");
JButton cancel = new JButton(""Cancel"");
cancel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension((int)findNext.getPreferredSize().getWidth(),  
    (int)cancel.getPreferredSize().getHeight()));

JPanel example = new JPanel();  
example.setLayout(new BoxLayout(example, BoxLayout.Y_AXIS));  
example.add(findNext);
example.add(cancel);  
example.add(Box.createGlue());  
</code></pre>  

<p>No matter what I try, <code>cancel</code> always retains it's normal size. I've tried <code>setMinimumSize()</code> and <code>setMaximumSize()</code> with the same parameters as <code>setPreferredSize</code> with no luck. I've even tried <code>cancel.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(500, 500));</code> and the buttons height was the only thing adjusted, it STILL retained the default width it was given.  </p>

<p>To clear up any questions, here is what it looks like (now that I've finished it) and you'll see that the ""Find Next"" and ""Cancel"" buttons are not the same size.</p>

So for the sake of searchers that stumble upon this I will add my two cents.</p>

<p>There are three methods associated with sizing components in Swing: setPreferredSize(), setMinimumSize(), and setMaximumSize(). However, the important point is that it is up to the particular layout manager being used as to whether or not it honors any of these methods.</p>

<p>For BoxLayout (the layout the original poster is using):</p>

<ul>
<li>setMinimumSize() -- <code>BoxLayout</code> honors this</li>
<li>setMaximumSize() -- <code>BoxLayout</code> honors this</li>
<li>setPreferredSize() --  if X_AXIS is being used width is honored, if Y_AXIS is being used height is honored</li>
</ul>

<p>The OP is using a Y_AXIS BoxLayout which is why only his height was being changed.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I put together a page with this same information for all of the layout managers.

<pre><code>before_create :set_structure_type_fk

def set_structure_type_fk
  self.structure_type = StructureType.find_by_name(\ 
      self.class.name.gsub(/Structure/, '').downcase)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Note that this approach means that StructureType.name should be immutable: once created it should never be changed, except by a database migration that updates both tables correspondingly.</p>

"3696351","<p>I recently took all my code a manually imported it into an eclipse project from BlueJ, I then got use to the settings up ""Run Configurations"", finally thinking I was home free. Then I ran the code, and I got this error</p>

<pre><code>java.lang.NoSuchMethodError: main
Exception in thread ""main"" 
</code></pre>

<p>so I figured I had to add a main method (I never had to do this in BlueJ, why?). So I did that just called the constructor method (in BlueJ I would just create a new object and the JFrame would show). So I did that, same error. After trying different things (such as moving the code in the constructor to a different method etc.). I just put this in for the main method:</p>

<pre><code>public void main(String[] args)
{
    System.out.println(""Hello, this is main why won't Java find this."");
}
</code></pre>

<p>After that I still got the same error, so I then decided to add it to all my classes to make sure it wasn't using another class as the main class. Still same error, so I come to you wondering if any of you have encountered this problem. Also I did search Google and all I found was problems with <code>private</code> classes etc and sense all my classes are <code>public</code> (hey I come from Python :) ). I knew that wasn't the problem. Help Please :)</p>

<p>You may be wondering why there is a <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> argument for the processing function, but if the image is not exactly divisible by 64, then there will be smaller chunks at the edge of the image (right-hand side and the bottom). See this image for a better understanding what I mean (red chunks are the chunks that will have &lt;64 <em>width</em> or <em>height</em> arguments).</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Using the on-board implementations of <code>GrantedAuthorities</code>, <code>UserDetailsService</code> and <code>UserDetailsmanager</code>, everything is fine. However, I am not satisfied with the JDBC implementation of Spring and would like to write my own ones. In order to do so, I tried to create a representation of the relations by following business objects:</p>

<p>The user entity:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Table(name = ""users"", uniqueConstraints = {@UniqueConstraint(columnNames = {""username""})})
public class AppUser implements UserDetails, CredentialsContainer {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = -8275492272371421013L;

    @Column(name = ""credentialsNonExpired"")
    private Boolean credentialsNonExpired;

    @OneToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = ""personalinformation_fk"", nullable = true)
    @JsonIgnore
    private PersonalInformation personalInformation;

    @Column(name = ""enabled"", nullable = false)
    @NotNull
    private Boolean enabled;

    public AppUser(
            String username,
            String password,
            boolean enabled,
            boolean accountNonExpired,
            boolean credentialsNonExpired,

            Collection&lt;? extends AppAuthority&gt; authorities,
            PersonalInformation personalInformation
    ) {
        if (((username == null) || """".equals(username)) || (password == null)) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Cannot pass null or empty values to constructor"");
        }

        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
        this.enabled = enabled;
        this.accountNonExpired = accountNonExpired;
        this.credentialsNonExpired = credentialsNonExpired;
        this.accountNonLocked = accountNonLocked;
        this.appAuthorities = Collections.unmodifiableSet(sortAuthorities(authorities));
        this.personalInformation = personalInformation;
    }

    public AppUser() {
    }

    @JsonIgnore
    public PersonalInformation getPersonalInformation() {
        return personalInformation;
    }

    @JsonIgnore
    public void setPersonalInformation(PersonalInformation personalInformation) {
        this.personalInformation = personalInformation;
    }

    // Getters, setters 'n other stuff
</code></pre>

<p>And the authority entity as an implementation of GrantedAuthorities:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
@Table(name = ""authorities"", uniqueConstraints = {@UniqueConstraint(columnNames = {""id""})})
public class AppAuthority implements GrantedAuthority, Serializable {
    //~ Instance fields ================================================================================================

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.TABLE)
    @Column(name = ""id"", nullable = false)
    private Integer id;

    @Column(name = ""username"", nullable = false)
    private String username;

    @Column(name = ""authority"", nullable = false)
    private String authority;

    // Here comes the buggy attribute. It is supposed to repesent the
    // association username&lt;-&gt;username, but I just don't know how to
    // implement it 
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER, cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
    @JoinColumn(name = ""appuser_fk"")
    private AppUser appUser;

    //~ Constructors ===================================================================================================

    public AppAuthority(String username, String authority) {
        Assert.hasText(authority,
                ""A granted authority textual representation is required"");
        this.username = username;
        this.authority = authority;
    }

    public AppAuthority() {
    }

    // Getters 'n setters 'n other stuff
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is the <code>@ManyToOne</code> assoc. of <code>AppAuthorities</code>: It is supposed to be ""username"", but trying and doing so throws an error, because I've got to typify that attribute as <code>String</code> ... while Hibernate expects the associated entity. So what I tryied is actually providing the correct entity and creating the association by <code>@JoinColumn(name = ""appuser_fk"")</code>. This is, of course, rubbish, because in order to load the User, I will have the foreign key in <code>username</code>, while Hibernate searches for it in <code>appuser_fk</code>, which will always be empty.</p>

<p>So here is my question: any suggestion on how to modify the above metioned code in order to get a correct JPA2 implementation of the data model?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>But the better practice is to decouple your domain model from Spring Security. When you have a custom <code>UserDetailsService</code>, you don't need to mimic neither Spring Security's default database schema nor its object model. Your <code>UserDetailsService</code> can load your own <code>AppUser</code> and <code>AppAuthority</code> and then create <code>UserDetails</code> and <code>GrantedAuthority</code>s based on them. This leads to cleaner design with better separation of concerns.</p>

"3697293","<p>I'm trying to add a <code>ContextMenu</code> in a particular cell of a <code>DataGridView</code>. Like the image below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/N83Pw.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

{
    foreach (Control control in this.Controls)
    {
        // Add KeyDown event to each control in the form.

{
    Control ctrl = (Control)sender;
    if (e.KeyData == Keys.F1) // Check if F1 is being pressed.
    {
        if (ctrl.GetType() == typeOf(TextBox)) // Check if the control is a TextBox
        {
            ToolStripControlHost lblInfo;
            label1.Text = ""This context menu is for TextBoxes."";
            lblInfo = new ToolStripControlHost(label1); // some Label 
            contextMenuStrip1.Items.Add(lblInfo);
            contextMenuStrip1.Show(ctrl, 0, 25); // Popups the contextMenu just below the textBox control.
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I just don't know how to do it in a particular cell of a DataGridView.
I tried experimenting on this code:</p>

<pre><code>if (ctrl.GetType() == typeOf(DataGridView)) // Check if the control is a DataGridView
{
    DataGridViewCell testCell = dataGridView1[dataGridView1.CurrentCell.ColumnIndex, dataGridView1.CurrentRow.Index]; // Returns DataGridViewCell type

    ToolStripControlHost lblInfo;
    label1.Text = ""test"";
    lblInfo = new ToolStripControlHost(label1); // some Label 
    contextMenuStrip1.Items.Add(lblInfo);
    contextMenuStrip1.Show(testCell, 0, 25);

<p>But i think ContextMenu only accepts a <code>Control</code> type on its first argument, and I got this exception: </p>

<pre><code>cannot convert from 'System.Windows.Forms.DataGridViewCell' to 'System.Windows.Forms.Control'

<p>Are there any workaround on this? Please advice me what to do.. thanks in advance.</p>

"3697468","<p>What is the largest set of seven-, fourteen-, or sixteen-segment LCD symbols such that</p>

<ul>
<li>all of the symbols are instantly recognizable as characters that can be typed on a standard US-ASCII keyboard;</li>
<li>if you take any subset of the symbol set and superimpose all its elements, that is also an instantly recognizable and typeable character;</li>
<li>all of the base symbols and all of the possible superimposition groups produce <em>distinct</em> characters.</li>
</ul>

<p>The best I've been able to do with a seven-segment alphabet is three: <img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/jTEGw.png"" alt=""54F 96A8""></p>

<p>No fair using characters that are meaningless out of context, e.g. the M and W from <a href=""http://www.twyman.org.uk/Fonts/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Harvey Twyman's seven segment font</a> are no good.</p>

<p>(Why would you want to do this?  Imagine a situation where you can superimpose symbols of your choice, and some of them are going to be invisible but you don't know which.  By using symbols from a set like this, and getting someone to look at the result, you can deduce which base symbols were invisible.)</p>
","Encoding golf: stack LCD characters to make other characters","<encoding>","2010-09-13 01:44:15","253","3697788","1","<p>One observation is that your rule about distinct characters means that the maximum number of segments that any symbol in your set can occupy is equal to N_segments - N_symbols + 1.  (And you can apply that recursively to the segments it doesn't occupy and the other symbols.)</p>

<p>The first corrolary of this is that, if you have a symbol of this maximum size, it must produce a legible symbol when you add any single extra segment.</p>

<p>The second corrolary of this is that, if you have a symbol of this maximum size, it also must produce a legible symbole when you add any combination of extra segments.</p>

<p>So, to beat your best of 3 for a 7-segment display, you can't use any symbols that occupy more than 4 segments.  The possiblities there that I can see are (1 segment) - and ' in multiple places, (2 segments) =, r, 1, (3 segments) n, u, c in two places each, L, J sans hook, 7 sans hook, (4 segments) h, 4, [, ], o in two places, F, J and L with hook, 7 with hook, and t.</p>

<p>Several of the four-segment ones fit the first corrolary -- 4 (if you allow adding the lower segment to count as a Y), F, L with hook, and t.  All but F fail the second corrolary when you make an upside-down A, and F fails because P and P-with-hook (add lower segment) are not distinct.</p>

<p>Thus, a set of four has to have a maximum symbol size of 3 segments.  A third corrolary, then: If two symbols combine to make a symbol of maximum size for a set of one fewer symbols, then that combination must fit the conditions of the first and second corrolaries.  That applies to all pairs of five segments, and rules out pairs of six segments.</p>

<p>Attacking from the other end, there's no way to combine the one- and two-segment sets to make a working set of three (- and ' can only make r, so that rules out r, and individually they don't work with = or 1; ' doesn't work with r or 1; and r and 1 don't work together).  So, to get a set of four symbols, we have to include a couple of three-segment ones.</p>

<p>Any two of upper n and upper u or upper c make an upper o.  Upper u and lower n make H and thence upside-down A and out.  Upper u or upper c combine with 7, making q, from whence we get A and g.  Upper u also combines with J sans hook, making y and thence upside-down again.  Upper c and lower n make h-with-hook, and thence A and b-with-hook.  Upper c combines with L, making E and thence b and P with hooks.  Any two of lower n and lower u or lower c make o.  Lower n with L makes b, or with J makes d, and either thence gets upside-down A.  Lower c with J makes d, same problem.  L and J make U, and again the upside-down A.  J and 7 make ].</p>

<p>Thus:</p>

<pre><code>upper    lower    
n  u
n     c
   u  c
   u              J
      c  n
      c              L
         n  u
         n     c
            u  c
                  J     7
</code></pre>

<p>There aren't any trios in there.  7 and L only show up in one row, remove those and J is only in one row, combining all lowers or all uppers makes o several ways, and there's only one upper-lower combination.</p>

<p>Thus, we'd need to add singles or pairs to these.  Considering just which ones are valid individually, we have (for simplicity, not recording positions):</p>

<pre><code>upper    lower    
n  u                         '     1
n     c                            1
   u  c                            1
   u              J             -
      c  n                         1
      c              L             1
         n  u                '     1
         n     c                      r
            u  c                   1  r
                  J     7
</code></pre>

<p>There's only one of these where there are two smaller symbols that go together -- the second-to-last.  That's an upper r, and a right-side 1.  u + c = o, u + r = G, u + 1 = J with hook, c + r = E, c + 1 = d, r + 1 = 7 with hook, u + c + r = 6, u + c + 1 = d, c + r + 1 = 8 -- and there it fails, since that's not distinct from the set of all of them.</p>

<p>Thus, I think that's an exhaustive proof that your set of seven-segment numbers is a maximal set.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The proof is only true if the initial set is complete.  I left out "".  It doesn't make triplets, doesn't work with all-lower or all-upper three-segment pairs, and doesn't work with J or 1, so it doesn't affect the result.</p>

<p>Also, things get slightly more interesting if <code>-</code> and <code>_</code> are considered distinct, but not a lot; they don't trio with any of the other one- and two-segment symboles, and as a pair they don't combine with any upper or lower three-segment symbols, nor the J or 7.  Likewise <code>'</code> and <code>,</code> -- they again don't trio with the other one- and two-segment symbols, and as a pair don't combine with any of the three-segment pairs.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I also missed upper u or upper c and 7 make 9.  Again, this doesn't go anywhere; even though u and c also go together, the trio makes 9 two ways.  Neither of those go anywhere with smaller symbols either.</p>

","display loading","<iphone><xcode><uiview><transparent><uiactivityindicatorview>","2010-09-13 06:12:25","429","3698250","1","<p>Sure, create a new UIView subclass, call it whatever you like. Add a couple of ivars, one for your activity indicator, and one for your message (so a <code>UIActivityIndicatorView</code> and a <code>UILabel</code>). Connect those up to properties if you wish, probably a good idea for the label anyway.</p>

<p>You'll also want to define some methods, things like <code>-show</code> and <code>-hide</code> to show the view and hide it. You can get fancy animating it however you want, if you want, I'm not going to go into that here.</p>

<p>Next thing you'll want to do (or at least how I've done it) is to create the view, by specing out its frame, let's just define it like this:</p>

<pre><code>UIWindow* keyWindow = [[UIApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow];
CGFloat width = 160;
CGFloat height = 160;
CGRect centeredFrame = CGRectMake(round(keyWindow.bounds.size.width/2 - width/2),
                                  round(keyWindow.bounds.size.height/2 - height/2),
                                  width, height);
</code></pre>

<p>This will make it 160x160. Adjust its <code>backgroundColor</code> to 50% opacity, make sure its <code>opaque</code> property is also set to NO. You'll also want something like:</p>

<pre><code>self.layer.cornerRadius = 10;
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>self</code> points at the view you're creating naturally.</p>

<p>That should be enough information to get you started, most people animate it (I typically make it really big, i.e., 160x2 by 160x2, and rapidly shrink it down to the size I want, to give it a popping effect, fade it out on completion, stuff like that). I'll leave that as an exercise for you though.</p>

<p>For each pair of genes, <code>geneX</code> and <code>geneY</code> I have a score telling how similiar the two genes are (actually, I have two scores, since I used BLAST which is 'directional': I first searched <code>geneX</code> against all the other genes then <code>geneY</code> against all the other genes, so I have two <code>geneX--geneY</code> scores, but I guess I can take the lower score of the two, or the average).</p>

<p>So, let's suppose I have only one score for each pair of genes. My data can be viewed as a undirected graph:

"3701859","<p>I have been using WinForms since the first framework introduced and invested a lot of time and effort in it. Now I am attempting to move to WPF and, honestly, it's not so easy.</p>

<p>Now I have a task, I need to implement a simple wizard, each page of which has a aligned to center group of controls. The group contains a set of buttons, four button in a row. Width of the group is constant, height is variable -- it depends on the number of buttons inside.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/rRt5j.gif"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>It's a simple task for WinForms, but I have no idea how to do it using XAML.</p>

<p>I have three questions:</p>

<p>1). Obviously, the buttons inside a group is a <em>WrapPanel</em> which is placed in a Grid's cell. It's simple. But how to calculate height of the <em>WrapPanel</em> not using code behind?</p>

<p>2). Which is recommended way to implement wizard? Data template or some kind of <em>Tab Control</em>? I probably will need to have some transition effects when switching pages.</p>

<p>3). Is it acceptable in WPF world to use binding as a way to repositioning controls?</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
","Control positioning & binding","<c#><wpf><user-interface>","2010-09-13 15:27:57","325","3702037","1","<p>The WrapPanel will auto-adjust its height based on its contents by default. WPF is a big advancement from WinForms precisely because of the new layout paradigms. No code behind is needed for anything you've mentioned.</p>

<p>As for 2; there are a lot of ways to implement this, depending on how close you adhere to MVVM (if at all); I'd recommend using a styled TabControl at first (you can adjust the style to present visually the steps in the wizard as tabs, without letting the user jump between tabs), as it's easiest. Also, it's possible to bind pretty much everything to the TabControl.</p>

<p>3 is possible, but should be rarely needed. And I mean it.</p>

<p>Now then; a simple example to show you the power of WPF.
You can have in your ViewModel (if you're not familiar with MVVM google it or read any of <a href=""http://joshsmithonwpf.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Josh Smith</a>'s articles or book or... wow there's such a wealth of information on it I don't know which to choose) a collection of objects, let's say Step classes, which you can bind to the ItemsSource of the TabControl. The TabControl will automatically create a tab for each of your Step.
Inside your Step class, you can have a collection of items, let's say... um, <code>Collection&lt;Push&gt;</code> (I'm struggling not to use known classes like Action or Button). If the ItemTemplate of the TabControl contains anything that recognizes that collection, as in a ListBox styled internally to use a WrapPanel for its ItemsContainer, you're done: the template will show the list of Pushes in a WrapPanel and that's that.</p>

<p>Now, I probably shouldn't write a full tutorial here anyway, but that should get you started. Read up on DataTemplates, ItemsControl etc. (again, I'm having difficulties picking resources... <a href=""http://drwpf.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dr. WPF</a> has awesome articles on both, but they might be a bit advanced) and you should be good to go. Just remember that there's a good reason why WPF features a lot more fluid layouts than any previous desktop technology, you should become familiar with that.</p>

"3702862","<p>I've been recruited to work on a form for tracking specimens. Each specimen is associated with a subject; each specimen also has a particular slot in a 9 x 9 storage box. For ease of data entry, I think it would be best if the Access form mirrored the box itself (and the paper forms that will be used to enter data into Access): nine columns by nine rows, with each element consisting basically of a text box for the specimen ID. This is basically how I'd like it to look:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Hr5ak.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>
<p>So the data entry person would essentially type in the box number and specimen IDs, then click &quot;Create Records&quot; to pop all of those records into existence (you can see some other stuff going on here, but that's not really important right now). I'm not really sure about the best way to code this, however. Right now, the best process I can think of is to: 1) run an insert query to create the box if it doesn't exist, 2) run an insert query to create the subject (person), if it doesn't exist, and 3) run an insert query for each specimen, hard-coding in its row and column (e.g. box_col = 'A', box_row = '1').</p>
<p>Note: the subject ID and specimen ID would both be parsed out of the ID field - it's goofy, not my idea, but that's how it's set up. I can handle that, though.</p>
<p>This is a certainly a kludge, but I'm not sure what else to do and most of what I've googled up hasn't been pertinent to multiple-record creation from a single form. Is there a better way to do this? Should I simply abandon the idea and go with a more traditional bound subform approach?</p>

There is nothing wrong with doing it this way.  Once the data is all entered just have a button on the form that does the multiple inserts at once.
Start at 1 and include 9 iterations each time issuing a new <code>INSERT</code> statement.</p>

<p>Once the statement has been completed I would personally put a little check mark next to each row so that if an insert succeded it would check it true, else false.  You could be nifty and use a green image / red image.  After it has completed the process all fields should be cleared allowing additional entry.</p>

If you only have maybe 10 or 20 developers, I'm not sure it will make sense to put such an elaborate workflow into place.  If you're managing 500, sure...</p>

<p>My personal feeling is KISS.  Keep It Simple, Stupid... You want a process that's both efficient, and more important: simple.  If it's complicated, either nobody is going to do it right, or after time parts will slip.  If you make it simple, it will become second nature and after a few weeks nobody would question the process (Well, the semantics of it anyway)...</p>

<p>And the other personal feeling is always run all of your UNIT tests.  That way, you can skip a whole decision tree in your flow chart.  After all, what's more expensive, a few minutes of CPU time, or the brain cycles to understand the difference between the partial test passing and the massive test failing.  Remember, a fail is a fail, and there's no practical reason that code should ever be shown to a reviewer that has the potential to fail the build.</p>

<p>Now, Selenium tests are typically quite expensive, so I might agree to push those off until after the reviewer approves.  But you'll need to think about that one...</p>

<p>Oh, and if I was implementing this, I would put a formal QC stage in there.  I want human testers to look at any changes that are being made.  Yes, Selenium can verify the things you know about, but only a human can find things you didn't think of.  Feed back their findings into new Selenium and Integration tests to prevent regressions...</p>

Then change the class of the controller you added (it's the last tab in the inspector) to your custom UITableViewController class (if you don't subclass it it does nothing)</p>

<p>Then make sure that you somehow retain the controller when the nib is loaded. Easiest way is with an IBOutlet in the file's owner.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Is it correct that the presentation layer is either Excel or a web service and nothing else?  What if you wanted to deploy a web reporting platform such as SSRS, Cognos, Business Objects, Microstrategy, etc.?  These platforms generally access the data directly without web services.</p></li>
<li><p>You may need to output additional data to flat files and downstream databases.  The data may be based off either the OLAP cube or the raw source data.  Therefore, you may want to include these as destinations at the main data warehouse level and the OLAP level.</p></li>
<li><p>If you implement a web presentation layer, it may not only be over an OLAP cube.  It is likely you will receive a request to report on data that isn't contained in an OLAP cube and it may not be worth the effort to add it just to support a few reports.  If this is the case, then you will probably want to note that the main data warehouse could be a source for a web reporting platform -- not just OLAP.</p></li>
<li><p>Data marts don't generally contain aggregated data -- they generally contain detail-level data.  The OLAP cube performs aggregations over the detailed data, but the underlying data mart itself contains transaction-level facts.</p></li>
<li><p>You could have additional data sources that are imported by the ETL process such as web services.  You may also want to stress that there are multiple databases and flat files just as you stressed there can be multiple data marts and OLAP cubes.</p></li>
<li><p>You don't necessarily need separate data marts for the OLAP cubes.  If you are building one central data warehouse, you may be able to create one central OLAP cube and limit access to dimensions and slices of data based on cube security roles.</p></li>
<li><p>You may want to indicate that you need to load a staging database prior to loading the data warehouse.  Perhaps that isn't the case, but generally I recommend having a separate staging database so that you have a place to load before you merge into the data warehouse.  Some ETL processes can go directly into the data warehouse since they can merge on the way in, but there are plenty of instances where it probably makes sense to load the data in a staging database before merging it into the final destination.  This also means ETL / Stored Procedures probably should be its own entity in the diagram since it is a method for moving data more than it is a destination or object.  If you look at your diagram, all your entities are actual objects and not processes like MDX.</p></li>
<li><p>You may want to indicate data is loaded into data marts via an ETL process.  ETL isn't just about loading the data warehouse -- it is about moving data at any stage.  Even processing cubes requires an ETL process.</p></li>
<li><p>Your OLAP server doesn't necessarily have to be on another physical server -- it could be a service on the database server.  It just depends on whether you tackle performance issues by scaling up or scaling out or if you intend to publish cubes to multiple OLAP servers because of geographic performance issues.</p></li>

<p>I'm not quite sure I understand what this question means, but I take it to mean you want to avoid the presence of scroll bars in your app.  To do that, you'll have to develop layout code that sizes and positions your children so that they do not extend past the height and width of your available content space.  In Flex 3 (Halo) architecture, this would be done by writing an updateDisplayList() method for your component.  In the Flex 4 (Spark) architecture, this would probably be done by writing an updateDisplayList() method for your skin class.  </p>

<p>In a resize handler, I would most likely use invalidateSkinState and/or invalidateDisplayList.  The resizing code would be in the skin and/or updateDisplayList.  </p>

"3709152","<p>I'm not too familiar with using the <code>&lt;h:messages&gt;</code> element in JSF. What I'm trying to do is use it to display a list of global messages of varying severity that are generated by a method in my backing bean. Getting the messages into the <code>FacesContext</code> isn't too much of a problem, and my code is along these lines:</p>

<pre><code>FacesMessage message;
FacesContext context = 
    FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();
message = new FacesMessage(
    FacesMessage.SEVERITY_INFO,
    ""test message summary 1"",
    ""test message detail 1"");
context.addMessage(null, message);
message = new FacesMessage(
    FacesMessage.SEVERITY_WARN,
    ""test message summary 2"",
    ""test message detail 2"");
context.addMessage(null, message);
message = new FacesMessage(
    FacesMessage.SEVERITY_ERROR,
    ""test message summary 3"",
    ""test message detail 3"");
context.addMessage(null, message);
// add more messages...
</code></pre>

<p>That all works fine. My problem is with trying to make the output of the <code>&lt;h:messages&gt;</code> tag look good on the page. Here is the relevant piece of my JSP file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h:panelGrid border=""1"" columns=""1"" id=""messagesPanelGrid""&gt;
    &lt;h:messages 
        id=""messagesOutput""
        showSummary=""true""
        showDetail=""true"" 
        layout=""table""
        infoClass=""info-message""
        warnClass=""warn-message""
        errorClass=""error-message""
        fatalClass=""fatal-message"" 
        globalOnly=""true"" /&gt;
&lt;/h:panelGrid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This consistently looks like crap on the page. I am using an external CSS stylesheet to define styling classes. I've tried using <code>layout=""list""</code> but then the list items span the whole page and make any block styling look bad, so I switched to <code>layout=""table""</code>. I framed the <code>&lt;h:messages&gt;</code> inside a <code>&lt;h:panelGrid&gt;</code> so I would have some block-level element that I could apply styles to. It still doesn't look particularly nice.</p>

<p>What I'm getting now:  </p>

<pre><code>&lt;table border=""1"" id=""myForm:messagesOutput""&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=""error-message""&gt;&lt;span&gt;no port name match Could not match reported port name XXXX to a known port for vessel VESSEL A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

<ul>
    <li>Messages are still in a table layout, but the ""summary"" and ""detail"" are in separate columns</li>
    <li>Generated table has a CSS class directly assigned to it</li>
    <li>The ""summary"" and ""detail"" parts of the message have separate style classes</li>
    <li>NICE TO HAVE: Table header row</li>

<p><strong>Does anyone out there work with <code>&lt;h:messages&gt;</code> tags and have some ideas on how I can achieve this?</strong></p>

<p>I'm not sure if it matters for this question, but I'm using MyFaces 1.2. I can't upgrade to 2.x at the moment.</p>
","JSF - How can I format my global messages in <h:messages> in a visually appealing way?","<java><css><web-applications><jsf><myfaces>","2010-09-14 13:09:30","12931","3709889","2","<p>After all, you want to change the HTML output. This really can't be done with CSS. CSS is more to give the existing HTML elements a layout, not to modify them. Apart from fiddling in JavaScript (which isn't easy in this particular case), you'd like to have JSF change its HTML output. There are basically two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Supply your own <code>MessagesRenderer</code> so that it renders messages the way you want. Extend the base renderer class as used in MyFaces (sorry, since I don't use MyFaces I can't tell from top of head which class it is for MyFaces, you need to consult its API docs) and register it in <code>faces-config</code> as follows:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;render-kit&gt;
    &lt;renderer&gt;
        &lt;component-family&gt;javax.faces.Messages&lt;/component-family&gt;
        &lt;renderer-type&gt;javax.faces.Messages&lt;/renderer-type&gt;
        &lt;renderer-class&gt;com.example.CustomMessagesRenderer&lt;/renderer-class&gt;
    &lt;/renderer&gt;
&lt;/render-kit&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>com.example.CustomMessagesRenderer</code> is thus the custom renderer you've implemented. You'd like to override the <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/faces/render/Renderer.html#encodeEnd%28javax.faces.context.FacesContext,%20javax.faces.component.UIComponent%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>encodeEnd()</code></a> method of the standard renderer to have it to output HTML the desired way. This is too much code to post as an example here, but just looking in the source code of the default messages renderer should give enough hints.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect the messages in a <code>List&lt;FacesMessage&gt;</code> with help of <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/faces/context/FacesContext.html#getMessages%28%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>FacesContext#getMessages()</code></a> and just display them with help of <code>c:forEach</code> or <code>t:dataList</code> and plain vanilla HTML. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;FacesMessage&gt; getMessages() {
    List&lt;FacesMessage&gt; messages = new ArrayList&lt;FacesMessage&gt;();
    Iterator&lt;FacesMessage&gt; iter = FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getMessages();
    while (iter.hasNext()) {
        messages.add(iter.next());
    }
    return messages;
}
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;table border=""1"" id=""myForm:messagesOutput"" class=""myMessagesTableClass""&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SUMMARY&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DETAIL&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;c:forEach items=""#{bean.messages}"" var=""message""&gt;
      &lt;c:set var=""type"" value=""#{message.severity == 'SEVERITY_ERROR' ? 'error' : 'warn'}"" /&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td class=""#{type}-message-summary""&gt;&lt;span&gt;#{message.summary}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td class=""#{type}-message-detail""&gt;&lt;span&gt;#{message.detail}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/c:forEach&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In JSF2, you'd have used <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/faces/context/FacesContext.html#getMessageList()"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>#{facesContext.messageList}</code></a> directly instead of <code>#{bean.messages}</code>.</p></li>

","How to create a screen image from TColors and intensities (in Delphi)","<delphi><graphics><colors>","2010-09-14 15:43:28","814","3710954","2","<p>Well, it looks to me like your wavelengths are hues, and your intensity is another word for brightness.  Getting the right colors would be a really simple task if only you had <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a model that represents colors in terms of hue and brightness</a> and a way to convert between it and RGB... :-)</p>

<p>Displaying the colors is actually very simple.  You can use a standard TImage component on a form.  Once you work out what TColor value goes at a certain position, you can set it with</p>

<p><code>image.Canvas.Pixels[x, y] := aColor;</code></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: How to map wavelength to hue:</p>

<p>This is a little tricky since the left hand side of your spectrum seems to be the violet, with the red on the right.  In HSL, red is at the 0 position.  You're going to have to invert your X axis so red is 0 and violet is high.  You can get this by basically saying <code>value := MAX_VALUE - value;</code></p>

<p>Then you need to calibrate the line.  Set the wavelength corresponding to full red equal to 0, and the far blue end equal to whatever its corresponding hue is.  (If you can convert a wavelength to a TColor and then a TColor to HSL that shouldn't be difficult to calculate.)  That's your range, and you need to normalize all wavelengths to fit into that range.</p>

<p>Just eyeballing it, it looks to me like the left end of your example spectrum is at around 270 degrees hue on the color wheel, which equates to 192 on a scale of 0--255.  So take your spectrum from red to blue--again, remember red is LOW, not HIGH--and normalize it to the range 0--192 (or whatever the actual high value is) and you've got your H value.</p>

<p>Also, if you've got some colors on the right end of your color line that go beyond full red towards purple a little, then you'll have a negative hue, which wraps around back to 255.</p>

"3716213","<p>we were asked to develop an iphone app like the one in the figure.
The problem is: we have no experience in IOS development.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/XZttT.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>For the basic part I can handle the learning curve, but i need suggestions, best practices on the UIKit model and controls.</p>

<p>This is a newspaper app.
The accordion control shows/hides content based on categories retrieved by an ASP .NET CMS on which we have no control.</p>

<p>I can suggest to the CMS holder to develop a couple of web services (WCF) but i'm not sure how to interface iOS with MS technology.
Furthermore, i have the idea that simple aspx that returns XML/JSON data will be easier to call, and support, but slightly less secure.</p>

<p>So, suggestions? Tutorials?</p>

<p>Concerning the request and delegate stuff: For a start, I would skip the delegate part and use a synchronized HTTP request called in a thread (you'll see what that is on the second website). That makes the response handling a lot easier for the start. But I personally think, that using an asynchronous request is not a must. It's just nicer, if the architecture allows it.

"3716470","<p>I'm trying to get multiple tabs in windows like vim does it. In vim tabs aren't tied to buffers and you can have multiple tabs each with multiple splits and buffers in them. What I've found so far is:</p>

<ul>
<li>tabbar: shows all tabs.</li>
<li>winring: doesn't show tabs in the window and is clunky to use (have to name each tab first). This is the closest to what I want.</li>

<p>For your subplots, you'll want to use the <code>sharex</code> kwarg when creating them, so that they all share the same x-axis.

(It's a slightly crude hack, but it's the only way to only display x-axis labels on the bottom subplot when sharing the same x-axis between all subplots)   To adjust the spacing between subplots, see <a href=""http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/api/pyplot_api.html#matplotlib.pyplot.subplots_adjust"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>subplots_adjust</code></a>. </p>

<p>More and more new rows will be added dynamically onclick of ""<strong>+</strong>"" button and the row will be removed on click of ""<strong>-</strong>"" button. The question is about binding the values (user input in those dynamically created rows) to the backing model.</p>

<p>I have created a session scoped backing bean. Some portions of the code,</p>

<pre><code>public class BackingBean{
  //other code

  private List&lt;Criteria&gt; searchFilters; // Each criteria is bound to a row

<p>Action of <strong>+</strong> button triggers addEmtpyCriteria method and rerenders(using a4j) the entire section(with new rows). </p>

<p>This is just a boilerplate and everything works fine as long as the bean is session scoped. But its more intuitive to have it in request scope. A single search is a single request made by the user and in no way is tied to the user session. Also having it in session,forces the developer to clear/remove the backingbean from session inorder to display a fresh search screen.</p>

<p>Is there a better way of doing this? Is it right to have it in session scope ?</p>

"3723011","<p>Greetings all,</p>

<p>As seen in the picture</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/4Iew8.png"" alt=""http://i51.tinypic.com/2r56s1j.jpg""></p>

<p>I have an extended QWidget object (which draws the cell images and some countour data) inside a QScrollBar.
User can zoom in/out the Image (QWidget size is changed according to the zoomed size of the QImage ) using mouse wheel.</p>

<p>I process the events (mouseMoveEvent(),wheelEvent()..etc) by implementing the listener methods in QWidget.
My problem is ,I can only perform zooming (and other events) when the mouse pointer is over the QWidget.
If the mouse point is over the QScrollBar (the gray area in the image) ,those events are consumed by the QScroolBar.</p>

<p>Any tips,</p>

<p><strong>[Edit]</strong> Sorry I was refering to QScrollArea , not QScrollBar.</p>

<p>thanks,
umanga</p>
","QT mouse event handling problem","<c++><qt><event-handling><qt4>","2010-09-16 01:06:13","4064","3724311","3","<p>I'm uncertain if you want the scroll wheel to <strong>only</strong> ever be used for zooming the image or if you want the scroll wheel to control zooming when the image is smaller than the scroll area viewport and then use the scroll wheel to do scrolling when the image is larger than the scroll area viewport. In either case, you should be able to customize how the wheel is handled with the following:</p>

<p>Since I've not actually tried this one, I'm not sure if it will work. The hope is that if you install an event filter and set ignore on the event, the event will still be propagated back to your image widget. This will allow you to leave your current mouse handling in the image widget intact.</p>

<pre><code>bool YourImageWidget::eventFilter(QObject *obj, QEvent *event)
{
    if((obj == scrollAreaPointer) &amp;&amp; (event-&gt;type() == QEvent::Wheel))
    {
        if(!scrollAreaShouldHandleWheel)
        {
            event-&gt;ignore();
        }
    }
    return false; // always pass the event back to the scroll area
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>scrollAreaShouldHandleWheel</code> flag is a boolean you would set from your image widget  based on whether or not you want the scroll area to handle the wheel events.</p>

<p>Somewhere in your code you would install your image widget as an event filter for the scrollarea.</p>

<pre><code>scrollArea-&gt;installEventFilter(imageWidget);
</code></pre>

<p>If this doesn't work, you can always use this filter to make sure your widget gets the event and handle it directly and then return true so that the scroll area won't be able to receive the event.</p>

"3723616","<p>For some reason, the expand button the arrow points to in the screenshot below causes the view controller that initiated video playback to animate back over top of the video, but without stopping video playback which means you can still hear the audio even though the video is no longer visible. I've tried other movie control styles, but there are other problems with those (for example, no controls causes the player to play the entire video before dismissing, i.e. no 'Done' button).</p>

<p>Here is the code that initiates the video playback:</p>

<pre><code>player = [[MPMoviePlayerViewController alloc] initWithContentURL:movieURL];
[player setModalTransitionStyle:UIModalTransitionStyleCrossDissolve];
[[self navigationController] presentModalViewController:player animated:YES];
[[player moviePlayer] play];

"3724090","<p>I am essentially storing a private key (Hash) in any of the OctetString attributes within Active Directory.</p>

<p>My question is, what attribute is secure by default and makes sense to keep private data there?  This value should be considered similar to a password, where even administrators shouldn't have access (if possible), just like the current AD Password.</p>

<p>Here is a start of a list of attributes that are enabled by default on a Windows 2008R2 + Exchange 2010 domain.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/g3cgk.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Does anyone know of an Octet String attribute that does not expose ""read"" permissions to all users in the domain by default?  I don't want to store my hash publicly and allow someone to build a rainbow table based on the hashes.</p>
","Storing private ""octet string"" in Active Directory; what is secure by default?","<security><active-directory><ldap><windows-server-2008><acl>","2010-09-16 05:59:41","1818","3783830","3","<p>Here is the answer for the fella who upvoted my question... it's pretty interesting:</p>

<p>The default permissions in Active Directory are such that Authenticated Users have blanket read access to all attributes. This makes it difficult to introduce a new attribute that should be protected from being read by everyone.</p>

<p>To mitigate this, Windows 2003 SP1 introduces a way to mark an attribute as CONFIDENTIAL. This feature achieved by modifying the searchFlags value on the attribute in the schema. SearchFlags contains multiple bits representing various properties of an attribute. E.g. bit 1 means that the attribute is indexed. The new bit 128 (7th bit) designates the attribute as confidential.</p>

<p>Note: you cannot set this flag on base-schema attributes (those derived from ""top"" such as common-name). You can determine if an object is a base schema object by using LDP to view the object and checking the systemFlags attribute of the object. If is the 10th bit is set it is a base schema object.</p>

<p>When the Directory Service performs a read access check, it checks for confidential attributes. If there are, then in addition to READ_PROPERTY access, the Directory Service will also require CONTROL_ACCESS access on the attribute or its property set.</p>

<p>By default, only Administrators have CONTROL_ACCESS access to all objects. Thus, only Administrators will be able to read confidential attributes. Users are free to delegate this right to any specific group they want. This can be done with DSACLs tool, scripting, or the R2 ADAM version of LDP. As of this writing is not possible to use ACL UI Editor to assign these permissions.</p>

<p>The process of marking an attribute Confidential and adding the users that need to view the attribute has 3 Steps</p>

<p>1.Determining what attribute to mark Confidential, or adding an attribute to mark Confidential.</p>

<p>2.Marking it confidential</p>

<p>3.Granting the correct users the Control_Access right so they can view the attribute.</p>

"3726088","<p>I starting to investigate whether Ruby-on-Rails will help solve my problem in some way?</p>

<p>In short, I have a legacy application which is reading and writing a collection of images. This application also uses a sqlite database to help refer to correct image files when required.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is have an iPhone and/or iPad application browse the images, but also be able to see updates and additional images <em>without</em> hitting a refresh button; or using a periodic timer say.</p>

<p>This brought me to investigate Ruby-on-Rails as a solution?</p>

<p>I made the following diagram to think about whether I'm on the right path:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Dtg1u.jpg"" alt=""isrubyonrailstheanswer"">
To date I obviously have the (legacy) in-place linux app, which generates images and updates the database.  I have also embedded a bonjour service inside the linux app to allow an iPhone application to connect and to-date browse thumbnails that are inside the sqlite database.  The tricky part is that I've realised that the iPhone app needed to be kicked to update its images when the database is changed remotely.</p>

<p>Actually I thought that with a ruby-on-rails app it could provide a RESTful service to access fullsize (plus, thumbnail) images allowing the thumbnail images to be removed from the sqlite database - it's likely the database could have 10000+ entries, so didn't want the db to grow unnecessarily. </p>

<p>Any tips or resources would be great.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I had a think about the wording of my question again. I guess I was trying to figure out if I could get something like <em>Rails</em> to monitor changes to a database without polling in some way.</p>
","Is Ruby on Rails solution to async notify iPhone app of updates?","<iphone><ruby-on-rails><linux>","2010-09-16 11:14:21","343","3726506","2","<p>The simplest solutions I can think of is to have an action on your RESTful service which pulls the most recently modified date from the database.  Periodically query this from your iPhone app, and then refresh the list.</p>

<p>For example, if you create scaffolding for images:</p>

<pre><code>rails generate scaffold Image name:string filename:string # fill in the other attributes you need
</code></pre>

<p>NOTE: You will have to sync your legacy DB to this Rails table</p>

<p>Then each image object is automatically created with an ""updated_at"" attribute.</p>

<pre><code>class ImagesController &lt; ApplicationController
  # GET /images
  # GET /images.xml
  def index
    @images = Image.all

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html # index.html.erb
      format.xml  { render :xml =&gt; @images }
    end
  end

  # GET /images/1
  # GET /images/1.xml
  def show
    @image = Image.find(params[:id])

    respond_to do |format|
      format.html # show.html.erb
      format.xml  { render :xml =&gt; @image }
    end
  end

  def newest
    @image = Image.find(:last, :order =&gt; :updated_at)

      format.html # show.html.erb
      format.xml  { render :xml =&gt; @image }
    end
  end

  # more methods down here
end
</code></pre>

<p>and you'll have to add the following match line to your routes.rb</p>

<pre><code>YourAppName::Application.routes.draw do
  match 'images/newest' =&gt; 'images#newest'
  resources :images
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, from the iPhone app you can pull an XML file describing your most recent image with this URL</p>

<pre><code>http://localhost:3000/images/newest.xml
</code></pre>

<p>Parse out the most recently updated time, and compare it to your last refresh date.</p>

"3727130","<p>I've been using databinding in several simple situations with pretty good success.  Usually I just use INotifyPropertyChanged to enable my codebehind to modify the GUI values on screen, rather than implement dependency properties for everything.</p>

<p>I am playing with an LED control to learn more about databinding in user controls, and was forced to use dependency properties because VS2008 told me I had to.  My application is straightforward -- I have a window that displays several LED controls, each with a number above it and optionally, one to its side.  The LEDs should be definable with a default color, as well as change state.</p>

<p>I started by writing an LED control, which seemed to go perfectly fine.  First, I started with code like this:</p>

<p><strong>LED.xaml</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl x:Class=""LEDControl.LED""
xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""
Height=""Auto"" Width=""Auto""&gt;

    &lt;Grid&gt;
        &lt;Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
            &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=""Auto""/&gt;
            &lt;ColumnDefinition Width=""Auto""/&gt;
        &lt;/Grid.ColumnDefinitions&gt;
        &lt;!-- LED portion --&gt;
        &lt;Ellipse Grid.Column=""0"" Margin=""3"" Height=""{Binding LEDSize}"" Width=""{Binding LEDSize}"" Fill=""{Binding LEDColor}"" StrokeThickness=""2"" Stroke=""DarkGray"" /&gt;
        &lt;Ellipse Grid.Column=""0"" Margin=""3"" Height=""{Binding LEDSize}"" Width=""{Binding LEDSize}""&gt;
            &lt;Ellipse.Fill&gt;
                &lt;RadialGradientBrush GradientOrigin=""0.5,1.0""&gt;
                    &lt;RadialGradientBrush.RelativeTransform&gt;
                        &lt;TransformGroup&gt;
                            &lt;ScaleTransform CenterX=""0.5"" CenterY=""0.5"" ScaleX=""1.5"" ScaleY=""1.5""/&gt;
                            &lt;TranslateTransform X=""0.02"" Y=""0.3""/&gt;
                        &lt;/TransformGroup&gt;
                    &lt;/RadialGradientBrush.RelativeTransform&gt;
                    &lt;GradientStop Offset=""1"" Color=""#00000000""/&gt;
                    &lt;GradientStop Offset=""0.4"" Color=""#FFFFFFFF""/&gt;
                &lt;/RadialGradientBrush&gt;
            &lt;/Ellipse.Fill&gt;
        &lt;/Ellipse&gt;
        &lt;!-- label --&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock Grid.Column=""1"" Margin=""3"" VerticalAlignment=""Center"" Text=""{Binding LEDLabel}"" /&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/UserControl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This draws an LED just fine.  I then bound LEDSize, LEDLabel, and LEDColor to the Ellipse properties by setting <code>this.DataContext = this</code> like I always do:</p>

<p><strong>LED.xaml.cs</strong></p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Interaction logic for LED.xaml
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public partial class LED : UserControl, INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private Brush state_color_;
    public Brush LEDColor
    {
        get { return state_color_; }
        set { 
            state_color_ = value;
            OnPropertyChanged( ""LEDColor"");
        }
    }

    private int led_size_;
    public int LEDSize
    {
        get { return led_size_; }
        set {
            led_size_ = value;
            OnPropertyChanged( ""LEDSize"");
        }
    }

    private string led_label_;
    public string LEDLabel
    {
        get { return led_label_; }
        set {
            led_label_ = value;
            OnPropertyChanged( ""LEDLabel"");
        }
    }

    public LED()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        this.DataContext = this;
    }

    #region INotifyPropertyChanged Members

    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    protected void OnPropertyChanged( string property_name)
    {
        if( PropertyChanged != null)
            PropertyChanged( this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs( property_name));
    }

    #endregion
}
</code></pre>

<p>At this point, I can change the property values and see that the LED changes size, color and its label.  Great!</p>

<p>I want the LED control to be reusable in other widgets that I write over time, and the next step for me was to create another UserControl (in a separate assembly), called <code>IOView</code>.  <code>IOView</code> is pretty basic at this point:</p>

<p><strong>IOView.xaml</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl x:Class=""IOWidget.IOView""
    xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
    xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""
    xmlns:led=""clr-namespace:LEDControl;assembly=LEDControl""
    Height=""Auto"" Width=""Auto""&gt;
    &lt;Grid&gt;
        &lt;Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
            &lt;RowDefinition /&gt;
            &lt;RowDefinition /&gt;
        &lt;/Grid.RowDefinitions&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock Grid.Row=""0"" HorizontalAlignment=""Center"" Text=""{Binding Path=Index}"" /&gt;
        &lt;led:LED Grid.Row=""1"" HorizontalContentAlignment=""Center"" HorizontalAlignment=""Center"" LEDSize=""30"" LEDColor=""Green"" LEDLabel=""Test"" /&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/UserControl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that I can modify the LED properties in XAML at design time and everything works as expected:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/y2hOl.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I then blindly tried to databind LEDColor to my IOView, and VS2008 kindly told me <strong><em>""A 'Binding' cannot be set on the 'LEDColor' property of type 'LED'. A 'Binding' can only be set on a DependencyProperty of a DependencyObject.""</em></strong>  Oops!  I hadn't even realized that since I haven't made my own GUI controls before.  Since the <code>LEDColor</code> is already databound to the Ellipse, I added a DependencyProperty called Color.</p>

<p><strong>LED.xaml.cs</strong></p>

<pre><code>    public static DependencyProperty ColorProperty = DependencyProperty.Register( ""Color"", typeof(Brush), typeof(LED));
    public Brush Color
    {
        get { return (Brush)GetValue(ColorProperty); }
        set { 
            SetValue( ColorProperty, value);
            LEDColor = value;
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I set the property <code>LEDColor</code> in the setter, since that's how the Ellipse knows what color it should be.</p>

<p>The next baby step involved setting the color of the LED in my IOView by binding to IOView.InputColor:</p>

<p><strong>IOView.xaml.cs:</strong></p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Interaction logic for IOView.xaml
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
public partial class IOView : UserControl, INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private Int32 index_;
    public Int32 Index
    {
        get { return index_; }
        set {
            index_ = value;
            OnPropertyChanged( ""Index"");
        }
    }

    private Brush color_;
    public Brush InputColor
    {
        get { return color_; }
        set {
            color_ = value;
            OnPropertyChanged( ""InputColor"");
        }
    }

    private Boolean state_;
    public Boolean State
    {
        get { return state_; }
        set {
            state_ = value;
            OnPropertyChanged( ""State"");
        }
    }

    public IOView()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        this.DataContext = this;
    }

    #region INotifyPropertyChanged Members

    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    protected void OnPropertyChanged( string property_name)
    {
        if( PropertyChanged != null)
            PropertyChanged( this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs( property_name));
    }

    #endregion
}
</code></pre>

<p>and in IOView.xaml, I changed the LED to this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;led:LED Grid.Row=""1"" HorizontalContentAlignment=""Center"" HorizontalAlignment=""Center"" LEDSize=""30"" Color=""{Binding InputColor}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But it's not working, because of the following error in the Output window:</p>

<p><em>BindingExpression path error: 'InputColor' property not found on 'object' ''LED' (Name='')'. BindingExpression:Path=InputColor; DataItem='LED' (Name=''); target element is 'LED' (Name=''); target property is 'Color' (type 'Brush')</em></p>

<p>Hmm... so for some reason, my DataBinding is messed up.  I can get the LED to work on its own with databinding, but once I wrap it in another control and set its datacontext, it doesn't work.  I'm not sure what to try at this point.</p>

<p>I'd love to get as detailed an answer as possible.  I know that I could have just retemplated a CheckBox to get the same results, but this is an experiment for me and I'm trying to understand how to databind to controls' descendants.</p>
","Misunderstanding databinding fundamentals and DataContexts -- long story","<c#><wpf><data-binding><datacontext>","2010-09-16 13:28:35","766","3727778","1","<p>There's a lot to say about all this, but let me see if I can provide pointers that addresses some of your misunderstandings:</p>

<ul>
<li>In order for a property to be the <em>target</em> of a binding, that property must be a dependency property. WPF (and Silverlight) use dependency properties as a means for tracking changes, supporting value precedence (for animations and the like), and a bunch of other useful things. Note that I said ""target"". The <em>source</em> of a binding can be any old object that supports change notification.</li>
<li>Setting a <code>UserControl</code>'s <code>DataContext</code> within the <code>UserControl</code> itself is considered bad practice because any consumer of your control can change it, and doing so will break any bindings within your control that depend on that context</li>
<li>In addition to the above point, the other issue is that you will break any bindings in <em>consuming</em> code that depend on the data context ""above"" the user control. This explains the issue you're seeing with <code>InputColor</code> not successfully binding. The <code>InputColor</code> property is in the data context provided by the host control (<code>IOView</code>) but the data context of the LED is set to the LED itself, so the property can't be found without qualifying the binding further.</li>
</ul>

"3727179","<p>I have two tables, <code>tabSparePart</code> and <code>tabSparePartCategory</code>. Every spare part belongs to a spare part category.

"3729648","<p>I have a function that loads a sprite sheet, finds a block of sprites, and then puts each individual sprite into a list.  Before it appends a sprite into the list, it will blit it onto the screen.  Once it's done loading sprites, it will then iterate through the list, blitting each sprite as it goes.  The two sets of blits <em>should</em> be identical, but instead the first sprite is dropped from the list, and the last sprite is duplicated.  The two sets of blits look like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/8WdA3.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Each sprite is blitted in the order it was appended to the list, going from left to right, top to bottom, so the first sprite is the top left one, and the last is the bottom right.</p>

<p>Here's the function that loads the sprites:</p>

            image = image.convert()

<p>The following code works (when the inputs are wrapped in form tags) in basic html document. However, when placed inside either a DNN skin or DNN module, it fails to work and generates a javascript here. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;script language=""javascript"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    (function ($) {
        $(document).ready(function () {
            jQuery(""#xsearch"").watermark(""Leave blank for USA"");

<p>The Error (FireBug): </p>

<pre><code>jQuery(""#xsearch"").watermark is not a function
[Break on this error] jQuery(""#xsearch"").watermark(""Leave blank for USA""); 
</code></pre>

<p>This alternate code produces the same error:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script language=""javascript"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    jQuery.noConflict();
    jQuery(function () {
        jQuery(""#xsearch"").watermark(""Leave blank for USA"");
        jQuery(""#xsubmit"").click(
            function () {

            }
        );
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, the same error is produced when I replace jQuery with $</p>

<p>It feels like a conflict of some sort, but I'm lost on what to do next.</p>

<p>At the top is a menu which let you select the different Pages. I have for the main area about 8 pages for e.g. a settings page and 4 content pages. The Sidebar displays some additional informations which can be choosen by the user and the bottom shows only a page when 1 of the content pages are opened.
So my content pages have ViewModels behind to fill them and im trying to use commands in the near future when im understand all features of them ;). So im trying to use the MVVM way, but im very new at this.</p>

<p>I don't really need a navigation menu like it is given from navigation windows.</p>

<p>So is it the best way for an application like that to use Frames or are there any better solutions? </p>
","WPF How to design a multi-window Application?","<c#><wpf><mvvm>","2010-09-17 07:39:46","3302","3740998","1","<p>Frames support the built-in navigation infrastructure of WPF so they're a good choice if you plan to use that. It does have some problems (at least some people think so, including me) but for simple/small applications it will do just fine. Of course they'll also work if you want to roll your own light-weight navigation system, like I usually do. I generally navigate by sending instances of ViewModels around and setting them as the contents of windows or content controls, and letting DataTemplates 'dress' them up as they are defined in the views. For larger projects I'd always recommend one of the awesome frameworks which include navigation systems like Prism or Magellan.</p>

<p>Basically it all depends on your requirements; there are a lot of ways to get it right. It's good that you're trying to use MVVM, try to stick with that and it will generally automatically guide you in a good direction.</p>

<p>I'd suggest using a docking library like AvalonDock to spice your application up a bit... however I have a bitter experience with it as it's <strong>not</strong> MVVM-friendly. I recently spent the better part of a week wrestling with it to make it usable enough in a MVVM scenario and I'm not sure it can ever be done. There may be other libraries that handle things better, but (full-featured, like in Visual Studio) docking is a complicated matter so maybe don't go there. Sorry, I probably felt the need to vent after the AvalonDock frustrations.</p>

"3736208","<p>Okay. I'm sick of this problem.  This <em>has to</em> have an easy fix, I'm sure of it!! I hope SO can help me to get rid of this once and for all!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Question</strong></p>
  
  <p>How do we get Eclipse to stop trying
  to process/compile all files under a
  particular project directory?  The
  goal is for no errors/warnings to
  exist in the problems view if they
  relate to something in this folder or it's subfolders.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>We run Eclipse 3.6 and the m2eclipse plugin v0.10.2.20100623 manages our autobuild. For reasons beyond my control, we have the entire BlazeDS distribution in our SVN project directory under <code>src/main/resources/blazeds</code>.  Essentially, this directory contains a vanilla distribution of tomcat running blazeds to which all our configuration and project files are added when we deploy to our server via SCP.</p>

<p>So, when we run deploy, this version of tomcat is copied to the server and our project is placed inside.  Tomcat and our RIA application work and everything is fine.</p>

<p>The problem is, Eclipse tries to compile everything under <code>src/main/resources/blazeds</code> when running AutoBuild and this generates about 300 errors/warnings in our problem view.  So when a real error surfaces, it gets lost among the noise.</p>

<p>The errors stem from code in <code>/blazeds/tomcat/webapps/samples/testdrive-datapush</code> and also the <code>testdrive-httpservice</code>, <code>traderdesktop</code> example webapps. They have dependent source code that's not on the classpath and jars that aren't included in the libraries.</p>

<p><strong>Failed Attempted Solutions</strong></p>

<p>I'm trying to push the proper solution: to remove the samples completely and also to get blazeds out of our version control.  That's not happening anytime soon.</p>

<p>I've followed the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2514296/how-do-i-remove-error-warnings-made-by-tpl-files-in-my-eclipse-project"">SO answer here</a> but it's only a very temporary solution.  I've tried adding exclusions everywhere I can think of and other members of my team have done the same.  I've removed <code>src/main/resources</code> as a source directory (in preferences > Java Build Path > Source Tab) I've added exclusions for <code>blazeds</code> under the resource directory.  I've tried every permutation of <code>blazeds</code> and <code>**</code> as in <code>*blazeds*</code>, <code>**/blazeds/**</code>, etc.</p>

<p>I've even tried including the libraries and source files the compiler is complaining about but I couldn't get it right without excessively mangling our project configuration.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  
  <p>This has to be simple. What is the
  conventional way to exclude a folder
  that is producing warnings/errors in
  an eclipse project?</p>
  
  <p><hr>
  <strong><em>Update #1:</em></strong> <br>
  gedim's solution below is decent but it<br>
  1) doesn't clear red X's from the project<br>
  2) is a change everyone on our team needs to do, manually<br>(i.e., it's not in a project property file; thereby, it isn't checked into subversion)<br>
  <br>
  I hope there's a way to address the core problem by telling Eclipse that this directory doesn't contain<br>
  items to compile/validate. Such a change would likely show up in one of the project setting files.</p>

<p>You keep working with the values you're used to, just like if you were still developing for 3G / 3Gs. The unit of these values is now called points instead of pixels, to avoid confusion. On the older iPhone models, a 2x2 point square equals 2x2 pixels on the screen. But on iPhone 4 the same square equals 4x4 pixels.

<p>Well I decided the best thing would be to stick them in a database, so at least I don't have <a href=""http://cid-0e685da213fd5935.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?page=browse&amp;resid=E685DA213FD5935!148&amp;type=6&amp;authkey=WOUgehAzQ!o%24&amp;Bsrc=EMSHGM&amp;Bpub=SN.Notifications"" rel=""noreferrer"">to parse the raw files</a> every time. But since I know nothing about databases this is turning out to be quite confusing.  I tried some tutorials to create a sqlite database, add a table and field and try to insert my numpy.arrays, but it can't get it to work. </p>

<p>Typically my results per dog look like this: 
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/2403W.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>So I have 35 different dogs and each dog has 24 measurement. Each measurement itself has an unknown amount of contacts. Each measurement consists out of a 3D array (248 frames of the whole plate [255x63]) and a 2D array (the maximal values for each sensor of the plate [255x63]). Storing one value in a database wasn't a problem, but getting my 2D arrays in there didn't seem to work.</p>

<p>So my question is how should I order this in a database and insert my arrays into it?</p>
","How to insert arrays into a database?","<python><database-design><numpy>","2010-09-17 19:16:31","12199","3738402","6","<p>You'll probably want to start out with a <code>dogs</code> table containing all the flat (non array) data for each dog, things which each dog has <em>one</em> of, like a name, a sex, and an age:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `dogs` (
  `id` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `name` VARCHAR(64),
  `age` INT UNSIGNED,
  `sex` ENUM('Male','Female')
);
</code></pre>

<p>From there, each dog ""has many"" measurements, so you need a <code>dog_mesaurements</code> table to store the 24 measurements:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `dog_measurements` (
  `id` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `dog_id` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  `paw` ENUM ('Front Left','Front Right','Rear Left','Rear Right'),
  `taken_at` DATETIME NOT NULL
);
</code></pre>

<p>Then whenever you take a measurement, you <code>INSERT INTO dog_measurements (dog_id,taken_at) VALUES (*?*, NOW());</code> where * <em>?</em> * is the dog's ID from the <code>dogs</code> table.</p>

<p>You'll then want tables to store the actual frames for each measurement, something like:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE `dog_measurement_data` (
  `id` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
  `dog_measurement_id` INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  `frame` INT UNSIGNED,
  `sensor_row` INT UNSIGNED,
  `sensor_col` INT UNSIGNED,
  `value` NUMBER
);
</code></pre>

<p>That way, for each of the 250 frames, you loop through each of the 63 sensors, and store the value for that sensor with the frame number into the database:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO `dog_measurement_data` (`dog_measurement_id`,`frame`,`sensor_row`,`sensor_col`,`value`) VALUES
(*measurement_id?*, *frame_number?*, *sensor_row?*, *sensor_col?*, *value?*)
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously replace <em>measurement_id?</em>, <em>frame_number?</em>, <em>sensor_number?</em>, <em>value?</em> with real values :-)</p>

<p>So basically, each <code>dog_measurement_data</code> is a <em>single sensor value for a given frame</em>. That way, to get all the sensor values for all a given frame, you would:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT `sensor_row`,sensor_col`,`value` FROM `dog_measurement_data`
WHERE `dog_measurement_id`=*some measurement id* AND `frame`=*some frame number*
ORDER BY `sensor_row`,`sensor_col`
</code></pre>

<p>And this will give you all the rows and cols for that frame.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>
I should add that the ""4"" only applies to Guids that have been generated according to the Guid.NewGuid algorithm as implemented in .NET. There is nothing to stop you from taking any arbitrary byte[16] and converting it to Guid. So, you can only bank on it being 4 for the current implementation of the algorithm in .Net. If you are getting Guids from another source, you can't bank on the 4. An update to .Net or possibly windows(depending if .Net uses its own or Windows' generator) may change the fixed numbers of the GUID</p>

<p>e.g. the following is completely working code and will not have the 4 in position:</p>

<pre><code>        var rand = new Random();
        var byteArray = new byte[16];
        rand.NextBytes(byteArray);

First, you will need robust code to compute the intersection between two segments.
This is discussed (with code) <a href=""http://cs.smith.edu/~orourke/books/compgeom.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. Once you have the intersection points, you need
to compute how the polygon boundary interacts with your segment in the neighborhoods of those
intersection points.  This is essentially
repeated <code>LeftOf( )</code> computations, using the notation in my book.
In your image, the segment passes through vertex <em>b</em>, while the adjacent vertices <em>a</em> and <em>c</em>
(in a consecutive sequence (<em>a,b,c</em>)) are both to the same side of <em>b</em>. Therefore, the segment
does not penetrate to the interior of the polygon in the neighborhood of <em>b</em>.  But if <em>a</em> and <em>c</em>
were on opposite sides of the segment, then it must penetrate.</p>

","Java, how to draw constantly changing graphics","<java><graphics>","2010-09-18 17:35:55","23613","3743883","4","<p>Here's my major rewrite with the following noteworthy changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I've separated the task of detecting pixel colours from the task of drawing</li>
<li>I've replaced robot.getPixelColor(...) with robot.createScreenCapture(...) to fetch all 64 pixels at once, rather than one at a time</li>
<li>I've introduced smart clipping - only what needs to be redrawn is redrawn. </li>
<li>I've fixed up threading so all updates to the model and view happen on the Event Dispatch Thread</li>
</ul>

<p>The ticker runs constantly. When it detects a change in pixel colour (either due to the mouse moving to a different region or the pixels under the mouse changing) it detects exactly what changed, updates the model, then requests the view to repaint. This approach updates instantly to the human eye. 289 screen updates took cumulatively 1 second.</p>

<p>It was an enjoyable challenge for a quiet Saturday evening.</p>

As long as FKBudgetID is a part of the composite primary key you won't be able to modify it.

"3742849","<p>I'm trying to improve user compatibility of a site for 800 x 600px monitors.</p>

<p>I have a 'headerbackground' div which is 900px wide, and contains nothing but a background image. The rest of the site is nested inside that div, with a width of 790px.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is show the full 900px 'headerbackground' div if the browser window is greater than 900px, but <em>not</em> trigger a horizontal scrollbar in the browser if the screen res is between 790 &amp; 900px.</p>

<p>I'm aware that this can be easily achieved with a centered 'background' image on the body tag, but that isn't a feasible option in this case because the current body background image has a horizontally-repeating background, and the header background image doesn't repeat.</p>

<p>Any suggestions appreciated</p>

<p>Give headerbackground div a width of 100%, and a min-width the same as the internal divs. Center the headerbackground div's background image. Finally, you'll need a min-width hack to make IE 6 happy.</p>

<p>So it seems like the new VS highlights whole sections of code when the mouse is over the collapsible line on the far left of the IDE. I don't know what this feature is called but I couldn't see any option in the Options to turn this off.</p>
