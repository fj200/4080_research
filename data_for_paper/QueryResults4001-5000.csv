"3743897","<p>Have not done this before (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3742731/java-how-to-draw-constantly-changing-graphics"">except in java</a>, look how <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/2959/steve-mcleod"">Steve McLeod</a> fixed it), so obviously I suck at it. Here 64 pixels around current mouse position get drawn little bigger on a form. Problem is, that it's 'kind of' to slow, and I have no idea where to start fixing.</p>

<p>Besides that, I made a timer thread, that constantly calls update graphics when it's finished and a little fps like text, to show really how fast things are drawn.</p>

<p>Image example: (Image is from letter 'a' in ""IntelliTrace"" in Microsoft VS2010)</p>

<pre><code>for each pixel
  GetDC
  Read Pixel
  ReleaseDC
</code></pre>

<p>You have:</p>

<pre><code>GetDC
for each pixel
  read pixel and store value

<p>Then process the stored pixels.</p>

<p>That said, you're probably better off not using <code>GetPixel</code> at all, as I seem to remember it being terribly inefficient.  I suspect you'd have better performance just grabbing the entire screen into a bitmap and getting the pixels from there.

<p>According to <em>JavaScript: the Good Parts</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>JavaScript was built at a time when Unicode was a 16-bit character set, so all characters in JavaScript are 16 bits wide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This leads me to believe that JavaScript uses UCS-2 (not UTF-16!) and can only handle characters up to U+FFFF.</p>

<p>Further investigation confirms this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; String.fromCharCode(0x20001);
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>fromCharCode</code> method seems to only use the lowest 16 bits when returning the Unicode character. Trying to get U+20001 (CJK unified ideograph 20001) instead returns U+0001.</p>

<p>Question: is it at all possible to handle post-BMP characters in JavaScript?</p>

<hr>

<p>2011-07-31: slide twelve from <strong>Unicode Support Shootout: <em>The Good, The Bad, &amp; the (mostly) Ugly</em></strong> covers issues related to this quite well:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/E7HJk.png""></p>
","JavaScript strings outside of the BMP","<javascript><unicode><utf-16><surrogate-pairs><astral-plane>","2010-09-19 06:17:36","14341","3759300","5","<p>Depends what you mean by ‘support’. You can certainly put non-UCS-2 characters in a JS string using surrogates, and browsers will display them if they can.</p>

<p>But, each item in a JS string is a separate UTF-16 code unit. There is no language-level support for handling full characters: all the standard String members (<code>length</code>, <code>split</code>, <code>slice</code> etc) all deal with code units not characters, so will quite happily split surrogate pairs or hold invalid surrogate sequences.</p>

<p>If you want surrogate-aware methods, I'm afraid you're going to have to start writing them yourself! For example:</p>

<pre><code>String.prototype.getCodePointLength= function() {
    return this.length-this.split(/[\uD800-\uDBFF][\uDC00-\uDFFF]/g).length+1;
};

String.fromCodePoint= function() {
    var chars= Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments);
    for (var i= chars.length; i--&gt;0;) {
        var n = chars[i]-0x10000;
        if (n&gt;=0)
            chars.splice(i, 1, 0xD800+(n&gt;&gt;10), 0xDC00+(n&amp;0x3FF));
    }

i am having just persistence.xml. But totally 3(dwr.xml &amp; web.xml)</p>

<p>I would try to remove the <code>orm.xml</code> indeed, <code>entity-mappings</code> is the root element of the <code>orm.xml</code>, that's what the error is about.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do you mean in ""if you are using a JPA 2.0 provider""? Provider means, Hibernate?? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>JPA is just an API. To use JPA, you need an implementation of this API and such implementations are called persistence providers (EcliseLink, Hibernate, OpenJPA). In your case, you are using Hibernate EntityManager 3.4.0.GA which is a JPA 1.0 implementation.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I have to do to change to JPA 2.0? by adding javax.persistence_2.0.0.jar or by change the hibernate which is using JPA 2.0?? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both, you'd have to use Hibernate EntityManager 3.5+ (and its dependencies, and this includes the javax.persistence_2.0.0.jar).</p>

"3745017","<p>How can I develop an alert system like Facebook's, where User A add User B, User B will get some number in Friend Request Section on the header like in the image below. How can I develop something like that? 
How can we get numbers like this??how can i get codes in PHP and JQuery?

","How to develop alert system like facebook using PHP and Jquery?","<php><jquery><css><notifications>","2010-09-19 08:25:32","14105","3745037","1","<p>I presume you want a means of alerting user A, when user B 'friends' him/her without requiring a page refresh?</p>

<p>This requires ""AJAX"".  AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML, but this is an overloaded term now-a-days with the actual exchange data structure often using JSON instead of XML.  JSON is JavaScript Object Notation.  Anyway, the idea is that your webpage--without being refreshed--can make periodic calls to your server to get new or updated information to update the display with.  With PHP and jQuery, you'll want to first set up the AJAX call on your page like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function() { // on document ready

function updateAlerts() {
   $.ajax({
      url : ""/check.php"",
      type : ""POST"",
      data : {
         method : 'checkAlerts'
      },
      success : function(data, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest) {
         var response = $.parseJSON(data);

         // Update the DOM to show the new alerts!
         if (response.friendRequests &gt; 0) {
            // update the number in the DOM and make sure it is visible...
            $('#unreadFriendRequestsNum').show().text(response.friendRequests);
         }
         else {
            // Hide the number, since there are no pending friend requests
            $('#unreadFriendRequestsNum').hide();
         }

         // Do something similar for unreadMessages, if required...
      }
   });
   setTimeout('updateAlerts()', 15000); // Every 15 seconds.
}

});
</code></pre>

<p>This will, every 15 seconds, make a request to your server at the url /check.php on the same domain as the origin of the webpage.  The PHP should query your database and and return the number of unread friend requests.  Perhaps something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

   function isValid(session) {
      // given the user's session object, ensure it is valid 
      // and that there's no funny business
      // TO BE IMPLEMENTED
   }

   function sanitize(input) {
      // return CLEAN input
      // TO BE IMPLEMENTED
   }

   // Be sure to check that your user's session is valid before proceeding, 
   // we don't want people checking other people's friend requests!
   if (!isValid(session)) { exit; }

   $method = sanitize($_POST['method']);

   switch ($method) {
      case 'checkAlerts' :
         // Check DB for number of unread friend requests and or unread messages
         // TO BE IMPLEMENTED

         $response = ['friendRequests' =&gt; $num_friend_requests,
                      'messages' =&gt; $num_unread_messages ];

         return json_encode( $response );
         exit;

      case 'someOtherMethodIfRequired' :
         // ...
         exit;
   }

<p>The image base is the ""preferred address of the first byte of the image when it is loaded in memory"".  In other words, it's the virtual address of the image when it gets loaded assuming there's not a conflict.  If there is an address conflict when the image is loaded (e.g. another image is already loaded in an overlapping range), then a new base address will be chosen for the image.</p>

<p>An RVA is a relative virtual address.  It is ""relative"" in the sense that it is changed when the image is actually loaded.  It's the address when the base address is not known (e.g. when the image isn't loaded).  Once the image is loaded, the RVA becomes a virtual address (VA), an actual address in virtual memory.</p>

<p>The raw vs. RVA distinction is due to alignment.  There is section alignment (the alignment of the sections when they get loaded into memory) as well as file alignment (the alignment of the raw data in the sections).  The section alignment here is 0x1000 while the file alignment is 0x200.</p>

<p>The entry point RVA is used to determine the VA of the entry point when the image is loaded (i.e. the entry point will be located at virtual address <code>EntryPoint (rva) + ImageBase</code>).  The entry point raw address is the offset into the file where the entry point is located.</p>

The best decision that I see is to set image in MainDiv with <code>background</code> option and just put infPanel inside MainDiv, but because of some technical requirements it is better to post image through just  tag.</p>

<p>Another solution is to use  <code>position: absolute;</code> and with JS set the position for each infPanel, but it will be great to eliminate JS.</p>

<p>Can you suggest more ""agile"" solution? Thank you.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

<pre><code>element{margin-top:-100px;}

<p>will ""move"" the element 100 pixels to the top, overlapping other element.</p>

<p>Note that <code>margin-top</code> with negative values works also well with <code>position:absolute;</code> if you need to specify a <code>z-index</code> to reorder elements. It means that instead of specifying the <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> for each element, you will ""move"" the element to the top, according to its actual position (whereas <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> fix the position according to the page).</p>

<pre><code>\setcounter{secnumdepth}{5}

<p>Since you said you are writing your Thesis, is it possible that you are using a style given by the college/university?</p>

<p>There is still a way to change it. You can use the package tocloft,</p>

<pre><code>\usepackage{tocloft}
</code></pre>

<p>which has a method called \@dotsep to change the amount of space between the dots. Although I do not know if it will work in this case as you only define it once for the whole TOC and if it is relative to what you have it may just increase your dots relative to the way it is already placed.</p>

<p>But here is the code anyways,</p>

<pre><code>\makeatletter \renewcommand{\@dotsep}{4.5} \makeatother
\tableofcontents
</code></pre>

<p>It must be placed before your toc command and 4.5 represents the distance.</p>

<p>But like I said this depends on your document class and its style class.

"3747591","<p>So now I want to make Estonian wordlist ~about 20m unique words in lowercase. To get input for wordlist, <a href=""http://www.keeletehnoloogia.ee/projektid/koondkorpus/koondkorpus?set_language=et"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">corpus of Estonian</a> can be used. Corpus files are in Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) format. I tried using regex to find the words. </p>

<p>This is what I made: it's inefficient, mcv is all messed up, it brakes if hashset of words can't fit in memory, it's not aware of inputs encoding - so probably letters like š make problems, it does not show estimated completion time, some controls have default names and some don't, it does not use multitasking (not sure if it should), it uses some weird fixes and lots of locking interface so that it would appear not 'frozen'. At least its so short, that you hardly notice there are no comments.</p>

<p>Upside is, that it can almost read words without many mistakes, from .tei, .txt, .csv, smgl, xhtml or any a like format inputs.</p>

<p>Now you know what I want to do, how I have tried doing it (with what problems), and again I'm just trying to find out how to do it (with minimal manual labor).</p>

<p>When you create a primary key on two columns in one table, that means it is only required to be unique for both values, i.e. it will allow for any number of rows with the same itemId as long as each userId is different, and vice-versa. </p>

<p>It's the combination of the two that must be unique, not each part of the key individually.</p>

"3748933","<p><b>Answer update, 12/22</b>:
Using Peter Shor's <a href=""https://mathoverflow.net/questions/39429/how-many-non-equivalent-sections-of-a-regular-7-simplex"">observation</a> that there's a homomorphism between distinct sections and permutations of objects on the cube, list all such permutations by representing a group of cube symmetries as a subgroup of SymmetricGroup[8] and using GroupElements/Permute, find centroid assignments using Mathematica's SAT solver, select point sets with distinct singular values, few more details and complete code given <a href=""https://mathematica-bits.blogspot.com/2010/12/listing-interesting-sections-of-simplex.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></p>

<p><b>Question</b></p>

<p>An interesting 2D section is a plane that goes through the center of a regular 3D <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">simplex</a> and 2 other points each of which is a centroid of some non-empty subset of vertices. It is defined by two subsets of vertices. For instance {{1},{1,2}} gives a plane defined by 3 points -- center of the tetrahedron, first vertex, and average of first and second vertices.</p>

<p>An interesting set of sections is a set in which no two sections define the same plane under vertex relabeling. For instance, set {{{1},{2}},{{3},{4}}} is not interesting. Is there an efficient approach to finding an interesting set of interesting sections? I need something that could generalize to an analogous problem for 3D sections of 7D simplex, and finish overnight.</p>

<p>My attempted approach is below. One problem is that if you ignore geometry, some equivalent sections are going to be retained, so I get 10 sections instead of 3. A bigger problem is that I used brute-force and it definitely doesn't scale and (needs 10^17 comparisons for 7D simplex)</p>

","Listing all interesting sections of a tetrahedron","<algorithm><wolfram-mathematica><geometry>","2010-09-20 05:42:07","1398","4154946","1","<p>The correct programming solution is, in outline:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Observe that centers come in projective pairs -- so identify and only retain the half of the centers that are in one or the other hemispherical covers of the set of centers.  Pairs are set complements of each other.  An example rule: all subsets containing vertex 1, and of those on the ""equator"", those containing vertex 2, and on that set's ""equator"", those containing vertex 3, and so on recursively keeping the boundary half adjacent to the smallest indexed vertex.</li>
<li>Observe that for every subsimplex, either the subsimplex is adjacent to vertex 1 or it is of distance 1 away from simplex.  (Cause: each new vertex in the tetrahedron is attached to every previous vertex of the tetrahedron -- consequently every subsimplex is either incident on vertex 1 or vertex 1 is connected to every vertex in the simplex.)  Consequently there are only two populations of each kind of subsimplex (with respect to a specified vertex).  (We can replace this observation with the decision to only keep the smaller member of each projective pair, but then the rule for labeling vertices is more complicated.)</li>
<li><p>Tetrahedra are completely symmetric under permutation of vertex labels.  Consequently, any ""interesting section"" is equivalent to another section containing only the leading segment of vertices -- i.e. can be identified among the vertices Range[1,n] for some n.</p></li>
<li><p>Collecting the above, we find that there is a surjection from interesting section to a set of graphs.  For each graph we must enumerate consistent vertex memberships (described later).  Except for one vertex, the vertices of the graph come in pairs</p>

<ul>
<li>The pair contains all centers of a given cardinality (all subsimplices of a given dimension).</li>
<li>One member of the pair contains centers incident on vertex 1.</li>
<li>The other member of the pair contains centers not incident on vertex 1.</li>
<li>The special vertex is either the center containing all vertices or its projective pair (the ""empty center"").</li>
<li>If a graph contains any member of a pair it must (at least) contain the member containing centers incident on 1 (or the vertices can be relabeled to make this so).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The edges of the graph are weighted.  The weight is the number of vertices shared by the two centers.  There are restrictions on the weight based on the cardinality of the centers at each end and based on whether the two vertices are both first members, both second members, or are one of each.  (""One of each"" can't share vertex 1, for instance.)</li>
<li>A graph is a complete subgraph on the set of vertices, containing the special vertex.  For instance for the tetrahedron, a graph is a K_{3} on the set of vertices identified above, with one vertex the special one and with edge weights.</li>
<li>A section is a graph with a consistent application of labels to the centers at the end of each edge (i.e. consistently labeled to respect the number of shared vertices indicated by the edge's weight and that each subset in one set of graph vertices contains vertex 1).  A given graph can therefore represent multiple sections (via different labelings).  (That there aren't as many options as it sounds as if there are will make sense in a second.)</li>
<li>A section is not interesting if the matrix made from the coordinates of its centers has zero determinant.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the case of three dimensions, with four vertices, we get the following sets (we use the short projective pair because there's enough visibility in this example to not necessitate the simpler vertex labeling rejection rule):<br>
0: projective pair of {1,2,3,4}<br>
1: {1}<br>
1': {2},{3},{4}<br>
2: {1,2},{1,3},{1,4}<br>
2': projective pairs to 2 (so omitted)<br>
3: projective pairs to 1' (so omitted)<br>
3': projective pairs to 1 (so omitted)  </p>

<p>Label constraints:<br>
{0->x,x}<br>
{0->x',x}<br>
{1->1,1} -- disallowed: centers are not included twice<br>
{1->1',0}<br>
{1->2,1}<br>
{2->2,1}<br>
No other weights are possible with these graph vertices.</p>

<p>A graph is a K_{3} incident on 0, the following graphs survive the graph selection rules:<br>
A: {0->1,1},{0->1',1},{1->1',0}<br>
B: {0->2,2},{0->2,2},{2->2,1}</p>

<p>A has only one labeling: {1},{2},{} and is your triangular interesting set.  This labeling does not have zero determinant.<br>
B has only one labeling: {1,2},{1,3},{} and is your square interesting set.  This labeling does not have zero determinant.</p>

<p>Converting to code is left as an exercise to the reader (because I have to leave for work).</p>

<pre><code>c = Image.open(f)
c = c.convert(""RGBA"")
w, h = c.size
cnt = 0
for px in c.getdata():
    c.putpixel((int(cnt % w), int(cnt / w)), (255, 0, 0, px[3]))
    cnt += 1

<p>What I am trying to do is take various PNG images that consist of a single color, white.  Each pixel is 100% white with various alpha values, including alpha = 0.  What I want to do is basically colorize the image with a new set color, for instance #ff0000&lt;00-ff>.  SO my starting and resulting images would look like this where the left side is my starting image and the right is my ending image (NOTE: background has been changed to a light gray so you can see it since it is actually transparent and you wouldn't be able to see the dots on the left.)</p>

","CSS opera problem with <select> tag","<html><css>","2010-09-20 16:38:46","2157","3754188","1","<p>Styling form elements consistently with pure CSS across every browser is more or less impossible. The reason is that, to some degree, elements like form controls and scrollbars are considered part of the operating system (Windows, OS X, etc.) interface. After that, the way they look is further determined by each individual browser. Each browser then allows only some aspects of some form controls to be manipulated with CSS. They do not implement this in a standard way across each browser.</p>

<p>As <b>jcubic</b> mentioned in a comment, you can use JavaScript (like Dojo Toolkit does) to create custom form elements. However, you need to be aware that with <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> elements, this is usually accomplished by replacing the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> with a text <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>. Then JavaScript is used to add functionality that attempts to mimic a real <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>. While this sounds fine in theory, the functionality never fully matches a real <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> and tends to create usability concerns because these custom elements don't quite behave the way users expect a <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> to work.</p>

<p>The best advice you'll ever get is just find a way to incorporate the default form control appearance into your design.</p>

Not sure it's necessary, but I included my code where I load the textures. After trial and error, I found that having symmetrical dimensions freom 0 to 512 gets the best results, but they still aren't perfect (and the dimensions have to be powers of two, or it crashes).

<li>the black at the bottom of the shere comes from the face that captured the front view. It should be at the top (ie it's either flipped, or rotated 180).</li>
<li>likewise, the black that comes from the back of the view (in the center of the sphere) looks turned by a quarter of a circle (as black goes on the left rather than being on the top).</li>
<li>the reflection of the map sphere looks weird. It lacks resolution to figure out exactly what this is.</li>

<p>Anyways, to fix it, you can either make sure your values are what is expected from a proper cube-map definition (as in check all the specification), or just do a bunch of trial and error, after adding enough geometry to figure out what the orientation of each face is.</p>

This is the relevant piece of source in code, and I was wondering if writing large byte arrays all at once to the response output stream could cause this issue. The issue is very much non-reproducible, and I've often seen the pattern of writing a certain number of bytes at a time, versus all at once, to avoid MTU issues, or something like that.</p>

<p>Could this code be responsible for my intermittent IE issues? If so, why, and why only in IE?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>I tried using <code>Cache-Control: no-cache</code>, and the results were catastrophic in IE.</p>

<p>I've seen this behavior in IE a lot, and always has to do with IE's implementation of caching, instead of sending a HEAD request to check contents' validity, it sends the full GET request and then uses headers to determine the validity of its cached content, if it decides the cached version is valid, then just closes the connection, so a lot of ""broken pipe"" style errors show up on server side.</p>

<p>To verify this is the case, try sending cache control headers so IE always has to download the full content.</p>

"3756920","<p>I know this is probably a <em>very</em> simple question, but I can't seem to figure it out. First of all, I want to specify that I did look over Google and SO for half an hour or so without finding the answer to my question(yes, I am serious).</p>

<p>Basically, I want to rotate a Vector2 around a point(which, in my case, is always the (0, 0) vector). So, I tried to make a function to do it with the parameters being the point to rotate and the angle(in degrees) to rotate by.</p>

<p>Here's a quick drawing showing what I'm trying to achieve:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/8RiGa.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I want to take V1(red vector), rotate it by an angle A(blue), to obtain a new vector (V2, green). In this example I used one of the simplest case: V1 on the axis, and a 90 degree angle, but I want the function to handle more ""<em>complicated</em>"" cases too.</p>

<p>So here's my function:</p>

<pre><code>public static Vector2 RotateVector2(Vector2 point, float degrees)
{
    return Vector2.Transform(point, 
    Matrix.CreateRotationZ(MathHelper.ToRadians(degrees)));
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, what am I doing wrong? When I run the code and call this function with the (0, -1) vector and a 90 degrees angle, I get the vector (1, 4.371139E-08) ...</p>

<p>Also, what if I want to accept a point to rotate around as a parameter too? So that the rotation doesn't always happen around (0, 0)...</p>

I suggest an alternate implementation for RotateVector2 and answer the second part of your question.</p>

<p>Building a 4x4 rotation matrix to rotate a vector will cause a lot of unnecessary operations.  The matrix transform is actually doing the following but using a lot of redundant math:</p>

<pre><code>    public static Vector2 RotateVector2(Vector2 point, float radians)
    {
        float cosRadians = (float)Math.Cos(radians);
        float sinRadians = (float)Math.Sin(radians);

        return new Vector2(
            point.X * cosRadians - point.Y * sinRadians,
            point.X * sinRadians + point.Y * cosRadians);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to rotate around an arbitrary point, you first need to translate your space so that the point to be rotated around is the origin, do the rotation and then reverse the translation.</p>

<pre><code>    public static Vector2 RotateVector2(Vector2 point, float radians, Vector2 pivot)
    {
        float cosRadians = (float)Math.Cos(radians);
        float sinRadians = (float)Math.Sin(radians);

        Vector2 translatedPoint = new Vector2();
        translatedPoint.X = point.X - pivot.X;
        translatedPoint.Y = point.Y - pivot.Y;

        Vector2 rotatedPoint = new Vector2();
        rotatedPoint.X = translatedPoint.X * cosRadians - translatedPoint.Y * sinRadians + pivot.X;
        rotatedPoint.Y = translatedPoint.X * sinRadians + translatedPoint.Y * cosRadians + pivot.Y;

        return rotatedPoint;
    }

"3759013","<p>What is the best way to make something like a mask with rounded corners for an image using CSS/JS/HTML? So, I need to add rounded corners to a rectangle image. I thought about adding 4 graphic elements like this one <img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/hM3YJ.png"" alt=""alt text""> above the image at its corners to hide some little parts of the image. Here red color is, for example, for using on the red background page, and the element is for right top corner. The problem with this solution is that I can't use it on complex backgrounds, like gradients or other non-flat fill background.
I know there is a masking feature that can be used in FireFox but I need some more generic solution that will work in other browsers well too. Thanks.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can do it the hard way (although it's not too hard in the scheme of things), and change the XAP file's .xap extension to .zip and unzip it.  To make this process easier, you can associate the .xap extension with your zip tool, enabling you to browse the contents of a .xap file right within the zip tool.  Of course, that doesn't provide all the other additional features that Silverlight Spy includes :).</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>I would like to have a function like this: f(key) -> result_row.</p>

<p>That means: given a search key (01, 2, 4, TextA), the function should tell me that the matching row is 3 in the example above.</p>

<p>The values in the search key (A, B, C, D) are a unique identifier.</p>

<p>How do I get the row number of the matching row?</p>

<p><strong>One solution</strong></p>

<p>The solution that comes first to my mind is to use Visual Basic for Application (VBA) to scan column A for ""01"". Once I've found a cell containing ""01"", I'd check the adjacent cells in columns B, C and D whether they match my search criteria.</p>

<p>I guess that algorithm will work. But: is there a better solution?</p>

<p><strong>Version</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Excel 2000 9.0.8961 SP3</li>
<li>VBA 6.5</li>
</ul>

<p>However, if you happen to know a solution in any higher versions of Excel or VBA, I am curious to know as well.</p>

<p>Here is the solution I prototyped. It's all hard-coded, too verbose and not a function as in MikeD's solution. But I'll rewrite it in my actual application to take parameters and to return a result value.</p>

"3764124","<p>I have a VB6 project that references COMSVCSLib and one of the methods makes calls to COMSVCSLib's SharedPropertyGroupManager.CreatePropertyGroup passing <strong>LockMethod</strong> and <strong>Process</strong> as parameters.</p>

<p><strong>Cleaned up VB6 code:</strong></p>

<pre><code>Dim groupName       As String
Dim spmMgr          As COMSVCSLib.SharedPropertyGroupManager
Dim spmGroup        As COMSVCSLib.SharedPropertyGroup

Set spmMgr = New COMSVCSLib.SharedPropertyGroupManager

With spmMgr
    Set spmGroup = .CreatePropertyGroup(groupName, LockMethod, Process, bGroupExists)

</code></pre>

<p>Having not worked with VB6 for several years now, at first I thought LockMethod and Process were variables or constants defined somewhere else within the project.</p>

<p>After a little research on the Object Browser I found out that they were both being exposed as constants in COMSVCSLib.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/uyjaC.png"" alt=""Object Browser""></p>

<p>But looking at their definition in OLE/COM Object Viewer, they seem to be defined as values of an enumeration:</p>

<pre><code>typedef enum {
    LockSetGet = 0,
    LockMethod = 1
} __MIDL___MIDL_itf_autosvcs_0469_0002;
</code></pre>

","Why aren't TypeLib enums exposed as enums in Visual Basic 6.0?","<vb6><enums><constants><typelib>","2010-09-21 20:17:51","2645","3765337","2","<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <em>I'm not an expert on IDL (Interface Definition Language, which is the language used to define COM types) or the Microsoft IDL compiler (MIDL), but I came to the conclusions below after playing around with the type library for scrrun.dll, which has a similar problem with enum's. Some of this information was gleaned from a quick look at this DevX article on IDL and VB6: <a href=""http://www.devx.com/vb2themax/Article/19830/1954"" rel=""noreferrer"">IDL for VB Tutorial</a></em></p>

<p>VB6 expects the actual enum to have a name, not just a enum that is <code>typedef</code>'d to a name. The <code>__MIDL___MIDL_itf_autosvcs_0469_0002</code> name is a placeholder, since the original typelib didn't define the enum name in the same <code>typedef</code> where the enum constants are defined.</p>

<p>When you view the type library in OLE Viewer, the <code>enum</code> probably looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>typedef [public] __MIDL___MIDL_itf_autosvcs_0469_0002 LockModes;

typedef enum {
    LockSetGet = 0,
    LockMethod = 1
} __MIDL___MIDL_itf_autosvcs_0469_0002;
</code></pre>

<p>The first <code>typedef</code> creates the public name <code>LockModes</code> as an alias for the auto-generated <code>MIDL___MIDL_itf_autosvcs_0469_0002</code> name that was given to the <code>enum</code>. When the original type libary was compiled, the <code>midl</code> compiler generated the long <code>__MIDL</code> name for the original <code>enum</code> and automatically created a <code>typedef</code> alias pointing back to it. </p>

<p>The original IDL probably defined the enum like this:</p>

<pre><code>typedef enum {
     LockSetGet = 0,
     LockMethod = 1
} LockModes;
</code></pre>

<p>When the <code>midl</code> compiler processes an <code>enum</code> definition written this way, it auto-generates a name for the <code>enum</code> (since it is missing - it should appear after the <code>enum</code> keyword). This is what the <code>__MIDL</code> name is that you see when you view the type library in OLE Viewer. The <code>midl</code> compiler also automatically generates a second <code>typedef</code> that aliases the <code>typedef</code> name to the auto-generated <code>enum</code> name.</p>

<p>The problem is that VB6 can't understand enum's that are created this way. It expects everything to be in a single <code>typedef</code> (i.e. you give the <code>enum</code> a name, as well as naming the <code>typedef</code>):</p>

<pre><code>typedef enum LocksMode {
    LockSetGet = 0,
    LockMethod = 1
} LocksMode;
</code></pre>

<p>IDL treats <code>typedef</code>'s the same way that C or C++ does: you don't have to give the enum itself a name, because the <code>typedef</code> already has a name, but you <em>can</em> give the enum a name if you choose. In other words, the <code>typedef</code> and the <code>enum</code> are actually two separate entities. VB6 happens to recognize the <code>typedef</code> and the <code>enum</code> as being two distinct, but vaguely-related things, so in your case it sees a <code>typedef</code> named <code>__MIDL___MIDL_itf_autosvcs_0469_0002</code>, and it sees that this is an alias to an unnamed enum, and it also sees a <code>typedef</code> for <code>LockModes</code>, which is a public alias for the other <code>typedef</code>.</p>

<p>Since the first <code>typedef</code> is public, you will see an entry for <code>LockModes</code> in the Object Browser, and because it is an alias for an enum, you will see the enum constants in the Object Browser as well. However, the <em>actual enum itself</em> does not have a name (so it gets the funky auto-generated name assigned to it in the browser), and VB6 can't use the enum because the auto-generated name happens to be illegal in VB6 (names with double-underscores are automatically hidden in VB6).</p>

<p>To demonstrate that last point, if you type this in your VB6 code, Intellisense will work and it will compile, but obviously, it's not very ideal:</p>

<pre><code>MsgBox COMSVCSLib.[__MIDL___MIDL_itf_autosvcs_0469_0002].LockMethod
</code></pre>

<p>The reason this code works is because you can put names that normally cause syntax errors (such as names that start with underscores) in brackets to allow VB6 to accept the normally-illegal name. In addition, prefixing the constants with the auto-generated name works with Intellisense because it is the actual name that VB6 associates with the <code>enum</code> (remember the other <code>typedef</code> is just an alias back to this ""real"", but auto-generated name, and VB6 apparently can't put all the pieces together to realize both names refer to the same <code>enum</code>).</p>

<p>Rather than typing out the ridiculously-long name like above, you can also access <code>enum</code> constants by prefixing them with the library name, for example, <code>COMSVCSLib.LockMethod</code> should work. It's less clear to me why this actually works, and I'm not sure what would happen if two different <code>enum</code>'s define constants with the same name.</p>

<p>Lastly, you could fix this problem a different way by using the IDL from the OLE Viewer to create a custom IDL file, in which you replace the existing <code>enum</code> typedefs with a single <code>typedef</code> for each <code>enum</code> that simply gives both the <code>enum</code> and the <code>typedef</code> the same name (i.e. <code>typedef enum LockModes { ... } LockModes;</code>), but since the OLE Viewer doesn't necessarily generate valid IDL, you would probably have to tweak it even more to get it to actually compile. If you can get this to work, then you can reference your custom <code>.tlb</code> from your VB6 project (instead of the <code>COMSVCSLib</code> library), and the <code>enum</code>'s will work like you would expect them to.</p>

<p>If you want to go that route, there are two other tools you need, which should already been installed on your development machine (but you may need to search for them):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>midl.exe</code>: This tool can generate a typelib file (*.tlb) from a <code>.idl</code> file. So you could copy the IDL from the OLE Viewer into Notepad, modify the enum definitions as described above, save it as a <code>.idl</code> file, and pass it to <code>midl.exe</code> to make a new typelib:</p>

<p><code>midl my-custom-typelib.idl</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>regtlib.exe</code>: This tool can register a .tlb file, which is required if you want to be able to add it as a reference to your VB6 project:</p>

<p><code>regtlib.exe my-custom-typelib.tlb</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>However, creating a custom typelib for this is probably overkill, and as already mentioned, it might be hard to get a compilable IDL file based off the output from the OLE Viewer, since it displays reverse-engineered IDL for the type library, not the original IDL.</p>

  <p>Why does my JVM heap size thrash from 2gigs to 8 gigs?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no evidence that the system is thrashing in the normal (harmful) sense.  The sawtooth pattern indicates that objects are being allocated (the up slope) and the GC is then reclaiming them.  The allocation rate seems a bit high, but there is every sign that the GC is running efficiently.  Indeed, the fact that the heap size is always dropping back to ~2Gb is a good sign, as is the fact that the % CPU usage is low.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It looks kind of normal.  </p>

<p>Certainly, there's no need to increase the size of permGen.  (PermGen is used for objects that are anticipated to never be garbage collected; typically intern'd Strings<sup>1</sup> and code segments.  Normal application objects are never allocated in or moved to permgen space.)</p>

<p>Hypothetically, if you <em>didn't</em> have lots of memory, the high allocation rate might be a cause for concern.  However, you cannot address that by tweaking the GC parameters.  You'd need to do some profiling to see what is creating so many objects and see if it is sensible to try to reduce the creation rate.  Depending on the application, it may not even be sensible to try.</p>

<ul>
<li>If multiple columns are required, they should contain no less than 5 (except for the last column in case of a remainder) and no more than 10 items.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If all columns cannot contain an equal number of items

For instance, your second example could be divided into two columns with 11 items in each, and satisfy your criteria. Let's assume that for rule #2 you meant that there should be &lt;= 10 items / column. </p>

<p>In addition, I think you need to add another rule to make the requirements sensible:</p>

<p><code>The number of columns must not be greater than what is required to accomodate overflow.</code></p>

<p>Otherwise, you will often end up with degenerate solutions where you have far more columns than you need. For example, in the case of 26 items you probably don't want 13 columns of 2 items each.</p>

<p>If that's case, here's a simple calculation that should work well and is easy to understand:</p>

<pre><code>int numberOfColumns = CEILING(numberOfItems / 10);
int numberOfItemsPerColumn = CEILING(numberOfItems / numberOfColumns);
</code></pre>

<p>Now you'll create N-1 columns of items (having `numberOfItemsPerColumn each) and the overflow will go in the last column. By this definition, the overflow should be minimized in the last column.</p>

"3771587","<p>I'm a bit stuck on this SCJP practice question, specifically line 5 (with the String constructor). I thought it should be private, but the solution is 'protected'. I think protected access would not satisfy the requirement that all Alpha instances have the String alpha set to A. If the constructor is protected, then any other class that's also in package alpha, OR any subclass of Alpha regardless of package, can invoke it and set alpha to whatever it wants. Amirite? Can anyone clarify? Thanks!</p>

<p>So it can't be private... but you're right: if it's <code>protected</code> then other types in the same package could indeed call</p>

<pre><code>new Alpha(""some other value"")
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, I don't believe <code>private</code> is the right answer, but I don't believe there <em>is</em> a right answer. You can't limit visibility to <em>only</em> derived classes in Java.</p>

<p>EDIT: I've got it :)</p>

<p>Make <code>Alpha</code> abstract, and do what you like with the constructor, so long as it's visible to <code>Beta</code> (<code>public</code> or <code>protected</code> is fine). That way the third condition is automatically true, because there will <em>never</em> be any instances of just <code>Alpha</code>!</p>

<pre><code>package alpha;
public abstract class Alpha {
    final String alpha;
    Alpha() { this(""A""); }
    public Alpha(String a) { alpha = a; }

package beta;

public class Beta extends alpha.Alpha {
    public Beta(String a) { super(a); }
}

<p>Now, this <em>does</em> require a bit of a weaselly interpretation of point 1. I would argue that an instance of <code>Beta</code> <em>is an instance of <code>Alpha</code></em> (after all, <code>instanceof</code> will return true :) so that satisfies point 1, but an instance of <code>Beta</code> is not ""an object of type <code>Alpha</code>"" so point 3 is still okay.</p>

<p>I also tried creating a custom panel that only shows one ""selected"" item at a time and shows all of the items in a drop-down when you click on it (basically a ""ComboBox"" panel). I ran into trouble because visuals can only be in one place in the visual tree. So putting the children of the panel into a popup caused an exception to be thrown.</p>

<p>Anybody have any other ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>I created a custom Control class (MasterDetailControl). </p>

<p>This class has two template parts:</p>

<pre><code>[TemplatePart(Name = ""PART_MasterSelector"", Type = typeof(Selector))]
[TemplatePart(Name = ""PART_DetailPresenter"", Type = typeof(ContentPresenter))]
</code></pre>

<p>The control has an items dependency property:</p>

<pre><code>public IList Items { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>I added a helper class: </p>

<pre><code>[ContentProperty(""Detail"")]
public class MasterDetail
{
   public object Master { get; set; }
   public object Detail { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Items that are placed in the Items DP are processed by the MasterDetailControl. If they are of type MasterDetail, the master is added to the selector items list. For other child item types, a new MasterDetail object is created with the object assigned to the master and detail fields. A separate list maintains all of the generated MasterDetail objects with indexes that correspond to those in the Selector control.</p>

<p>When the SelectionChanged event fires on the Selector object, I set the ContentPresenter's Content property to the Detail field of the item corresponding to the selected master object. </p>

<p>If anyone wants more details, feel free to comment.</p>

<p>In the end, I can now use this control with a simple control template specifying any selector object (ListBox, ComboBox, etc) and a ContentPresenter.</p>

The downside (too big in my opinion) is that any browser that doesn't support <code>text-shadow</code> but supports <code>rgba</code> (IE 9) won't render the text unless you use a library such as Modernizr (not tested, just a theory).</p>

<p>Firefox uses the text color to determine the color of the dotted border. So say if you do...</p>

<pre><code>select {
  color: rgba(0,0,0,0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Firefox will render the dotted border transparent. But of course your text will be transparent too! So we must somehow display the text. <code>text-shadow</code> comes to the rescue:</p>

<pre><code>select {
  color: rgba(0,0,0,0);
  text-shadow: 0 0 0 #000;
}
</code></pre>

<p>We put a text shadow with no offset and no blur, so that replaces the text. Of course older browser don't understand anything of this, so we must provide a fallback for the color:</p>

<pre><code>select {
  color: #000;
  color: rgba(0,0,0,0);
  text-shadow: 0 0 0 #000;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is when IE9 comes into play: it supports <code>rgba</code> but not text-shadow, so you will get an apparently empty select box. Get your version of Modernizr with <code>text-shadow</code> detection and do...</p>

<pre><code>.no-textshadow select {

"3773774","<p>I have a very odd problem. Whenever I try to use the ""Add View"" dialog in ASP.NET MVC2 and then try to ""Create a strongly-typed view"" by selecting a ""View data class"" from the drop down of available classes none of the classes (""models"") in my MVC project are showing up.</p>

<p>The MVC Project was referencing a bunch of service contract assemblies that where referencing a ""CommonServiceContractAssembly.dll"". The MVC Project was also referencing ""CommonServiceContractAssembly.dll"". The MVC Project and the service contract assemblies were all built referencing slightly different versions of ""CommonServiceContractAssembly.dll""</p>

<p>When Visual Studio 2010 was reflecting on all referenced assemblies to ""Create a strongly-typed view"" of I believe it wasn't sure how to handle the slightly different version of ""CommonServiceContractAssembly.dll"" being referenced so it didn't display the reflected ""strongly typed model"" possibilities for any assemblies dependent on ""CommonServiceContractAssembly.dll"".</p>

<p>The fix is to actually force Visual Studio 2010's app domain to use the correct version of ""CommonServiceContractAssembly.dll"" when Visual Studio 2010 starts up. This was accomplished with a Post Build Event like the following:</p>

<p>REM This is required for T4 generation from models to work properly
copy ""$(TargetDir)""CommonServiceContractAssembly.dll""  ""$(DevEnvDir)PublicAssemblies\"" /Y</p>

<p>So I copy ""CommonServiceContractAssembly.dll"" that is referenced ""everywhere"" into where Visual Studio will load it. After I did this everything worked properly.</p>

<p>Another option would be to always ensure that all assemblies that share a common dependency are always compiled with the same version of that dependency.</p>

","Simple Threading, why does this happen? (C# WinForms)","<c#><multithreading>","2010-09-23 04:56:09","1321","3775751","3","<p>OK, there are several recommendations:  </p>

<h2>Use a Volatile Flag</h2>

<p>Make your flag volatile... if you don't, then an update to the flag <em>may never</em> be seen by the thread.</p>

<pre><code>volatile bool stopThread = false;
</code></pre>

<h2>Set to Background</h2>

<p>Set the <code>IsBackground</code> property to true: it forces the thread to be terminated if the application exits, otherwise you may get a ""ghost thread"" which exists even after the application has closed.</p>

<pre><code>thread1.IsBackground = true;
thread1.Start();
</code></pre>

<p>If the thread just started sleeping, then you will abort it even before it has had a chance to read the flag... furthermore you don't want to use <code>Abort</code> because:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...if one thread calls Abort on another
  thread, the abort interrupts whatever
  code is running. There is a chance the
  thread could abort while a finally
  block is running, in which case the
  finally  block is aborted. There is
  also a chance that a static
  constructor could be aborted. In rare
  cases, this might prevent instances of
  that class from being created in that
  application domain.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Use Interrupt instead of Abort</h2>

<p>So instead of using abort, I would recommend that you call <code>Interrupt</code> and you handle the exception inside the thread:</p>

<pre><code>private void btnStop_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // have another method for re-use
    StopThread();
}

private void StopThread()
{
    stopThread = true;

    // the time out is 100 ms longer than the thread sleep
    thread1.Join(1100);

    // if the thread is still alive, then interrupt it
    if(thread1.IsAlive)
    {
        thread1.Interrupt();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Don't ""Leak"" Threads</h2>

<p>You're leaking threads every time you click the Start button... if <code>thread1</code> is already assigned a thread and you assign <em>another</em> thread to it, then the previous one will continue to exist. You need to stop the previous thread before you start another one.</p>

<pre><code>private void btnStart_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // stop the previous thread
    StopThread();

    // create a new thread
    stopThread = false;
    thread1 = new Thread(new ThreadStart(disp));
    thread1.IsBackground = true;// set it to background again
    thread1.Start();
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Handle the Interrupt</h2>

<p>Finally, you need to handle the interrupts in your thread:</p>

<pre><code>void disp()
{
    try
    {
        while (stopThread == false)
        {
            listBox1.Invoke(tickerDelegate1, new object[] { DateTime.Now.ToString() });
            Thread.Sleep(1000);
        }
    }
    catch(ThreadInterruptedException)
    {
        // ignore the exception since the thread should terminate
    }
}

<p>So the problem seems to run when I insert my values into my MySQL server. So I thought it might have been my Character Set, which WAS set to Latin1, and now I have moved to  <strong>utf8 -- UTF-8 Unicode</strong></p>

<p>Other factors regarding my MySQL setup:
I have attempted at using field types such as:
varchar, varbinary (where I currently sit), and text with a length of (256 on all). I do have many column fields in my table, and many of them will need to be encrypted, although i'm just testing with 2 until I have everything figured out.</p>

<p>So the glitch that i've run into is when I insert into the Database and I actually look at the value inside my Database I have the characters value, they equal  ¥ÄÎó¸LOI„˜:é0  (although i'm sure the trans-coding on here will modify it) I have inserted a screenshot of the actual value in the database here: 
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/000vg.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>But when I try to DeCrypt the value, I get nothing, and it runs blank. It seems as if there is an issue with any word that starts with a CAPITAL ""G"". if I have a lower case ""g"" it seems to work just fine... </p>

<p>I am completely stumped on this and have no idea how to troubleshoot this anymore. </p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.
PS. I am also curious to know if using PHP AES_Encryption is better or using MySQL AES_ENCRYPT is better?</p>

"3779763","<p>I have a program that needs to repeatedly compute the approximate percentile (order statistic) of a dataset in order to remove outliers before further processing.  I'm currently doing so by sorting the array of values and picking the appropriate element; this is doable, but it's a noticable blip on the profiles despite being a fairly minor part of the program.</p>

<p>More info:</p>

<ul>
<li>The data set contains on the order of up to 100000 floating point numbers, and assumed to be ""reasonably"" distributed - there are unlikely to be duplicates nor huge spikes in density near particular values; and if for some odd reason the distribution is odd, it's OK for an approximation to be less accurate since the data is probably messed up anyhow and further processing dubious.  However, the data isn't necessarily uniformly or normally distributed; it's just very unlikely to be degenerate.</li>
<li>An approximate solution would be fine, but I do need to understand <em>how</em> the approximation introduces error to ensure it's valid.</li>
<li>Since the aim is to remove outliers, I'm computing two percentiles over the same data at all times: e.g. one at 95% and one at 5%.</li>
<li>The app is in C# with bits of heavy lifting in C++; pseudocode or a preexisting library in either would be fine.</li>
<li>An entirely different way of removing outliers would be fine too, as long as it's reasonable.</li>
<li><strong><em>Update:</em></strong> It seems I'm looking for an approximate <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_algorithm"" rel=""noreferrer"">selection algorithm</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although this is all done in a loop, the data is (slightly) different every time, so it's not easy to reuse a datastructure as was done <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3738349/fast-algorithm-for-repeated-calculation-of-percentile"">for this question</a>.</p>

<p>Using the wikipedia selection algorithm as suggested by Gronim reduced this part of the run-time by about a factor 20.</p>

"3783763","<p>I feel like I hit a wall trying to structure what I thought would be a simple database schema for modeling basic financial transactions. I'm hoping some of you with more experience can weigh in and point me in the right direction.</p>

<p>My application has four distinctly different types of leases that customers can purchase. As such, each type of lease has it's own table, and in order to keep referential integrity, each lease table has it's own transactions table.</p>

<p>My original sketch looked like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ahkBD.png"" /></p>

<p>First off, I used a FK reference to Function Types to avoid using signed integers. It makes no sense to have a negative payment, so I figured it would work well for each transaction to have either a debit or credit reference. Does this make sense?</p>

<p>Another thing that was bothering me is that all transactions don't appear to be equal. That is, I feel like the transctions for this application should possibly be grouped into separate tables.</p>

<p>Should transactions such as flat rate fees, variable rate fees, payments, interest and voids all be stuffed into the same table? It seems messy to me, but I'm already stuck with a transactions table for each lease type so splitting those tables up even more is not very appealing.</p>

<p>Just about every transaction type other than payments will be built programmatically, so I can have references in the ""Notes"" field that specifies which payment a bounced check or void transaction is referencing. Is this good enough or am I thinking about this all wrong?</p>

This also lets you do things like record a charge-back due to a mistake (e.g., charging the wrong account on the customer's card) as a negative payment, which is different to a refund.</p>

Frameworks allow to keep your code concise, develop faster and also insulate you from the cross-browser compatibility issues.</p>

<p>Using jQuery your code would have been something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;

    $.ajax({
      url: 'http://localhost:8000/test/',
      success: function(data) {
        $('#thediv').html(data); //jQuery equivalent of  document.getElementById('thediv').innerHTML = data

<p>Since jQuery provides with a default <code>$()</code> function, you do not need to define them in your code in case you use the framework.</p>

<p>Though this answer is slightly off-track, I hope it will be useful to you.</p>

<p>Reading about SuperFetch, games users on Vista <a href=""http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/how-to-disable-superfetch-on-windows-vista/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">often say</a> turning it off improves performance.

<blockquote>
  <p>This is interesting. Well, I've looked
  at the ComboBox class using Reflector
  and I see that in the
  ComboBox.UpdateSelectionBoxItems()
  method, part of it does something
  like:</p>
  
  <p>If ItemTemplate, ItemTemplateSelector,
  and ItemStringFormat were not set, and
  selected item is a DependencyObject
  that is not derived from UIElement,
  call the ExtractString(selectedItem)
  method.</p>
  
  <p>The ComboBox.ExtractString(dObj)
  method, on the other hand, apparently
  checks to see if the selectedItem
  (which is a DependencyObject) is
  either a TextBlock, a Visual, or a
  TextElement to display the appropriate
  string. Otherwise, it will return
  string.Empty.</p>

<p>So the easiest solution would be to set this on the Combobox:</p>

In this tip two UIBarButtonItems are put together in a UIToolbar. Finally, the UIToolbar is added to the UINavigationBar. Now to my problems:</p>

<p>1) A white line is on top of the UIToolbar. If I increase the size of the UIToolbar, the gradient is wrong. I'm using the following size for the UIToolbar:</p>

<pre><code>    UIToolbar *toolbar = [[UIToolbar alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 90, 44.01)];
</code></pre>

<p>How can I get rid of the white line? See here:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/xTkS4.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The problem is that there is a white instead of a grey line. If it would be grey, everything would be perfect.</p>

<p>2) What about the difference of the display size of iPhone 3 and iPhone 4? Do I have to check which iPhone is used and then double the size?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>The buttons are created like in the following example I took from the above mentioned website:</p>

<pre><code>// create a toolbar to have two buttons in the right
UIToolbar* tools = [[UIToolbar alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 133, 44.01)];

// create the array to hold the buttons, which then gets added to the toolbar
NSMutableArray* buttons = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithCapacity:3];

// create a standard ""add"" button
UIBarButtonItem* bi = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc]
initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemAdd target:self action:NULL];
bi.style = UIBarButtonItemStyleBordered;
[buttons addObject:bi];
[bi release];

// create a spacer
bi = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc]
initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemFixedSpace target:nil action:nil];
[buttons addObject:bi];
[bi release];

// create a standard ""refresh"" button
bi = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc]
initWithBarButtonSystemItem:UIBarButtonSystemItemRefresh target:self action:@selector(refresh:)];
bi.style = UIBarButtonItemStyleBordered;
[buttons addObject:bi];
[bi release];

// stick the buttons in the toolbar
[tools setItems:buttons animated:NO];

[buttons release];

// and put the toolbar in the nav bar
self.navigationItem.rightBarButtonItem = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithCustomView:tools];
[tools release];

"3791024","<p>jQuery.validate doesn't seem to change the background color of the invalid element by default. Is it also possible to change the background color of a <code>select</code> element? Most of my elements are <code>input type=""text""</code>, but I need an indicator for the select form elements. I am <strong>not</strong> using the default generated messages, as they don't fit my layout.</p>

<p>The following code <em>does</em> change the background color of the <code>input</code> elements, but it never reverts to its previous style:</p>

<pre>

        errorClass: 'jqInvalid',
        rules: {
            fnameCreate: ""required"", //input
            monthCreate: ""required"", //select
            emailCreate: { required: true, email: true }, //input
            passwordCreate: ""required"", //input type=password
        },
        messages: {
            fnameCreate: """",
            monthCreate: """",
            emailCreate: """",
            passwordCreate: """",
        },
        errorPlacement: function (error, element) {
            element.css('background', '#ffdddd');
        }
    });
</pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> (sample)</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""field""&gt;
  &lt;div class=""labelName_fb""&gt;
    &lt;label for=""email""&gt;Email&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""divforText3""&gt;
    &lt;div class=""divLeft""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""textbox-image3""&gt;
      &lt;input class=""txt required"" id=""emailCreate"" name=""emailCreate"" value="""" maxlength=""100"" type=""text""  style='width:180px'&gt;

"3791173","<p>I am new to OpenGL. I am using JOGL.</p>

<p>I downloaded this <a href=""http://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/3d-mitsubishi-l200/394290"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">model</a>. It has a bunch of textures. I'm trying to apply ""truck_color-blue.jpg"" here, but I'm not sure I'm doing it right. This is what I'm seeing:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/E0HbH.png"" alt=""Side by side: by texture and the site&#39;s demo""></p>

<p>Essentially, what I am doing is recording all the <code>vt</code>, <code>v</code>, and <code>vn</code> entries, then using the <code>f</code> lines to index into them. This is the code that makes the <code>glTexCoord*()</code> call:</p>

<pre><code>           if (facePoint.textureIndex != null) {
                Vector2f texCoords = getTexture(facePoint.textureIndex);

            Point3f vertex = getVertex(facePoint.vertexIndex);
            gl.glVertex3f(vertex.x, vertex.y, vertex.z);

"3791372","<p>I've encountered a strange error when attempting to update a SharePoint 2010 list that I have linked to via Microsoft Access 2010.</p>

<p>Error: Data cannot be inserted because there is no matching record.</p>

<ol>
<li>I attempt to run any UPDATE query against the list in MS Access</li>
<li>I attempt to update a record from the list if the list view is filtered</li>
</ol>

<p>The second item might need an explanation. If I simply open the linked list in Access, scroll down to a record I want to edit, and edit it, it works. If I filter that view first (for example, showing only records with a checkbox field checked), I cannot edit any records and get the error.</p>

<p>This only happens in one particular environment; others work fine with either approach. I've checked permissions (I have full control of the list, I am a Site Collection Administrator, etc.). I have tried linking to the list in various ways: from within Access, from the ""Open with Access"" ribbon button in SharePoint. I've deleted and recreated the Access DB file... no luck.</p>

<p>Also, Google has no knowledge of this particular error: searches for the exact error text come up with 0 results.</p>

<p>Any idea what to check? Running SQL-style queries against this SharePoint list is the only viable option for maintaining it.</p>

As I was manually editing some more records in the ""unfiltered"" view of my SharePoint list, I found that the occasional record would still not update and throw the same error. </p>

<p>I happened to notice the records that would not update had another column set, which was a lookup column (you're right, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/2548/remou"">Remou</a>). But oddly, the ID value was displaying and not the lookup value. This didn't make sense, as MS Access had also linked all related lists.</p>

<p>I opened up the appropriate lookup list only to find Access was not retrieving any of the values. This again was odd, because the values existed in SharePoint, and the lookup relationship was intact were you to edit the same record in SharePoint. I couldn't force Access to update or fix its connection to the list.</p>

<p>I ended up deleting the lookup SharePoint list and recreating it. This solved the MS Access problem.</p>

"3791591","<p>I'm just testing this stuff out, so I don't need an alternate approach (no GL extensions). Just hoping someone sees an obvious mistake in my usage of GLES.</p>

<p>I want to take an bitmap of a glyph that is smaller than 32x32 (width and height are not necessarily powers of 2) and put it into a texture so I can render it. I've first created an empty 32x32 texture then I copy the pixels into the larger texture.</p>

<pre><code>Gluint texture;
glGenTextures(1, &amp;texture);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture);

glPixelStorei(GL_UNPACK_ALIGNMENT, 1);
glTextImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_ALPHA, 32, 32, 0,
              GL_ALPHA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE NULL);
glTexSubImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, 0, bitmap.width(), bitmap.height(),
                GL_ALPHA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, bitmap.pixels());

glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_NEAREST);
glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_NEAREST);
glTexParamteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
glTexParamteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
</code></pre>

<p>Then I try to draw only the bitmap portion of the texture using the texture coordinates:</p>

<pre><code>const GLfloat vertices[] = {
  x + bitmap.width(), y + bitmap.height(),
  x, y + bitmap.height(),
  x, y,
  x + bitmap.width(), y
};

const GLfloat texCoords[] = {
  0, bitmap.height() / 32,
  bitmap.width() / 32, bitmap.height() / 32,
  0, 0,
  bitmap.width() / 32, 0
};

const GLushort indices[] = { 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 3 };

glEnableClientState(GL_VERTEX_ARRAY);
glEnableClientState(GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY);
glVertexPointer(2, GL_FLOAT, 0, vertices);
glTexCoordPointer(2, GL_FLOAT, 0, texCoords);

glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, 6, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, indices);
</code></pre>

<p>Now if all were well in the world, the size of the square created by the vertices would be the same size as the bitmap portion of the texture and it would draw my bitmap exactly.</p>

<p>Lets say for example that my glyph was 16x16, then it should take up the bottom left quadrant of the 32x32 texture. Then the texCoords would seem to be correct with (0, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), (0, 0) and (0.5, 0). </p>

<p>However my 12x12 'T' glyph looks like this: <img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/aWGlh.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Anyone know why?</p>

<p>BTW. I start by setting up the projection matrix for 2D work as such:</p>

<pre><code>glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION);
glLoadIdentity();
glOrtho(0.0f, 480, 800, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f);
glDisable(GL_DEPTH_TEST);
glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
glLoadIdentity();
glTranslate(0.375f, 0.375f, 0.0f); // for exact pixelization

glEnable(GL_BLEND);
glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_ALPHA);
glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
glClearColor(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);
</code></pre>

  x, y,
  x + bitmap.width(), y
};
</code></pre>

<p>As an aside: 
I don't think you need to go the route via vertex indices in your case. Easier would be a call to glDrawArrays:</p>

<pre><code>glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, 0, 4);

<p>(as you have already set up your glVertexPointer and glTexCoordPointer).</p>

"3791816","<p>I have a jQuery accordion that I am styling using the ui themes. My question is, how can I have a section that has no sub-sections and does not expand when mouse-overed? I am using mouseover as my trigger.</p>

    $(function () { 
        $(""#accordion"").accordion({

"3793510","<p>I have a few inequalities regarding <code>{x,y}</code>, that satisfies the following equations:</p>

<pre><code>x&gt;=0
y&gt;=0
f(x,y)=x^2+y^2&gt;=100
g(x,y)=x^2+y^2&lt;=200

<p><strong>Note that <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> must be integer.</strong></p>

<p>Graphically it can be represented as follows, the blue region is the region that satisfies the above inequalities:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/JG7r9.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The question now is, is there any function in Matlab that finds every admissible pair of <code>{x,y}</code>? If there is an algorithm to do this kind of thing I would be glad to hear about it as well. </p>

<p>Of course, one approach we can always use is brute force approach where we test every possible combination of <code>{x,y}</code> to see whether the inequalities are satisfied. But this is the last resort, because it's time consuming. I'm looking for a clever algorithm that does this, or in the best case, an existing library that I can use straight-away. </p>

<p>The <code>x^2+y^2&gt;=100</code> <code>and x^2+y^2&lt;=200</code> are just examples; in reality <code>f</code> and <code>g</code> can be any polynomial functions of any degree. </p>

<p><strong>Edit: C# code are welcomed as well.</strong> </p>
","Find the Discrete Pair of {x,y} that Satisfy Inequality Constriants","<c#><matlab><mathematical-optimization><linear-programming><nonlinear-optimization>","2010-09-25 10:56:28","954","3794077","1","<p>This is surely not possible to do in general for a general set of polynomial inequalities, by any method other than enumerative search, even if there are a finite number of solutions. (Perhaps I should say not trivial, as it is possible. Enumerative search will work, subject to floating point issues.) Note that the domain of interest need not be simply connected for higher order inequalities.</p>

<p>Edit: The OP has asked about how one might proceed to do a search.</p>

<p>Consider the problem</p>

<pre><code>x^3 + y^3 &gt;= 1e12
x^4 + y^4 &lt;= 1e16

x &gt;= 0, y &gt;= 0
</code></pre>

<p>Solve for all integer solutions of this system. Note that integer programming in ANY form will not suffice here, since ALL integer solutions are requested.</p>

<p>Use of meshgrid here would force us to look at points in the domain (0:10000)X(0:10000). So it would force us to sample a set of 1e8 points, testing every point to see if they satisfy the constraints.</p>

<p>A simple loop can potentially be more efficient than that, although it will still require some effort.</p>

<pre><code>% Note that I will store these in a cell array,
% since I cannot preallocate the results.
tic
xmax = 10000;
xy = cell(1,xmax);
for x = 0:xmax
  % solve for y, given x. This requires us to
  % solve for those values of y such that
  %   y^3 &gt;= 1e12 - x.^3
  %   y^4 &lt;= 1e16 - x.^4
  % These are simple expressions to solve for.
  y = ceil((1e12 - x.^3).^(1/3)):floor((1e16 - x.^4).^0.25);
  n = numel(y);
  if n &gt; 0
    xy{x+1} = [repmat(x,1,n);y];
  end
end
% flatten the cell array
xy = cell2mat(xy);
toc
</code></pre>

<p>The time required was...</p>

<pre><code>Elapsed time is 0.600419 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>Of the 100020001 combinations that we might have tested for, how many solutions did we find?</p>

<pre><code>size(xy)
ans =
           2     4371264
</code></pre>

<p>Admittedly, the exhaustive search is simpler to write.</p>

<pre><code>tic
[x,y] = meshgrid(0:10000);
k = (x.^3 + y.^3 &gt;= 1e12) &amp; (x.^4 + y.^4 &lt;= 1e16);
xy = [x(k),y(k)];
toc

<p>I ran this on a 64 bit machine, with 8 gig of ram. But even so the test itself was a CPU hog.</p>

<pre><code>Elapsed time is 50.182385 seconds.
</code></pre>

<p>Note that floating point considerations will sometimes cause a different number of points to be found, depending on how the computations are done.</p>

<p>Finally, if your constraint equations are more complex, you might need to use roots in the expression for the bounds on y, to help identify where the constraints are satisfied. The nice thing here is it still works for more complicated polynomial bounds.</p>

"3794406","<p>i'm pretty confused over the following issue and would be grateful for some clarity.</p>

<p>generally, how i work involves designing all of my graphics in Flash Authoring, converting them to Sprite symbols by changing the base class to flash.display.Sprite, give my instances names and finally export them to ActionScript.</p>

<p>the approach actually permits me to dynamically create properties in code on my Sprite instances that i've exported to ActionScript, just as if they were instances of MovieClips.  i'm not entirely sure why i'm able to do this, but i can.  in polling the objects to make sure of their superclass, they are indeed Sprites and not MovieClips.</p>

<p>however, as expected, if i program a new sprite from scratch in code and try to dynamically add a property to the new programmed sprite a compile time error will result.</p>

<pre><code>package
{
import flash.display.Sprite;
import flash.utils.getQualifiedSuperclassName;

public class Document extends Sprite
    {
    public function Document()
        {
        trace(getQualifiedSuperclassName(blueOvalInstance));
        //flash.display::Sprite (it's not a MovieClip)

        trace(blueOvalInstance.hasOwnProperty(""currentFrame""));
        //false (ok, ok, it's definately not a MovieClip)

        blueOvalInstance.myNewProperty = true;
        //dynamically added boolean property on a Sprite instance

        trace(blueOvalInstance.hasOwnProperty(""myNewProperty""));
        //true.  fancy that!  my Flash Authoring exported Sprite has a dynamically added property

        codeSprite();
        }

    private function codeSprite():void
        {
        var myCodedSprite:Sprite = new Sprite();

        myCodedSprite.graphics.beginFill(0xFF0000);
        myCodedSprite.graphics.drawRect(0, 0, 100, 100);
        myCodedSprite.graphics.endFill();

        addChild(myCodedSprite);

        myCodedSprite.anotherNewProperty = true;
        //dynamically added boolean property on a Sprite instance, just like before!

        //Compile Time Error!!!

        //1119: Access of possibly undefined property anotherNewProperty through a reference with static type flash.display:Sprite.
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>so why is it that can i dynamically add properties to exported sprites in my document class if they are not MovieClips, while i can not if i create them myself in code?</p>

<p>the following image shows a new BlueOval symbol being exported to ActionScript from Flash Authoring with the base class of Sprite (not MovieClip).  notice the new green (instead of blue) colored ""Movie Clip"" icon in the library panel.</p>

<li>Open project.pbxproj (in your filename.xcodeproj package) in a text

<p>I downloaded the sandbox of Symfony 1.4.8 and copied the files to my webserver. Unfortunately, when I try to access <code>/symfony/sf_sandbox/web/</code> (where I installed it), I get the following:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/lErEl.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>It seems like the images aren't showing. According to the text:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you see no image in this page, you may need to configure your web server so that it gains access to the <code>symfony_data/web/sf/</code> directory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, when I try to locate the folder referenced above, it does not exist:</p>

      images/
      js/

      index.php

</pre>

<p>As you can see, there is no <code>sf/</code> directory under <code>web/</code>. What am I doing wrong?</p>

","How to programmatically provide site structure and url path to Google search","<html><seo>","2010-09-26 06:16:36","1016","3828456","2","<p>When the search engines try to determine which content they should use for the snippet showed in the search results, they take a look at two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Meta description tag</li>
<li>Content on the page</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the goal of the search engines is to show a snippet that is as informative and useful for the searchers as possible, the  search engines will first evaluate the meta description tag trying to determine how relevant this description is to the keywords (search terms) used by the searcher in his query. A very straightforward indication of relevance is the presence of any of those keywords in the meta description tag. If the meta description is not present or it is determined to be irrelevant to the query performed, the search engines will try to pull content from the page and use it as the snippet for the search results. This behavior is true for several search engines such as Bing (and by extension for Yahoo!, whose search results are powered by Bing), Ask.com, etc.</p>
<p>Ok, let's now take a look at Google's search results for the query &quot;stack overflow&quot;:</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<h3><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a></h3>
<p>A language-independent collaboratively edited question and answer site for programmers.<br />
stackoverflow.com</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>As we can see, the snippet includes the following text: &quot;A language-independent collaboratively edited question and answer site for programmers.&quot; Surprisingly enough, this line of text doesn't appear in neither the meta description (which is actually missing from the page), nor in the content of Stack Overflow's homepage. Where did that line of text come from then?</p>
<p>Here's the answer: Google and AOL evaluate a third source of information to determine the search result snippet of a page: the <a href=""http://www.dmoz.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">DMOZ directory</a>. DMOZ is an open content directory, which includes links to millions of websites, organized by category. Let's do a search for Stack Overflow on DMOZ:</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a> - A language-independent collaboratively edited question and answer site for programmers.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>As we can see, Stack Overflow is listed on DMOZ and its description its being used by Google and AOL to populate the snippet.</p>
<p>If we try the same search for Yahoo! (or Bing), this is what we obtain:</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<h3><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/"">Stack Overflow</a></h3>
<p>Stack Overflow. Questions; Tags; Users; Badges; Unanswered. Ask Question. Top Questions active 171 featured hot week month</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Because the meta description tag is missing from Stack Overflow's homepage, and because Yahoo! doesn't use the DMOZ directory as an extra source of information, the only thing that Yahoo! has left is to pull content from the page, with poor results.</p>
<p>Instead of blaming Yahoo!, however, it is Stack Overflow's fault not to have included a meta description tag on their homepage, which would allow them to have more control over what gets displayed in the search results. Remember that the snippet has a strong influence in the Click Through Rate (CTR), which is the percentage of searchers that clicked on Stack Overflow's link from the search results page. Common sense says that it's more likely for someone to click on a descriptive snippet than to click on a snippet that reads &quot;Stack Overflow. Questions; Tags; Users; Badges; Unanswered. Ask Question. Top Questions active 171 featured hot week month&quot;.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the sitelinks, and as David Dorward mentioned, those links are automatically generated by Google and the only control that the webmaster has over them is to decide whether he wants to block them or not. There are a few factors that Google considers when determining if your website deserves to receive sitelinks: link structure/site architecture of your site, number of inbound links to your landing pages, anchor text of those links, traffic coming from Google's search results directly to your landing pages, etc.</p>

<p>Though this program did not run out of memory, any more memory requirements would lead to the <code>malloc</code> failing and then a segmentation fault due to the <code>ar[i][123] = 456;</code> line.</p>

<p>I want to put a limit on the memory allocation through my program, but also do not want to bind my program statically.</p>

<p>So, if my program is run on a machine with 8GB of memory, it can use a max of 4GB, but in case the program runs on a machine with 256MB, only 128MB should be available to the program.</p>

","Is there a way to shorten this code? C# winforms","<c#>","2010-09-27 00:21:45","820","3800445","4","<p><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms379564%28VS.80%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">A generic function</a> is a function that will work with a set of types that will be defined by the caller</p>

<p>so instead of 
<code>int doubleIt(int a) { return a*2; }</code> 
you can say<br>
<code>T doubleIt&lt;T&gt;(T a){ return a*2; }</code></p>

<p>this means you can define one function that can be called like this:</p>

<pre><code>int intResult = doubleIt(...pass in a int..);
double doubleResult = doubleIt(...pass in a double..);
float floatResult = doubleIt(...pass in a float..);
</code></pre>

<p>So for your code you create a method that takes the form type you're creating as a value for T.</p>

<p><strong>However the compiler doesn't know that T is a form and that you can call new on it, so you must contrain the types that can be passed as T with the where clause saying T must be a form and must a constructor that you can access</strong></p>

<p>You therefore replace the core functionality with a generic function that is specialised to the type of f1 that you need.</p>

<p>so instead of <code>Form f1 = null;</code> you have a generic type that you pass in <code>T f1 = null;</code></p>

<pre><code>private void ClickEvent&lt;T&gt;(object sender, EventArgs e) where T: Form, new() {
            T f1 = null;
    .
    .
    .
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Then call this method from the real event handlers</p>

<pre><code>private void form1ToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)       {
            ClickEvent&lt;Form1&gt;(sender, e)
        }

        private void form2ToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {
           ClickEvent&lt;Form1&gt;(sender, e) 
        }
</code></pre>

<p>So you end up with something like:</p>

<pre><code>public static Form IsFormAlreadyOpen(Type FormType)
{
    foreach (Form OpenForm in Application.OpenForms)
    {
        if (OpenForm.GetType() == FormType)
            return OpenForm;
    }
    return null;
}

private void ClickEvent&lt;T&gt;(object sender, EventArgs e) where T: Form, new() 
    {
    T f1 = null;
    if (IsFormAlreadyOpen(typeof(T)) == null)
    {
        f1 = new T();
        f1.MdiParent = this;
        f1.Show();
    }
    else
    {
        Form selectedForm = IsFormAlreadyOpen(typeof(T));
        foreach (Form OpenForm in this.MdiChildren)
        {
            if (OpenForm == selectedForm)
            {
                if (selectedForm.WindowState == FormWindowState.Minimized)

                    selectedForm.WindowState = FormWindowState.Normal;
                }
                selectedForm.Select();
            }
        }
    }
}

    private void form1ToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)       {
        ClickEvent&lt;Form1&gt;(sender, e)
    }

private void form2ToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) {
   ClickEvent&lt;Form1&gt;(sender, e) 
}

I was thinking that perhaps I can calculate the mean cumulativly, using something like:

<p>where x_bar(t) is the new mean and x_bar(t-1) is the old mean.</p>

<pre><code>def updateCentroid(self, label):
    cluster = self.clusters[label]

    cluster.centroid.x *= (n-1) / n

"3806512","<p>For example you measure the data coming from some device, it can be a mass of the object moving on the bridge. Because it is moving the mass will give data which will vibrate in some amplitude depending on the mass of the object. Bigger the mass - bigger the vibrations.
Are there any methods for filtering such kind of noise from that data?
May be using some formulas of vibrations? Have no idea what kind of formulas or algorithms (filters) can be used here. Please suggest anything.

time, but the amplitude chanbges periodically. Something like that I have when there are no objects on the moving road. (conveyer belt). vibrating near zero value.
When the object moves, I there are the same waves with changing amplitude. 
The graph can tell that there may be some force applying to the system and which produces forced occilations. So I am interested in removing such kind of noise.

<p>Based on your response to several comments, and based in my previous experience with weighting devices:</p>

<ol>
<li>You are interfacing the physical world, not just getting input from a mouse and keyboard. It is very important for you understand the device, how it works and how it is designed.</li>
<li>You need a calibration procedure. You have to use several master weights to be sure that the device is working properly and linearly in the whole scale, and that the static case is measured much better than your dynamic needs.</li>
<li>You'll not be able to predict if you can measure with several loads in the conveyor until you do some experiments and look very carefully at the resulting plots</li>
<li>You need to be sure that a load placed anywhere in the conveyor shows the same reading. Or at least you should be able to correlate reading and position.</li>

"3808531","<p>As PHP is simpler for me I wished to benchmark algorithms in it for fun, and I chose to do factorials.</p>

After doing the benchmarks, which implementation of factorial would you use in PHP? (assuming that you couldn't use the builtin one for some reason.)</p>

<p>It <em>is</em> fairly pointless to benchmark in a language that has significantly different features than the one that you want to implement the algorithm in though. Here, the relative cost of function calls and <code>if</code> statements in PHP is skewing the results significantly (or this is my best guess anyways). If you are careful to understand why this is happening and avoid it, it can still be fruitful though: differences will be more exaggerated as you noticed. It comes down to if it's easier to write it in the target language or work around the differences.</p>

<p>A simple calculation of complexity of the algorithm should be enough to decide  which one to use, or at least narrow down the selections.</p>

<p>As Mike Axiak points out in the comments, you are not even testing different algorithms here, you are testing two different implementations of the same algorithm: keep a running product over <code>i</code> from <code>n</code> to <code>1</code>.

"3808663","<p>I have a recursively defined user control that needs the following properties:</p>

<p>there are two columns</p>

<p>the second column contains a stack of these same type of controls (the recursive part)</p>

<p>if the box in the first column is shorter than the total height of the stacked boxes in the second column, the box should expand to make both columns the same height.</p>

<p>If the total height of the second column is shorter than the box in the first column, then the last item in the second column's stack should expand so they are the same height.</p>

<p>so for example, it might look like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/FPZwu.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Ok, so far what I have done is create a horizontal stack panel where the first item is a dock-panel containing a border and text... the second column is a vertical stack panel bound to a sublist, creating the recursive user control... like this..</p>

            &lt;/ItemsControl&gt;
        &lt;/StackPanel&gt;

<p>Where the requirement looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>    &lt;DockPanel&gt;
        &lt;Border MinHeight=""50""
                BorderBrush=""Black"" BorderThickness=""2""&gt;
            &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding Description}""

<p>Now this works great if the stacked column is taller, but it doesn't work if the first column is taller, and I get gaps.  Any idea how to handle this mutual height dependency?</p>

<hr>

<p>Update:
So by adding a border around the right columns stack panel, I was able to see that the stackpanel actually did receive the min-height changes.  However, even though there was room to expand, the children of the stack panel didn't automatically update.  If I fix the minheight of the stack panel before hand to something large, the children fill up.  What I need to figure out is how to update the chidren's height based on changes to the stack panel's min-height.</p>

I put it in a <code>DockPanel</code> so that you can see how it resizes.  Try typing stuff into the text boxes and watch how it behaves:</p>

  &lt;/DockPanel&gt;
&lt;/Page&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>All three rows of the <code>Grid</code> will have the height of a <code>TextBox</code> at a minimum (when you replace the TextBoxes with other elements, you'll need to set minimum heights to keep them from vanishing if they're empty).  Since the third row is star-sized, it will size itself to all remaining vertical space left after the first two rows are arranged.  So if there's a bunch of content in the first column, the third row in the second column gets taller.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Actually, there's no reason to even screw around with a <code>Grid</code> in this case:  What you're describing is really the behavior of the <code>DockPanel</code>:</p>

","How to display an array of UILabels?","<iphone><uilabel><border>","2010-09-28 00:02:31","806","3809136","1","<p>Here's a possible quick and easy way to do this. It's based on the code that you can get <a href=""http://www.cimgf.com/2010/01/28/fun-with-uibuttons-and-core-animation-layers/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""here"">here</a>.</p>

<p>Note that you have to add the QuartzCore framework to your project and include  in the file where you write this code!</p>

<p>Every UIView is backed by a CALayer. You can get at the UIView's CALayer with the .layer property. Since a UILabel is a UIView, you can get its backing layer this way. Once you have the backing layer, you can set its backgroundColor, cornerRadius, borderColor, and borderWidth properties. That should let you create the rounded effect.</p>

<p>To get the centered effect, try setting the UILabel's textAlignment to UITextAlignmentCenter. Then, you could try setting the UILabel's frame based on sizeThatFits, or maybe based on calling sizeWithFont on the string you're putting into the label.</p>

<p>Here's some quick, totally untested code to get you started.</p>

<p>Assume that somewhere you've initialized a UIFont as follows (put in whatever size you want for the font).</p>

<pre><code>labelFont = [UIFont systemFontOfSize:14];
</code></pre>

<p>Then, for each label, set it up as follows.I'm assuming you've pulled the text out of an array and put into a variable called ""text"". X_PADDING and Y_PADDING are how much spacing you want around the label's text. xLoc and yLoc are variables you're using to keep track of the x and y position you want to put the labels at. You'll probably increase xLoc based on textSize + X_PADDING + LABEL_SPACING or something (where you define LABEL_SPACING):</p>

<pre><code> CGSize textSize = [text sizeWithFont:labelFont];
 CGRect frame = CGRectMake( xLoc, yLoc,
                            textSize.width + X_PADDING,
                            textSize.height + Y_PADDING);
 UILabel *label = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:frame];
 label.text = text;
 label.textAlignment = UITextAlignmentCenter;

 CALayer *layer = label.layer;
 layer.masksToBounds = YES;
 layer.cornerRadius = 7.0; // or whatever works for you
 layer.borderWidth = 1.0;
 layer.borderColor = [[UIColor redColor].CGColor;
 layer.backgroundColor = [UIColor blueColor].CGColor;

 // Add the layer into its superview
 [yourSuperview addSubview:label];

"3809103","<p>I have tried again to ask the same <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3808708/delete-parts-of-a-dynamic-array-and-grow-other"">question</a>, but I ended up asking a different question by not providing essential information about my problem.</p>

<p>I implement a data structure which is a tree. Each node of this tree has an array/vector/(random access structure) with all its children which can be arbitrary many. The insertion/removal of elements is easy since we always double/divide-by-two the number of the elements in this array.</p>

<p>That is what the <code>O(k)</code> insertion/removal means in this context. We have <code>k</code> elements and we append <code>k</code> more or delete <code>k/2</code>. Rebuilding the whole data structure is fine so far. A <code>dynamic array</code> (or a <code>vector</code>) works.</p>

<p>The operation that raises the question is the following. Sometimes we have to <code>""split""</code> a node having <code>n</code> children, which means we ""divide"" the children among different nodes. The way we dive is in continuous groups. The most efficient way for this split is, I guess, to have one pointer for each new node at the position where its children are and how many there are (let's say each node takes <code>k</code> children). But then, the number of these children may change and that should not affect its siblings (or even worse, the whole tree) i.e the execution time of an insertion should be <code>O(k)</code> and not <code>O(n)</code>. How do we do it?</p>

<p>An easy but inefficient work-around would be that every time we split a node, we replace the ""big"" array of <code>children</code> with many (as many as the split parts) ""small"" dynamic arrays.</p>

<p>Each of the following ""boxes"" is a random access structure.</p>

Especially if you're already tracking pointers between nodes.</p>

<p>If I understand your statement, each node in your tree would contain a vector of children node pointers. When you need to split the node, you could create new nodes with each one receiving a segment of the vector of children pointers, and the newly created nodes would be inserted into the node vector of the parent node.</p>

<p>for example:</p>

<p><code>N1-&gt;N2-&gt;(n3,n4,n5,n6,n7,n8)</code> split N2 into two nodes: <code>N1-&gt;(N2_1, N2_2)</code> with <code>N2_1-&gt;(n3,n4,n5)</code> and <code>N2_2-&gt;(n6,n7,n8)</code></p>

<p>(Sorry, I don't know how to easily draw trees...)</p>

<p>This way, you are only relinking memory rather than copying, and access will generally be log n. Furthermore, this gives a proper representation of the tree structure in code.</p>

<p><strong>edit adding example:</strong></p>

<p>Suppose again, we have <code>N1-&gt;N2-&gt;(n3,n4,n5,n6,n7,n8)</code>. If N1 should need to have new nodes added, the only affect is on the N1 node: <code>N1-&gt;(N2,N9)-&gt;(n3,n4,n5,n6,n7,n8)</code></p>

<p>The structure of a node might be like this (very simplified):</p>

<pre><code>class Node {
  vector&lt;Node *&gt; children;
  Node * parent;
};
</code></pre>

<p>The larger tree structure would be many of these nodes all linked together much like a binary tree. To add nodes to any one node on a tree would only add items to the <code>children</code> member of that node. Nothing else is affected.</p>

<li><p>Even if they don't change the views, they may change how they look, leaving your stuff looking very odd in its new context.</p></li>

<p>If you roll your own, there's still the chance your ""action sheet"" will look different from all of the other ones on the system, but at least it'll look exactly how you intended it to look.</p>

<p>If you want to get a similar behavior in which you swipe over the cell to reveal that view, you could use the new iOS4 <code>UIGestureRecognizer</code> to look for a swipe over the cell. Once it detects a swipe you can use a view animation to slide the new view in.</p>

<p>Where <code>a</code> is the angle (in radians - I think ie 180 degress=π radians) and <code>r</code> is the radius.</p>

<p>To draw the little lines around the outside you would need to use this formula with say a radius of 100 and the also with a radius of 105 and draw between the two sets of co-ordinates.</p>

<p>To be able to help you with the dotted column names you should post the JSON data and not the screenshort with ""Object"" text on the place of the most important information.

<p>One more small remark. Beause you use <code>label</code> option for all columns you can remove <code>colNames</code> array which will be not used. The option <code>editable: false</code> is default, so you can remove it also. The parameter <code>mtype</code> you can also remove because it will not used for local data.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED</strong>: Sorry the value of the first parameter of <code>addRowData</code> should be do the name of the column with the data like you as do. So I deleted the first paragraph from the first version of my answer.</p>

{
    Page.Culture = ""en-US"";
    Page.UICulture = ""en-US"";

<p>I've noticed that when I use TRibbon control that comes with Delphi 2010, it works flawlessly on my Windows 7 system. However, the application has some weird painting issues on a Windows XP system with the ""classic theme"" (I haven't tried the playschool theme).</p>

<p>I know there are other Ribbon components available from <a href=""http://www.devexpress.com/Products/VCL/Exbars/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DevExpress</a> and <a href=""http://www.tmssoftware.com/site/advtoolbar.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TMS Software</a>, however purchasing a 3rd party control is not an option for this project.</p>

<p>Has anyone had this issue, or know of a solution?</p>
","Why does the Delphi 2010 TRibbon control ""flicker"" on Windows XP, but not Vista/7?","<delphi><delphi-2010><ribbon>","2010-09-28 14:08:18","796","7972409","2","<p>Most likely because Windows 7 uses ""Desktop Compositing"", which essentially means that a component is drawn to an off-screen bitmap and then copied onto the display. In XP, a component typically draws directly onto the display (which can cause flicker if the component first erases what's there and draws over the ""clean slate"").</p>

<p>Delphi supports double-buffering, which accomplishes the same thing. If you set the ribbon's DoubleBuffered property to True (in code, since it's not published) then that should avoid the flicker (at the cost of extra memory allocated and moved around when drawing)--I should say, however, that I haven't actually tried it with TRibbon.</p>

<p>Note that there is no additional overhead when running on Windows 7 (or Vista, for that matter) if you set DoubleBuffered to True. The VCL has code the skips the off-screen bitmap business when running on a version of Windows that does desktop compositing.</p>

"3815676","<p>On upload of images, the code creates several different thumbnails. In some cases, the thumbnail may be larger than the original image, in which case a padding is applied. In the case of JPEGs, the padding is white, and all is well. In the case of GIFs and PNGs, the padding should be transparent. And it is. Or not. Which is weird.</p>

<p><strong>Revision/Edit to add:</strong></p>

<p>Well, I've solved the main problem: padding added to PNG or GIF images is now transparent, instead of black. The smaller problem, that GIF transparency becomes black, is still with us, but I don't use GIF transparency much.</p>

"3816566","<p><strong>Update:</strong> Solved. See fix at bottom.</p>

<p>In my iPad app which supports all orientations, if the app is loaded in landscape, weird things happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>Alert views appear in portrait, even though the rest is in landscape</li>
<li>Rotating the iPad from landscape to portrait does not trigger a rotation (nor does it trigger any of the shouldAutorotate style methods).</li>
<li>Rotating the iPad 180 degrees (to ""other landscape"") does trigger rotation, and after this, the iPad behaves like normal (i.e. rotates correctly to portrait and landscape when rotated). </li>
</ol>

<p>Alert view screen below. Weird, weird. Any ideas why this might be happening? It only happens when loading in landscape -- loading in portrait and then rotating to landscape works just fine.
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ThbU5.jpg"" alt=""Landtrait!""></p>

<p><strong>Solution:</strong> This problem occurred because I was adding a UIViewController (modally) on top of the main view controller as soon as the app finished loading (more specifically, in the app's <code>viewDidAppear:</code> method). </p>

<p>iOS sends a number of (4) <code>shouldAutorotateToInterfaceOrientation:</code> calls to the current/main view controller after things have started up, to figure out which orientations are currently supported. When I added the other VC so soon, this occurred in the middle of the aforementioned calls. Thus, I only got one or two calls (for ""portrait"", because it starts with portrait). </p>

<p>The main view controller was then left with a default support of ""NO"" for the landscape orientations, but the newly added view controller (which is also asked about orientations) now happily responds yes.</p>

<p>If I had removed the other VC (which is in landscape), I would have realized that my main view controller was stuck in portrait. So I had a portrait view, on top of which there was a landscape view. The alerts and such heeded the orientation of the former, hence the disastrous results above.</p>

<p>Additionally, if I tried to rotate to portrait, I couldn't, because the main view controller was already in portrait. Rotating to landscape was also impossible because the other view controller is already in landscape. Only when I did the ""landscape but that other one"" rotation, did both view controllers agree that rotation was required, and thus the device rotated.</p>

<p>The fix in my case was to simply put the creation of the other controller at a slight delay. using <code>performSelector:withObject:afterDelay.</code> -- 0 seemed to work but I just put it at 1 to be sure. It looks a bit weird, with the main vc appearing and then the other vc, but it's better than the above.</p>

<p>The issue with the extra column on the right seems to be to do with automatically setting column widths.  The DataGrid is actually setup (see XAML below) such that there is a GridSplitter just on it's right.  When I move the GridSplitter I note that the DataGrid columns don't resize automatically.  So overall the issue is both (a) on startup there is a partial extra column visible, and (b) after moving the GridSplitter they don't resize either.</p>

     if (jsonDate == undefined) {
         return """";
     }
     var utcTime = parseInt(jsonDate.substr(6));

     var date = new Date(utcTime);
     var minutesOffset = date.getTimezoneOffset();

     return date.addMinutes(minutesOffset).toString(""M/d/yyyy h:mm tt"");
 }
</code></pre>

<p>So you are correct that .NET assumes, but it's UTC instead of GMT (though <a href=""http://geography.about.com/od/timeandtimezones/a/gmtutc.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">they are similar</a>).

<p>As far as converting dates from UTC to a specific time zone, on the server you could use the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.timezoneinfo.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>TimeZoneInfo</code></a> class which has a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.timezoneinfo.converttimefromutc.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>ConvertTimeFromUtc</code></a> method. Or you could write a custom converter that inherits from the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.script.serialization.javascriptconverter.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>JavaScriptConverter</code></a> class. In javascript, there are the <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_utc.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>UTC</code></a> and <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_getTimezoneOffset.asp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>getTimezoneOffset</code></a> methods that could be used.</p>

<p>Hope this helps and good luck.</p>

"3819778","<p>I'm not in a position to make out the difference between <code>vld4_f32</code> and <code>vld4q_f32</code> in ARM NEON instructions.</p>

<p>The confusion started when I raised my coding levels and started looking at the assembly instructions rather than the less informative intrinsics.</p>

<p>The reason I need to use <strong>vld4</strong> variant instruction here is because, I would like to capture <strong>4</strong> <code>float32_t</code>'s from every <strong>4th position</strong> of my large array.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/k2wKu.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The <code>vld4_f32</code> intrinsics and the corresponding assembly instructions look like this (<a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/ARM-NEON-Intrinsics.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">From this link</a>)</p>

<pre><code>float32x2x4_t vld4_f32 (const float32_t *) 
Form of expected instruction(s): vld4.32 {d0, d1, d2, d3}, [r0]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>vld4q_f32</code> intrinsics and its corresponding assembly instructions looks like this</p>

<pre><code>float32x4x4_t vld4q_f32 (const float32_t *) 
Form of expected instruction(s): vld4.32 {d0, d1, d2, d3}, [r0]
</code></pre>

<p>Well, at the intrinsics level <strong>the difference I see is the return type</strong>, but if I look at the assembly instruction and the number of registers, they both look like the same. How will the compiler or the assembler know the difference between the two?</p>

<p>Can somebody clarify more on this and also explain how I can achieve loading <strong>4 float32_t</strong> values which are positioned <strong>at every 4th memory location</strong> into a single register?</p>

I used CodeSourcery to see the actual register contents for all the load instructions. The link I have posted doesn't give the complete details on the vld4q_f32.</p>

<p>Okay, first comes the <code>vld4_f32</code>, this loads <strong>4 d</strong> registers (e.g. d16-19) each <strong>d</strong> register is 64 bits long, so this instruction will load the first 8 values interleaved with an interval of 4 as shown in the figure below.
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/O0cOh.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>In the second case the <code>vld4q_f32</code>, this loads <strong>8 d</strong> registers (e.g. d16-23) instead of four. For a reader of this <a href=""http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/ARM-NEON-Intrinsics.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">link</a>, it is not at all clear that 8 registers will be loaded. When  I looked at the dis-assembled code for a <code>vld4qf32</code>, it was making use of 8 d registers.</p>

<p>This instruction will indeed do what I was hoping it to do i.e. to load 4 <code>float32_t</code> values which are at the interval of 4 as shown in the figure below.

"3819857","<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I have a web-application with more than 5 themes. Each themes covers a completely different style for different customers. whenever we publish a new version of our application we send it for all of customers.</p>

<p><strong>The problem.</strong></p>

<p>We specify theme in web.config file in <code>&lt;Page&gt;</code> tag. like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;page theme=""Theme1"" /&gt; // or Theme2 for second customer.
</code></pre>

<p>with this approach we easily change the style of application from each other without writing codes which needs a new publish for each one.</p>

<p>With changing the <code>theme=""Theme1""</code>. nothing change and we didn't write a code in application , so why changing <code>theme</code> don't change the theme and we need a new publish?</p>

<p>we want to change it in <code>web.config</code> or somewhere else and with changing it the theme change without needing a new publish for each one.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update :</strong></p>

<p>I Publish Once and then copy the published version for each customer (5 times) then in each <code>web.config</code> file I change the <code>theme=""CustomerTheme""</code>. but only the theme which was active in publish process is usable in all of 5 versions and other 4 themes are un-usable </p>

<p>--</p>

<p>Actually the main question is that why changes in Web.Config need a different publish while it is XML and do not need a complie. I should Add this note that, App_Theme include all of 5 themes so that all of them Compiles and are ready to use</p>

<p>--</p>

<p>This is the way I publish the application</p>

"3823489","<p>In Google's documentation it is said that an event can be tracked in the following way:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a onclick=""_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'category', 'action', 'opt_label', opt_value]);""&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;

<p>or older version:</p>

<p>I was looking with Firebug to the request that are made when a click on a link and I see there aborted request:</p>

<p><code>http://www.google-analytics.com/__utm.gif?utmwv=4.7.2&amp;utmn=907737223&amp;....</code>  </p>

<p>This happens because browser unload all javascript when user navigates to a new page. How in this case event tracking is performed?</p>

","How does google analytics track events when user navigates to other page inside one domain","<google-analytics>","2010-09-29 16:04:36","10237","3835492","4","<p>The problem is that there isn't enough time for the script to finish running before the user is taken to the next page.  What you can do is create a wrapper function for your GA code and in the onclick, call the wrapper function and after the GA code is triggered in your wrapper function, set a time out and update location.href with the link's url.  Example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href=""somepage.html"" onclick=""wrapper_function(this,'category', 'action', 'opt_label', 'opt_value');return false;""&gt;click me&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;
function wrapper_function(that,category,action,opt_label,opt_value) {
  _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', category, action, opt_label, opt_value]);
  window.setTimeout(""window.location.href='"" + that.href + ""'"", 1000);
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>code will vary a bit based on your link but hopefully you get the idea - basically it waits a little bit before taking the user to the target url to give the script some time to execute. </p>

<pre><code>#sign_in_table table tr td.sign_in_input { ... }

#sign_in_table table tr td.sign_in_input input { ... }

#sign_in_table table tr td.sign_submit input{ ... }
</code></pre>

<p>1. You can simplify this. These selectors are overcomplicated and slow down both the rendering of the page and reading the code (see <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Writing_Efficient_CSS"" rel=""nofollow"">Writing Efficient CSS</a>):</p>

<pre><code>.sign_in_input  { ... }
.sign_in_input input { ... }
.sign_submit input { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>The above will do the same as your code. Moreover, it doesn't depend on the HTML structure.</p>

<p>2. When looking at the properties, I notice that all the table cells have a different padding:</p>

<pre><code>.sign_in_input {padding:40px 0px 5px 10px;}

.sign_submit { /* No rules, just a default padding */ }
</code></pre>

<p>You should make sure the vertical padding is the same:</p>

<pre><code>.sign_submit { padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; }
</code></pre>

<p>3. The submit button has a defined height but the inputs do not. If the height is higher than the height of the inputs, it is necessary to vertically align it to middle:</p>

<pre><code>.sign_submit  { line-height: 34px;  /* = Height of the input */ vertical-align: middle; }
.sign_in_input input { height: 30px; /* Better specify the height of the input fields as well*/ /* ... */ }
</code></pre>

<p>4. Make sure that the submit button image does not have a white/transparent stripe on the top.</p>

<p>5. Make sure you set all vertical input margins to 0:</p>

<pre><code>.sign_submit input { margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; }
</code></pre>

<p>6. Try to move the hidden input field after the submit button. Should not change anything but who knows :)</p>

<p>7. If none of the above helps, you might also use a negative margin hack (but it's not really a nice solution):</p>

<pre><code>.sign_submit input { margin-top: -5px; }
</code></pre>

<p>8. You happen to have the rule for .sign_submit input duplicated. Remove one of them to avoid hard to track errors.</p>

<p>9. When looking at your PHP code, I notice you directly embed the $_GET contents to the page. This is considered dangerous and you should always sanitize this using htmlentities to avoid XSS.</p>

<p><b>EDIT:</b></p>

<p>After looking at the site, simply changing the vertical-align of .sign_submit to bottom fixes the problem in my Opera browser:</p>

<pre><code>.sign_submit  { vertical-align: bottom; /* Instead of middle */ }
</code></pre>

"3823864","<p>I have an TFS server installation that through time has gone through upgrades from TFS 2005 to TFS 2008 and then to TFS 2010.
During the lifetime of the installation a lot of projects have been created and different project templates have been used. MSF Agile 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 and 5.0. and a few MSF CMMI ones.</p>

<p>What I would like to do is ""replace"" the project template used for all these projects to use a new one common one: Microsoft Visual Studio Scrum 1.0.</p>

<p>I am aware that TFS project templates are used as <em>templates</em> for creating new projects and cannot modify the tfs projects definitions after creation.</p>

<p>Uptil now only the version control and build server part of TFS have been used and there are no existing work item types.</p>

<p>Additionally all projects and build scripts are depending on the source code paths stay the same.</p>

<p>As I see it I have the following options:</p>

<p><strong>Create new TFS projects using the correct project template and then move/branch the source code to the new project.</strong>  </p>

<ol>
<li>All code is moved to a temporary team project.  </li>
<li>The old project is deleted  </li>
<li>New project with the original name and correct process template is created  </li>
<li>Code is moved to the new team project  </li>
<li><p>Temporary team project is deleted</p>

<ul>
<li><p>All the build definitions needs to be to recreated which is not an option.</p></li>
<li><p>The source code move/branch will ""mess up"" the versioning history</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/SVezi.jpg"" alt=""alt text""><br>
By messing up the versioning history I mean that when you move source code it will behind the scenes do a delete + source rename on the original location and the history will still be located in the old project. This will make searching in the history difficult and if I actually delete the old project I will loose all the history before the source code move.</p>

<p>This is really not an option for me since there is years of code change history that is needed to for supporting the different applications being built.</p>

<p><strong>Use the TFS migration tools to migrate to another TFS project</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>This has the same downsides as the first solution</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Replace/import work item types, install new reports, create new SharePoint sites</strong></p>

<p>For each tfs project</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Delete existing work item definitions using ""witadmin deletewitd""</p></li>
<li><p>Import each work item definition from the new process template using ""witadmin importwitd""</p></li>
<li><p>Import work item categories using ""witadmin importcategories""</p></li>
<li><p>Delete old reports in project folder in report server</p></li>
<li><p>Upload the report definitions from the new process template</p></li>
<li><p>Modify data sources used for the reports using the report manager to point to the correct shared data sources (TfsReportDS and TfsOlapReportsDS)</p></li>
<li><p>Modify the report parameter ExplicitProject default value to """" (empty string) and disable prompt user option.</p></li>
<li><p>Export the documents in the old SharePoint site using stsadm</p></li>
<li><p>Delete the old SharePoint site</p></li>
<li><p>Recreate the sharepoint site using the TFS2010 Agile Dashboard site template</p></li>
<li><p>Activate site feature ""Team Foundation Server Scrum dashboard""</p></li>
<li><p>In TFS Project Settings -> Project Portal Settings: Enable ""team project portal"" and ensure the url is correct. Enable ""reports and dashboards refer to data for this team project""</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And finally..</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Process the Warehouse</p></li>
<li><p>Process the Analysis Database</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Even though that this involves a lot of small steps this looks more appealing because
this option will not force me to move the source code and my existing build definitions will be intact.</p>

<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>

<p>Are there other ways to achieve the replacement of work item types that I haven't mentioned?</p>

<p>And/or am I missing any steps in last solution?</p>

"3824113","<p>I am playing around with a small MFC-wizard-generated application, in Visual C++ 2010, and I just decided to put my own bitmap into the resources to replace the three-cubes MFC bitmap that shows up in the ribbon UI Application Button, aka the ""marble"".</p>

<p>The original appeared to use black (0,0,0) as a transparency color, but I am unable to determine what the MFC Ribbon (mfc-feature-pack stuff) stuff in Visual Studio 2010 does to determine transparency on a bitmap used as the ribbon's main icon.</p>

<p>The properties of the ribbon (IDR_RIBBON) show Image=IDB_MAIN, and IDB_MAIN is a 32x32 bitmap in BMP format, loaded from a disk file called main.bmp.</p>

<p>Some of the bitmap resources in this project have what looks like what I would expect: A magenta color which becomes transparent, but the MFC main bitmap did not use this color scheme or palette.</p>

<p>Here is an example of the actual results, which are I hope show that the results are not what I wanted:

I'm using this to create a file browsers, with different actions based on wether the item selected is a file or a folder. </p>

<p>Basically, You need to create a custom adapter extending ArrayAdapter (you can use another base class if all your items inherit from the same class). Here's a sample code :</p>

<pre><code>public class MyCustomAdapter extends ArrayAdapter&lt;Object&gt; {


    public MyCustomAdapter(Context context, int textViewResourceId,
            ArrayList&lt;Object&gt; objects) {
        super(context, textViewResourceId, objects);
        mList = objects;
    }


    public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {
        Object obj = mList.get(position);
        View v = convertView;
        LayoutInflater vi = (LayoutInflater) mContext
                .getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);


        if (obj.getClass().isAssignableFrom(MyClass1.class)){
            v = vi.inflate(R.layout.myclass1_item_layout, null);
            setupViewClass1(obj,v);
        } else if (obj.getClass().isAssignableFrom(MyClass2.class)){
            v = vi.inflate(R.layout.myclass2_item_layout, null);
            setupViewClass2(obj,v);
        }

        return v;
    }

    private void setupViewClass1 (Object obj, View v){  
        // setup the content of your view (labels, images, ...)
    }

    private void setupViewClass2 (Object obj, View v){  
        // setup the content of your view (labels, images, ...)
    }

    private ArrayList&lt;Object&gt; mList;

<p>Then you need to add an OnItemClickListener as well as an OnCreateContextMenuListener to handle the click and longpress event on your list, again making a filter on the class of your object. </p>

"3826762","<p>I would like to collect your ideas on the following:</p>

<p>SharePoint 2010 (and 2007) does have a preview button... while you are editing a publishing page you can switch to the ""Page"" tab and hit the Preview button:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/556nd.png"" alt=""The ribbon in SharePoint 2010 when editing a publishing page"">
Clicking this button does some magic to save your data, and opens a new window where the preview page is displayed. Nice, but could be better. What I would like is live update on editing of field controls from the edit page on the preview page.</p>

<p>My thoughts on this is are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Field types have an ID. For rendering the field values on your preview page, subclass from the standard FieldValue control, and render a span with the same ID around the field value html. So if we have the text ABC in the content editable div of a RichTextFiled X, render the field value as ABC in the display output (for example using EditModePanels for Display and Edit)</li>
<li>Add key-stroke event handler on all fields for the edit mode page (using for example jQuery), on key press copy contents from edit browser window to preview browser window</li>
<li>Transfer can be done using <a href=""http://www.sfpeter.com/2008/03/13/communication-between-browser-windows-with-jquery-my-new-plugin/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.sfpeter.com/2008/03/13/communication-between-browser-windows-with-jquery-my-new-plugin/</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does this sound doable? Would be great to work dual monitor, edit on one monitor, preview page in its real rendering on the other monitor. Especially if the edit mode differs from the display mode.</p>

<p>Looking forward to your input!</p>

"3826938","<p>For those times when a UISlider just isn't fun enough I was thinking I'd work up a custom UIControl to do something similar to a Google O Meter from the google chart API on iOS.</p>

"3827125","<p>When faced by an untrusted certificate, every single browser I know displays a blaring error like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/6RwXk.png""></p>

<p><strong>Why</strong> is that? </p>

<p>This strongly discourages web developers to use an awesome technology like SSL out of fears that users will find the website extremely shady. Ilegitimate (ie: phishing) sites do fine on HTTP, so that can't be a concern. </p>

<p>Why do they make it look like such a big deal? Isn't having SSL even if untrusted better than not having it at all?</p>

<hr>

<p>It looks like I am being misunderstood. I am taking issue with the fact that HTTP sites cannot be more secure than an HTTPS site, even if untrusted. HTTP doesn't do encryption or identification. Phishers can make their sites on HTTP and no warnings are shown. In good faith, I am at the very least encrypting traffic. How can that be a bad thing?</p>

<p>SSL provides for secure communication between client and server by allowing <strong>mutual authentication</strong>, the use of <strong>digital signatures</strong> for integrity, and <strong>encryption</strong> for privacy.</p>

<p>(<a href=""http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/ssl/ssl_intro.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">apache ssl docs</a>)</p>
<p>Yep, I don't see anything about third party certificate authorities that all browsers should recognize as &quot;legit.&quot; Of course, that's just the way the world is, so if you don't want people to see a scary page, you've got to get a cert signed by someone the browsers will recognize.</p>
<p><strong>or</strong></p>
<p>If you're just using SSL for a small group of individuals or for in-house stuff, you can have people install your root cert in their browser as a trusted cert. This would work fairly well on a lan, where a network admin could install it across the entire network.</p>
<p>It may sound awkward to suggest sending your cert to people to install, but if you think about it, what do you trust more: a cert that came with your browser because that authority paid their dues, or a cert sent to you personally by your server admin / account manager / inside contact?</p>
<hr />
<p>Just for shits and giggles I thought I'd include the text displayed by the &quot;Help me understand&quot; link in the screenshot in the OP...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you connect to a secure website, the server hosting that site presents your browser with something called a &quot;certificate&quot; to verify its identity. This certificate contains identity information, such as the address of the website, which is verified by a third party that your computer trusts. By checking that the address in the certificate matches the address of the website, it is possible to verify that you are securely communicating with the website you intended, and not a third party (such as an attacker on your network).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a domain mismatch (for example trying to go to a subdomain on a non-wildcard cert), this paragraph follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this case, the address listed in the certificate does not match the address of the website your browser tried to go to. One possible reason for this is that your communications are being intercepted by an attacker who is presenting a certificate for a different website, which would cause a mismatch. Another possible reason is that the server is set up to return the same certificate for multiple websites, including the one you are attempting to visit, even though that certificate is not valid for all of those websites. Chromium can say for sure that you reached , but cannot verify that that is the same site as <em>foo.admin.example.com</em> which you intended to reach. If you proceed, Chromium will not check for any further name mismatches. In general, it is best not to proceed past this point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the cert isn't signed by a trusted authority, these paragraphs follow instead:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this case, the certificate has not been verified by a third party that your computer trusts. Anyone can create a certificate claiming to be whatever website they choose, which is why it must be verified by a trusted third party. Without that verification, the identity information in the certificate is meaningless. It is therefore not possible to verify that you are communicating with <em>admin.example.com</em> instead of an attacker who generated his own certificate claiming to be <em>admin.example.com</em>. You should not proceed past this point.</p>
<p>If, however, you work in an organization that generates its own certificates, and you are trying to connect to an internal website of that organization using such a certificate, you may be able to solve this problem securely. You can import your organization's root certificate as a &quot;root certificate&quot;, and then certificates issued or verified by your organization will be trusted and you will not see this error next time you try to connect to an internal website. Contact your organization's help staff for assistance in adding a new root certificate to your computer.</p>

<p>Those last paragraphs make a pretty good answer to this question I think. ;)</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/WkHCC.png"" alt=""IE9 example""></p>

<p>We would like to change the style to a light grey background and a black text. Unfortunately, most browsers (including IE, which is what the customer is using) ignore the <code>color: ...</code> CSS attribute on disabled controls, so we cannot change the foreground color.</p>

<p>For text boxes (<code>input type=""text""</code>), this can easily be workarounded by using the <code>readonly</code> instead of the <code>disabled</code> attribute. Unfortunately, this is not an option for dropdowns (<code>select</code>) or checkboxes (<code>input type=""checkbox""</code>).</p>

<p>Is there an easy workaround for that? Preferebly one where the control does not need to be replaced by another type of control? (...since our controls are rendered by ASP.NET)</p>

<p>In older versions of IE, you can adjust the background color (but not the color).  Thus:</p>

"3831727","<p>I've been fiddling around with <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/chess/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CHESS</a>, which seems like an incredibly useful tool. However, ironically, I seem to be dealing with a Heisenbug in one of my test methods. The results reported by CHESS when I run this test are unpredictable:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes the test will pass</li>
<li>Sometimes the test will fail, with no further description (simply: ""Test failed"")</li>
<li>Sometimes the test will fail with instructions to duplicate*</li>
<li>Sometimes the test will indicate ""CHESS detected deadlock""</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, I thought this inconsistency must be due to the fact that the test involves the use of <code>Random</code> objects. It must have been that different seed values were yielding different outcomes, right?</p>

<p>So I updated the test to simply run for a predefined set of seed values (0 to 10). Thread-local <code>Random</code> objects get seeded by a (pseudo-)random value produced by a shared <code>Random</code> within a lock. The code looks <strike>basically</strike> <strong>exactly</strong> like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/hzk82.png"" alt=""Screenshot of CHESS reporting a deadlock""></p>

<p>(<strong>Update</strong>: I am running this on .NET 3.5, as CHESS only supports VS 2008. I wonder if the problem could have something to do with <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/03/06/locks-and-exceptions-do-not-mix.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>?)</p>

<p>As I understand it, the above code should actually be pretty deterministic. Since <code>sharedRandom</code> is initialized with a known seed (between 0 and 10), the values produced by the <code>localRandom</code> object belonging to each thread running the code inside the <code>Parallel.For</code> call should be consistent from one test run to the next (which thread gets which seed from <code>sharedRandom</code> may differ between runs, but among the 5 iterations within <code>Parallel.For</code>, the same 5 seeds should be used for <code>localRandom</code>).</p>

<p>That's how <em>I</em> understand it. But from the CHESS results, I'm inclined to believe I must be missing something.</p>

<ol>
<li>Is there a deadlock in the above code that I'm too dumb to see?</li>
<li>Should I not be using the <code>Random</code> class in concurrency-related tests?</li>
<li>For those who have experience using CHESS: is it a reliable tool? Does it sometimes give false positives? This is actually a big one, as if it turns out that this scenario is common (inconsistent test results), then perhaps it'd be advisable for me to hold off on using CHESS at all for the time being.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't have hands-on experience with CHESS but studied it well enough to know that you cannot rely on it to ever give you reproducible test results.  It's approach to uncovering threading problems is very much statistical, injecting random delays in the threads.  Designed to recreate the kind of threading problems that are so heavily influenced by timing, especially race conditions.</p>

<p>A race condition can go undetected for a very long time if code execution timing is predictable.  And when it strikes, incredibly hard to diagnose.  A good example of this is a large government project I heard of that shipped with the logging kept turned on.  Because with it turned off it would no longer work and there was no good way to diagnose the problem without the logging info.</p>

<p>Threat CHESS as a diagnostic tool.  If it raises a flag, you can be fairly sure that you have a real, but still hard to solve, threading problem.</p>

NSRect otherFrame = [otherView frame];

Personally, I'd recommend implementing your own Adapter (most likely in this case by extending SimpleCursorAdapter) and encapsulating the updates to distance text and compass heading rotation within that.</p>

<p>To help with resource management, you probably want to create a SensorListener and LocationListener within the Activity that will host the ListView. Whenever you receive an update call your self-rolled <code>updateCompassAndLocation</code> method from within your Adapter class. </p>

<p>From within that method you have two options. Either iterate over each of the items that make up the data collection being represented and modify the compass graphic and distance text, or simply record the current location and heading as variables within the class, and call <code>notifyDataSetChanged</code> to force the adapter to update the views itself within the <code>getView</code> method. In either case (especially the latter), you'll need to set the distance text and heading compass values within getView.</p>

public View getView(int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) {

<p>If you parametrize the line as lat = func(long) you will run into trouble with vertical lines (i.e. those going exactly north south) as the latitude varies while the longitude is fixed.</p>

<p>Therefore I'd rather use another parametrization:</p>

<pre><code>long(alpha) = long_1 + alpha * (long_2 - long_1)

lat(alpha)  = lat_1  + alpha * (lat_2  - lat_1)

<p>My main area of interest is the last case.</p>

<p>Here, the first statement got fully optimized and two calls of the second statement were inlined and they actually represent similiar chunks of code. </p>

<p>Each of them does <code>test something something</code> and then makes a short <code>jump</code> if the test wasn't successful (these jumps obviously point to the end of corresponding routine).</p>

<p>Does the compiler make an explicit check on every function call for if the function is called the first time?<br>
Does the compiler actually have a <code>flag</code>, which indicates if this is the first time the function was called or not?<br>
Where is it stored (I guess all that <code>test</code> stuff is about it, but I'm not exactly sure)?</p>

In both snippets it is testing the flag, if it is raised it will jump to the end of the function or else it will initialize the static variable. Note that since the compiler has inlined the function it could as well optimize away the second test, knowing that the flag is to be tested only on the first call.</p>

<p>The flag seems to be located at address 0x00403374, and takes a byte, while the variable itself is located at address 0x00403370.</p>

<p>Plan B: Have each of your seperate JVMs create a ServerSocket and send them a message through the socket they should shut down.</p>

<p>Plan C: Get ProcessView (http://www.teamcti.com/pview/prcview.htm), it can be run from the command line and kill processes by name (with wildcards), so you could kill all java processes in one go. Its a sledgehammer solution, but may suit your short term needs.</p>

""It just lets you open other apps"" Is exactly what it does, nothing else. Thats Windows 7 feature, not API Code Pack limitation. Key point to this is fact, that your application is not running, so WHERE it should execute your method?
Correct implementation would be to make your JumpList run your application with correct parameters and then inside your application Main method invoke different methods depending on those parameters.
Dont forget, even window applications have input parameters, just like console apps.</p>

<p>Here we go...
I am making a photo or image editor with the variation of letting the user to insert buttons in top of the edited image(this buttons when clicked plays an audio file) all of this works so far. 
BUT at the end when the user finish his work i need him to save it, so it can be send and view by others.<br>
Now I think I know how to save an edited image  but that dose not contain the buttons (controls) ....  its like when we save a file at power point and we send it to others they contain audio and the image. Hope fully you guys understand if so can any one point me in a direction to do this or show me how if possible.</p>

hopefully you guys can help me out with a simple example i really neeed some sample working code. Note: I am working on windows form app WFA C# 3.5 .net M.V.studio2010 (the file I gave above has a backup with a 2008 vercion) thanx in advance.</p>
","How to Save Controls that are inside a form","<c#><custom-controls><image-manipulation>","2010-10-01 04:40:40","279","3836603","5","<p>Similar to jim's answer, I would suggest having an archive of some sort (ZIP or otherwise) containing all the media necessary. </p>

<p>Store the images and sounds files by name or checksum in the archive and keep the meta-data (button positions, names, what media they use, etc, we'll call it the definition file) in a file also stored in the archive. You may be able to use XML to make that human-readable.</p>

<p>The entire package will then be simple to distribute and use, as everything will be contained in the archive. Your application simply needs to scan for archives, check each archive for a valid definition file, and load the ones that are needed.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Going from the screenshot you posted and my understanding of the problem, I'm going to suggest the following:</p>

<p>When a user creates a button (defined as a rectangular area or ""hotspot""), open a dialogue asking for a sound file to associate. Then, store the top-left and bottom-right corners of the button and the filename in a XML file, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Button name=""myButton!""&gt;
    &lt;Position top=""128"" left=""128"" /&gt;
    &lt;Size height=""200"" width=""200"" /&gt;
    &lt;Audio filename=""something.mp3"" /&gt;
&lt;/Button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when compiling a plugin, create a ZIP archive. Inside, place the XML file and all the audio files you need. </p>

<p>When loading a plugin, read the XML file first and find the audio file (assume all audio files are in the same archive as the XML file). Then create the button and add the audio filename as, say, its Tag property. Assign all buttons one generic OnClick event, and in the OnClick event, play the audio file given by the current object's Tag. </p>

<p>If you don't understand what I mean, I'll try to elaborate further. I think that method should work neatly and be pretty simple to work with. :)</p>

<p>There could be three ways to achieve a usable window in this case:</p>

<ol>
<li>Design the form components in a JPanel instead of JFrame.  Then add the newly designed JPanel in a new JFrame inside a JScrollPane</li>
<li>Use the space available on the right side of the window to arrange the controls and reduce the height of the JFrame</li>
<li>Use JTabbedPane to keep the components in separate tabs like General, Address, Contacts and shift the corresponding components in tabs</li>
<li>In option 2 and 3 the Submit button shall be kept on the JFrame in the bottom area so it remains visible all the time.</li>
</ol>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>After implementing the first point in my suggestions I created a JPanel through NetBeans IDE and named it ComponentsPanel.  Then I created a JFrame and added one JScrollPane and JButton to that frame.  I also added ComponentsPanel earlier created with all the text fields into the JScrollPane.  The result looks like as follows:</p>

The function needs to be continuous based on the transform and have a local minima (0) where the images are aligned perfectly.  This is called a cost function.</p>

<p>Then use any optimization algorithm over the function and inputs -- you are trying to optimize the transform (translation, scale, rotation).  Examples are hill climbing, genetic, simulated annealing, etc.</p>

<p>There are products that do this -- usually they are called Forms Recognition, Forms Registration, Forms Processing, etc. Some are SDKs, but there are also applications that can do it without programming.</p>

<pre><code>f(x) = A*x + b = y
</code></pre>

<p>For a segment, it is exactly the same, except that x is included on an interval I.</p>

<p>If you have two segments, defined as follow:</p>

<pre><code>Segment1 = {(X1, Y1), (X2, Y2)}
Segment2 = {(X3, Y3), (X4, Y4)}
</code></pre>

<p>The abcisse Xa of the potential point of intersection (Xa,Ya) must be contained in both interval I1 and I2, defined as follow :</p>

<pre><code>I1 = [min(X1,X2), max(X1,X2)]
I2 = [min(X3,X4), max(X3,X4)]
</code></pre>

<p>And we could say that Xa is included into :</p>

<pre><code>Ia = [max( min(X1,X2), min(X3,X4) ),
      min( max(X1,X2), max(X3,X4) )]
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we need to check that this interval Ia exists :</p>

<pre><code>if (max(X1,X2) &lt; min(X3,X4)):
    return False  # There is no mutual abcisses
</code></pre>

<p>So, we have two line formula, and a mutual interval. Your line formulas are:</p>

<pre><code>f1(x) = A1*x + b1 = y
f2(x) = A2*x + b2 = y
</code></pre>

<p>As we got two points by segment, we are able to determine A1, A2, b1 and b2:</p>

<pre><code>A1 = (Y1-Y2)/(X1-X2)  # Pay attention to not dividing by zero
A2 = (Y3-Y4)/(X3-X4)  # Pay attention to not dividing by zero
b1 = Y1-A1*X1 = Y2-A1*X2
b2 = Y3-A2*X3 = Y4-A2*X4
</code></pre>

<p>If the segments are parallel, then A1 == A2 :</p>

<pre><code>if (A1 == A2):
    return False  # Parallel segments
</code></pre>

<p>A point (Xa,Ya) standing on both line must verify both formulas f1 and f2:</p>

<pre><code>Ya = A1 * Xa + b1
Ya = A2 * Xa + b2
A1 * Xa + b1 = A2 * Xa + b2
Xa = (b2 - b1) / (A1 - A2)   # Once again, pay attention to not dividing by zero
</code></pre>

<p>The last thing to do is check that Xa is included into Ia:</p>

<pre><code>if ( (Xa &lt; max( min(X1,X2), min(X3,X4) )) or
     (Xa &gt; min( max(X1,X2), max(X3,X4) )) ):
    return False  # intersection is out of bound
else:
    return True

<p>Every cone is a ""touchable element"". Now I want to put a bitmap texture above each cone. However, bitmap images are all rectangular, so a bitmap texture above one cone would interfere with the bitmap texture above another cone.</p>

<p>I'm wondering what is the best solution to this approach. Should I just create an image which fits (as a rectangle) exactly above the cone and make the non used areas transparent?</p>

<p>A second question is, how do bitmap textures work with stretching? Because this whole circle draws itself to fit the whole screen size, while bitmap textures are pretty much one size. </p>

<p>However, I can help with your second question as stretching bitmaps is not hard. You've got a few options in the Canvas class. For example:</p>

<pre><code>canvas.save();
canvas.scale(xRatio, yRatio);
canvas.drawBitmap(....);
canvas.restore();
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use a Matrix, using <code>matrix.postScale(xRatio, yRatio)</code>, to then generate either a larger bitmap and draw it normally, or pass the matrix in to your <code>canvas.drawBitmap(....)</code> command to make it scale while it draws.</p>

<p>All of these methods assume you have access to the drawing canvas itself. If you are using a view, you can subclass it and override the <code>onDraw(Canvas canvas)</code> method to grab the canvas before it starts drawing it. If you're using a SurfaceHolder, then you should already know how to get the canvas.</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: I forgot the third method I was going to describe. You can use the <code>canvas.drawBitmap(bitmap, srcRect, dstRect, paint)</code> to also make the canvas scale the bitmap to fit the destination rectangle. In short, there are lots of methods to do this - pick the one that's easiest based on your application!</p>

<p>However, it's quite new and  it's got fairly limited browser support at the moment, so it's not ideal.</p>

<p>Some browsers support it using vendor prefixes, which means it's experimental, but you could include them in your stylesheet anyway.</p>

<p>Microsoft Internet Explorer has a completely different mechanism for rotation.</p>

<p>Your final stylesheet might look something like this:</p>

<p>(You'll need to work out the angles yourself for IE! the one I've provided should be okay for 45 degrees)</p>

<p>However, even then you can't be certain that the user's browser will support it, and there may be other quirks you'd need to deal with.</p>

<p>Also, of course, a rotated element will be degraded in quality due to pixellisation on screen. How badly will depend on the quality of the browser's rotation algorithms, but there will always be some loss of quality.</p>

<p>In short, rotation in a browser (for the time being at least) is more of a play-thing than a useful piece of functionality. But it can be done.</p>

","MATLAB m-file help formatting","<matlab><formatting>","2010-10-01 15:32:05","19015","3841529","3","<p>Try this other section in the official documentation. It's more thorough. MATLAB > User's Guide > Desktop Tools and Development Environment > Customizing Help and Demos > Providing Your Own Help and Demos. This describes both simple helptext and generating separate HTML help files.</p>

<p>Here's the helptext formatting I've picked up on and found useful.</p>

<pre><code>function foo(x,y,z)
%FOO One-line description goes here
%
% foo(x,y,z)
%
% Multi-line paragraphs of descriptive text go here. It's fine for them to
% span lines. It's treated as preformatted text; help() and doc() will not
% re-wrap lines. In the editor, you can highlight paragraphs, right-click,
% and choose ""Wrap selected comments"" to re-flow the text.
%
% More detailed help is in the &lt;a href=""matlab: help foo&gt;extended_help""&gt;extended help&lt;/a&gt;.
% It's broken out like this so you can keep the main ""help foo"" text on 
% a single screen, and then break out obscure parts to separate sections.
%
% Examples:
% foo(1,2,3)
%
% See also:
% BAR
% SOMECLASS/SOMEMETHOD

disp(x+y+z);

% documentation on obscure features and options, and so on.

error('This is a placeholder function just for helptext');
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>The first line after the function signature is called the ""H1 line"". It needs to be just one line so it is properly picked up by contentsrpt(), which can autogenerate a Contents.m file from the helptext in your functions</li>
<li>The function name in the H1 line is all caps, regardless of actual capitalization of the function name in the signature</li>
<li>Case matters for the ""See also"". I'm not sure which all cases work; this one does for sure.</li>
<li>Function names after ""See also:"" are all caps. Method names are qualified; I think names of methods in the same class as the current method can be unqualified.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything between the H1 line and ""Examples:"" is just a conventional formatting that I find readable; help() doesn't treat it specially.</p>

<p>You can use a limited form of hyperlinks in help. In particular, you can use  hyperlinks to invoke arbitrary Matlab commands, and point to other sections of helptext by having it invoke help(). You can use this to point to any function; ""function>subfunction"" is just the syntax for addressing subfunctions in help() calls. Unfortunately, since you need to put either ""help"" or ""doc"" in those hyperlinks, it only works in one or the other presentation form. It would be nicer if there were a direct helptext hyperlink form.</p>

"3841122","<p>I am using a Preview to display what the camera see's on the screen.</p>

<p>I can get everything working fine, surface created, surface set and the surface is displayed.</p>

<p>Such as in the picture:</p>

<p>However I have the Preview within an Activity that has other elements in it and it does not make sense for my Activity to be displayed in landscape mode. (Its disabled by default)</p>

<p>So I was wondering is there anyway to just change the orientation of the Preview? And leave the rest of my Activity correctly displayed in Portrait mode?</p>

<p>Or anyway to rotate the preview so that it is displayed correctly?</p>

So this is how I implement it:</p>

<pre><code>public void surfaceChanged(SurfaceHolder holder, int format, int width, int height) {            
    if (isPreviewRunning) {
        mCamera.stopPreview();
    }

    Parameters parameters = mCamera.getParameters();
    Display display = ((WindowManager)getSystemService(WINDOW_SERVICE)).getDefaultDisplay();

    if(display.getRotation() == Surface.ROTATION_0) {
        parameters.setPreviewSize(height, width);                           
        mCamera.setDisplayOrientation(90);
    }

    if(display.getRotation() == Surface.ROTATION_90) {
        parameters.setPreviewSize(width, height);                           
    }

    if(display.getRotation() == Surface.ROTATION_180) {
        parameters.setPreviewSize(height, width);               
    }

    if(display.getRotation() == Surface.ROTATION_270) {
        parameters.setPreviewSize(width, height);
        mCamera.setDisplayOrientation(180);
    }

    mCamera.setParameters(parameters);
    previewCamera();                      
}

And the previewCamera method :

public void previewCamera() {        
    try {           
        mCamera.setPreviewDisplay(mSurfaceHolder);          
        mCamera.startPreview();
        isPreviewRunning = true;
    } catch(Exception e) {
        Log.d(APP_CLASS, ""Cannot start preview"", e);    
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This was on an HTC Desire and I had to initially put in logging statements in each of the rotation checks to say what the rotation was and then debugged on the device and watched the logCat output while I rotated the device. For the HTC Desire, 0 was the phone as you would have expected (portrait), 90 degrees was turning the phone 90 degrees COUNTER-CLOCKWISE (I had assumed it would have been clockwise). In the code you'll see I didn't need to do any display rotation when the phone was at 90 or 180 degrees - the device seemed to handle this itself. Only one point not working properly: The 270 degree rotation is when you turn the device 90 degrees clockwise and the display rotation counters that ok but if you rotate the device 270 degrees counter-clockwise, it doesn't appear to compensate it properly.</p>

<p>P.S. Note the swapover of width and height in the appropriate rotations.</p>

<li>When the thumb is moved it moves to 50 but it should move to the different options.</li>

Rather than go through the overhead of adding TextViews and messing with the padding, just use <code>canvas.drawText</code> to physically draw the text strings in the right place.</p>

<p>You can specify the style and color of the text using a <code>Paint</code> object:</p>

<pre><code>Paint textPaint = new Paint(Paint.ANTI_ALIAS_FLAG);
textPaint.setColor(r.getColor(R.color.text_color));
textPaint.setFakeBoldText(true);
textPaint.setSubpixelText(true);
textPaint.setTextAlign(Align.LEFT);
</code></pre>

<p>And get the exact positioning by using the measureText method on that Paint object to find what width a particular string would be when drawn on a canvas:</p>

<pre><code>textWidth = (int)textPaint.measureText(mTexts[i]);
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can iterate over your array of text strings and draw each string in the right place.</p>

<pre><code>@Override 
protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
  int myWidth = getMeasuredWidth()-LEFT_PADDING-RIGHT_PADDING;
  int separation = myWidth / (mSize-1);

  for (int i = 0; i++; i &lt; mSize) {

<p>I'm using <code>SendKeys()</code> to send keyboard commands to the active window, but I'm not having any luck finding the child window when the application is running through RemoteApp.  It all works as expected when I run the application locally.</p>

<p><a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753844%28WS.10%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft RemoteApp</a> allows users to connect to applications through the RDP protocol, but instead of showing the entire remote Virtual machine, it just shows the application window. To the end user, there is no difference between an application running under RemoteApp and it running on their desktop.  </p>

<p>I've been using ManagedSpy to determine the class name of the .NET application window so that I can use the Win32 API function <code>FindWindowEx</code> to make one of the child windows active, and it works well.  However, I'm having a problem when the application is running over RemoteApp.</p>

<p>I can still use the .NET <code>Process.GetProcessesByName()</code> to find the application, I just have to have it invoke <code>mstsc.exe</code>:</p>

<pre><code>IntPtr hwndChild = IntPtr.Zero;
Process[] processess = Process.GetProcessesByName(""mstsc"");
IntPtr appHandle = IntPtr.Zero;

foreach (Process p in processess)
{
    if ((p.MainWindowHandle != IntPtr.Zero))
    {
        appHandle = p.MainWindowHandle;
    }
}

if (appHandle == IntPtr.Zero)
{
    MessageBox.Show(""Application is not Running."");
    return;
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, I can't use <code>FindWindowEx</code> in the same way. This question revolves around that.</p>

<p>For the unmanaged code to tell me what windows <code>mstsc.exe</code> has active, I used Spy++, but for <code>mstsc.exe</code> it comes back with a different class name, called <code>RAIL_WINDOW</code>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/hgrCN.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Here is the code I'm using to find the Child Window:</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(""USER32.DLL"")]
public static extern bool SetForegroundWindow(IntPtr hWnd);

[DllImport(""user32.dll"", SetLastError = true)]
private static extern IntPtr FindWindowEx(IntPtr parentHandle, IntPtr childAfter, string className, string windowTitle);
hwndChild = FindWindowEx(appHandle, IntPtr.Zero, ""RAIL_WINDOW"", ""MyApplication (Remote)"");
SetForegroundWindow(hwndChild);
</code></pre>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>I can use Spy++ to highlight the active child window in the RemoteApp version of the application, and I get <code>RAIL_WINDOW</code>, but I cannot seem to access this window programmatically. Given the code above, what am I missing to be able to do so?</p></li>
<li><p>Are there other ways of sending keyboard strokes to an application running over Remote App?</p></li>

<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/flpyH.png"" alt=""query plan pic""></p>

<p>As you see on query_plan picture attached (It is query plan for <strong><em>""All in one place""</em></strong> query described below), there are 3 almost the same ""blocks"" - my question is WHY? It seems to me that when I have ""all in one"" (see below) query the ""Init"" block (that is rather heavy) is run three times with different filters instead of being SPOOLED and reused later.</p>

<p>This Query exec time is about 45secs.
It query could be presented in a form:</p>

<pre><code>-- Complex ""All in One place"" Query
WITH init as (
  Init1 complex query here  -- (10 sec to run) if executed alone
)
, step1 as ( select * from init .. joins... where ... etc ), 
step2 as ( select *, row_number() over(__condition__) as rn from step1 where _filter1_)
, step3 as ( select * from step2 where __filter2_), 
.... some more steps could be here ....
select * 
into target_table
from step_N;
-- 45sec CPU time 
</code></pre>

<p>The important thing here is that I use those Step1, Step2, ..., StepN tables within ""WITH"" clause sequentially - Step 1 uses INIT table, so Step2 uses Step1 table, Step3 uses Step2 Table etc. I need this because of different rankings I process after every step that is used later for filtering. </p>

<p>If change this complex CTE query to (I put the result of <strong>Init</strong> query into table, then process other Steps without change):</p>

<pre><code>-- Complex query separated from the rest of the query
 with Init as ( 
   The same Init1 complex query here
) 
select * 
into test_init 
from init;
-- 10sec CPU time

with step1 as ( select * from test_init .. joins... where ... etc ), 
step2 as ( select *, row_number() over(__condition__) as rn from step1 where _filter1_)  , 
step3 as ( select * from step2 where __filter2_), 
.... some more steps could be here ....
select * 
into target_table
from step_N; 
-- 5sec CPU time
</code></pre>

<p>I got about 15secs of exec time, that seems OK to me. Because 10sec is the 1st complex query that is difficult to improve. </p>

<p>So as a result I cant get this MS Sql server 2005 behavior? Could somebody explain this to me? It's rather interesting, I suppose!</p>

<p>It's actually pretty common to use a temporary table to force SQL Server to do the whole complex query first.  Usually, you'd use a temporary table instead of <code>test_init</code>:</p>

<p>What's going on here is string interning.  When you create a bunch of strings with the same value, .Net saves on memory usage by having all references to the same string value actually refer to the same string object.  (See <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.string.intern.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a>, for instance, for details.)</p>

<p>I don't really know why the ListBox behaves exactly the way it does, which is that the first time you select any item in the list, it selects both that item and the first item in the list.  But it doesn't unselect when you click on a new item because checks to see if the <code>SelectedItem</code> is different from the item you just clicked on, and it isn't.  </p>

<p>I got exactly the same behavior by binding a ListBox to a collection of test objects:</p>

<p>I am developing a social web app for poets and writers, allowing them to share their poetry, gather feedback, and communicate with other poets. I have very little formal training in database design, but I have been reading books, SO, and online DB design resources in an attempt to ensure performance and scalability without over-engineering. </p>

<p>The database is MySQL, and the application is written in PHP. I'm not sure yet whether we will be using an ORM library or writing SQL queries from scratch in the app. Other than the web application, Solr search server and maybe some messaging client will interact with the database.</p>

<h2>Current Needs</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create and modify profile details and account settings</li>
<li>Post, tag and categorize their writing</li>
<li>Read, comment on and ""favorite"" other users' posts</li>
<li>""Follow"" other users to get notifications of their activity</li>
<li>Search and browse content and get suggested posts/users (though we will be using the Solr search server to index DB data and run these type of queries)</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I don't see any big flaws in your current setup or schema.</p>

<p>What I'm wonderng is your split into 3 User* tables. I get what you want your intendtion was (having different user-related things seperate) but I don't know if I would go with the exact same thing. If you plan on displaying only data from the <code>User</code> table on the site, this is fine, since the other info is not needed multiple times on the same page but if users need to use their real name and display their real name (like John Doe instead of doe55) than this will slow down things when the data gets bigger since you <em>may</em> require joins. Having the <code>Preferences</code> seperate seems like a personal choice. I have no argument in favor of nor against it.</p>

<p>Your many-to-many tables would not need an addtional PK (e.g <code>PostFavoriteID</code>). A combined primary of both <code>PostID</code> and <code>UserID</code> would be enough since <code>PostFavoriteID</code> is never used anywhere else. This goes for all join tables </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any reason why I shouldn't combine the ExternalAccounts
  table into the UserProfiles table?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As withe the prev. answer, I don't see a advatanage or disadvantage. I <em>may</em> put both in the same table since the <code>NULL</code> (or maybe better <code>-1</code>) values would not bother me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there any reason why I shouldn't combine the PostStats table
  into the Posts table?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would put them into the same table using a trigger to handle the increment of the <code>ViewCount</code> table</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I expand the design to include
  the features we are doing in the
  second version just to ensure that the
  initial schema can support it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are using a normalsied schema so any additions can be done at any time. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there anything I can do to optimize the DB design for Solr
  indexing/performance/whatever?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can't tell you, haven't done it yet but I know that Solr is very powerfull and flexible so I think you should be doing fine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Should I be using more natural primary keys, like Username instead of
  UserID, or zip/area code instead of a
  surrogate LocationID in the Locations
  table?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are <em>many</em> threads here on SO discussing this. Personally, I like a surrogate key better (or another unique number key if available) since it makes queries more easier and faster since an int is looked up easier. If you allow a change of username/email/whatever-your-PK-is than there are massive updates required. With the surrogate key, you don't need to bother.</p>

<p>What I would also do is to add things like <code>created_at</code>, <code>last_accessed</code> at (best done via triggers or procedures IMO) to have some stats already available. This can realy give you valuable stats</p>

<p>Further strategies to increate the performance would be things like memcache, counter cache, partitioned tables,... Such things can be discussed when you are really overrun by users because there may be things/technologies/techniques/... that are very specific to your problem.</p>

"3845014","<p>MySQL Workbench reports a value called ""Key Efficiency"" in association with server health. What does this mean and what are its implications?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/LJAzz.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>From <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/administrator/en/mysql-administrator-health-memory-health.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">MySQL.com</a>, ""Key Efficiency"" is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...an indication of the number of <strong><code>key_read_requests</code></strong> that resulted in actual <strong><code>key_reads</code></strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, so what does that mean. What does it tell me about how I'm supposed to tune the server?</p>
","What is MySQL ""Key Efficiency""","<mysql><reporting><performance>","2010-10-02 08:50:32","64404","3853153","2","<p>""Key Efficiency"" is an indication of how much value you are getting from the index caches held within MySQL's memory.   If your key efficiency is high, then most often MySQL is performing key lookups from within memory space, which is much faster than having to retrieve the relevant index blocks from disk.</p>

<p>The way to improve key efficiency is to dedicate more of your system memory to MySQL's index caches.  How you do this depends on the storage engine you use.  For MyISAM, increase the value of key-buffer-size.  For InnoDB, increase the value of innodb-buffer-pool-size.</p>

<p>However, as Michael Eakins points out, the operating system also holds caches of disk blocks which it has accessed recently.  The more memory that your operating system has available, the more disk blocks it can cache.  Further, the disk drives themselves (and disk controllers in some cases), also have caches - which again can speed up retrieving data from disk.  The hierarchy is a bit like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>fastest - retrieving index data from within MySQL's index cache.  The cost is a few memory operations.</li>
<li>retrieving index data that is held in the OS file system cache.  The cost is a system call (for the read), and some memory operations.</li>
<li>retrieving index data that is held in the disk system cache (controller and drives).  The cost is a system call (for the read), communication with the disk device, and some memory operations.</li>
<li>slowest - retrieving index data from the disk surface.  The cost is a system call, communication with the device, physical movement of the disk (arm movement + rotation).</li>
</ol>

<p>In practice, the difference between 1 and 2 is almost unnoticeable unless your system is very busy.  Also, it is unlikely (unless your system has less spare RAM than your disk controller) that scenario 3 will come into play.  </p>

<p>I have used servers with MyISAM tables with relatively small index caches (512MB), but massive system memory (64GB) and have found it difficult to demonstrate the value of increasing the size of the index cache.   I guess it depends on what else is happening on your server.  If all you are running is a MySQL data base, it is quite likely that the OS cache will be quite effective.  However, if you run other jobs on the same server and these use lots of memory / disk accesses, then these might evict valuable cached index blocks leading to MySQL hitting disk more often.</p>

<p>An interesting exercise (if you have time) is to tinker with your system to make it run slower.  Running a standard workload on large tables, reduce the MySQL buffers until the impact becomes noticeable.   Flush your file system cache by pumping huge amounts (greater than RAM) of irrelevant data through your file system ( cat large-file > /dev/null ).  Watch iostat as your queries run.</p>

<p>""Key Efficiency"" is NOT a measure of how good your keys are.   Well designed keys will have a much larger impact on performance than high ""Key Efficiency"".  MySQL does not have much to help you there, unfortunately.</p>

<p>This is the representation of prototype chain when I created two instances of Book constructor. The screen-shot is taken from ""High Performance Javascript - N.C.Jakas"". 
My confusion is about the Book constructor given in the middle (the yellow box with the heading ""Book""). As every function in javascript is an instance of Function prototype, shouldn't this box (Book) has a <strong>proto</strong> property linking it to prototype of <strong>Function</strong>.? </p>

<p>Additionally it would lead to the question what <code>_proto_</code> of <code>Function</code> would be, crowding the image further.</p>

<p>The author probably thought the diagram and all the displayed relations were already confusing enough in its current form.</p>

<p>I have above mysql table with available dates and prices. Second table includes room details. How can I join two tables to get available rooms between two dates and not get duplicate content.</p>
","Select available rooms between two dates","<php><mysql>","2010-10-02 14:39:13","3085","3846245","3","<p>This is hard to come up with a complete answer for you here, as you are only showing us the table which contains the bookings - we cannot know what range of rooms are available.</p>

<p>SQL which returns the room_id's for rooms which are booked for at least part of the selected period could be:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT `room_id` , COUNT(*)
FROM `bookings`
WHERE `dt` BETWEEN ""[start date]"" AND ""[end date]""
GROUP BY `room_id`;
</code></pre>

<p>If you had a table of rooms (rather than bookings), it would be possible for you to return a list of any rooms not booked during that period with:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT `id`
FROM `rooms`
WHERE `id` NOT IN (
  SELECT DISTINCT( `room_id` )
  FROM `bookings`
  WHERE `dt` BETWEEN ""[start date]"" AND ""[end date]""
);
</code></pre>

<h2>AMENDMENT</h2>

<p>Based on the feedback by OP, the assumptions are now:</p>

<ul>
<li>The table contains details of rooms which are available for a period starting on the date in column <code>dt</code> and ending the following day (ie hotel rooms)</li>
<li>The query should return any rooms which are available for the entirity of the period entered (so only rooms which are available from DAY A to DAY B will be returned.</li>
</ul>

<p>As such, the amended code is:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT room_id
FROM available_rooms
WHERE dt BETWEEN ""[start date]"" AND DATE_SUB(""[end date]"",INTERVAL 1 DAY)
GROUP BY room_id
HAVING COUNT(*)=ABS(DATEDIFF(""[start date]"",""[end date]""));

<p>and then import the project into eclipse. The build path in eclipse now contains an ""Excluded: **"" pattern for the <code>src/main/resource</code> path.

    static extern int GetWindowText(IntPtr hWnd, StringBuilder lpString, int nMaxCount);


[DllImport(""user32.dll"", SetLastError=true, CharSet=CharSet.Auto)]

    if (GetWindowText(WindowHandle, sb, sb.Capacity) == 0)
        throw new Exception(String.Format(""unable to obtain window caption, error code {0}"", Marshal.GetLastWin32Error()));
    Caption = sb.ToString();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here, 'WindowHandle' is the handle of the created window.</p>

<p>In the case you do not have a window handle (I see you don't), you have to enumerate every desktop top-level window, filter them by the creating process (I see the window is created by you application by calling <em>MyFunc</em>, so you know the process ID [*]), and then use some heuristic to determine the required information.</p>

<p>Here is the C# import of the functions you shall use in the case you do not have the handle:</p>

<pre><code>[DllImport(""user32.dll"", ExactSpelling = true, SetLastError = true)]
static extern int GetWindowThreadProcessId(IntPtr hWnd, out int lpdwProcessId);

[DllImport(""user32.dll"", SetLastError = true)]
[return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Bool)]
static extern bool EnumWindows(EnumWindowsProc lpEnumFunc, IntPtr lParam);

private delegate bool EnumWindowsProc(IntPtr hWnd, IntPtr lParam);
</code></pre>

<p>Basically <em>EnumWindows</em> calls <em>EnumWindowsProc</em> for each window found in the current desktop. So you can get the window caption.</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; WindowLabels = new List&lt;string&gt;();

string GetWindowCaption(IntPtr hWnd) { ... }

bool MyEnumWindowsProc(IntPtr hWnd, IntPtr lParam) {
    int pid;

    GetWindowThreadProcessId(hWnd, out pid);

    if (pid == Process.GetCurrentProcess().Id) {
        // Window created by this process -- Starts heuristic
        string caption = GetWindowCaption(hWnd);

        if (caption != ""MyKnownMainWindowCaption"") {
           WindowLabels.Add(caption);
        }
    }

    return (true);
}

void DetectWindowCaptions() {
    EnumWindows(MyEnumWindowsProc, IntPtr.Zero);

    foreach (string s in WindowLabels) {
        Console.WriteLine(s);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>[*] In the case the window is not created by your application (i.e but from another background process), you shall filter the values returned by GetWindowThreadProcessId using another process ID, but this requires another question...</p>

"3849530","<p>I have a custom DefaultMutableTreeNode class that is designed to support robust connections between many types of data attributes (for me those attributes could be strings, user-defined tags, or timestamps).</p>

<p>As I aggregate data, I'd like to give the user a live preview of the stored data we've seen so far. For efficiency reasons, I'd like to only keep one copy of a particular attribute, that may have many connections to other attributes.</p>

<p>Example: The user-defined tag ""LOL"" occurs at five different times (represented by TimeStamps). So my JTree (the class that is displaying this information) will have five parent nodes (one for each time that tag occured). Those parent nodes should ALL SHARE ONE INSTANCE of the DefaultMutableTreeNode defined for the ""LOL"" tag.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, using the add(MutableTreeNode newChild) REMOVES newChild from WHATEVER the current parent node is. That's really too bad, since I want ALL of the parent nodes to have THE SAME child node.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of DOING IT WRONG <em>(Curtis is the author and he should appear FOR ALL THE SHOWS)</em>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/wESH2.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>How can I accomplish this easily in Java?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I've been looking at the code for DefaultMutableTreeNode.add()... and I'm surprised it works the way it does (comments are mine):</p>

<pre><code>public void add(MutableTreeNode child)
{
    if (! allowsChildren)
        throw new IllegalStateException();

    if (child == null)
        throw new IllegalArgumentException();

    if (isNodeAncestor(child))
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Cannot add ancestor node."");

    // one of these two lines contains the magic that prevents a single ""pointer"" from being
    // a child within MANY DefaultMutableTreeNode Vector&lt;MutableTreeNode&gt; children arrays...
    children.add(child); // just adds a pointer to the child to the Vector array?
    child.setParent(this); // this just sets the parent for this particular instance
}

"3849698","<p>I have a table in html with some tabular data. </p>

<p>The thing is that I have designed a delete and edit visually link outside the table (on the left side of the table), that will only be visible when the user hovers the table row.</p>

<p>How can I add these links without messing up the default table layout?</p>

<p>The current problem is that I need to create a  holding the delete and edit link, and this messes up the table structure when they are not visible.</p>

<p>So, is there a way to add a container to a table (needs to follow the table row structure) that is not a td? Or do you know about some examples doing something similar that I could have a look at?<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/1ODE8.jpg"" alt=""Edit table ""></p>

","HTML: How to add a delete link inside a html table, but still visible as outside the table","<html><css>","2010-10-03 12:27:23","1015","3849806","3","<p>It got a little complicated, but there's a demo at <a href=""http://jsbin.com/ariza3/"" rel=""nofollow"">JS Bin</a> to demonstrate my approach. I'm not entirely sure that <code>-webkit-border-radius</code> supports the notation that I used (I tested in Chrome which supports <code>border-radius</code>), so it might be worth checking.</p>

<p>Incidentally, because of the approach I took (mainly to avoid having to manually add classes) to what could be a 'clean' design, there are some near-bleeding-edge CSS selectors, such as <code>tbody tr:nth-child(odd) td:first-child</code>. I think all of this but the <code>:nth-child(odd)</code> pseudo-selector should be understood by IE7+ (with a valid doctype), but I don't have an installation of Windows on which to test my assumption. As this particular rule is only there to overrule the specificity of the <em>earlier</em> selector to add zebra-striping, if neither are understood nothing is broken, it's just a slightly less jazzy table is all.</p>

<p>The CSS is below:</p>

<pre><code>body

<p><strong>Edited</strong></p>

<p>I've added a side-by-side comparison of the above demonstration and an additional approach, which I think <em>might</em>, in the presence of a valid standards-mode doctype, work reasonably well in older browsers.</p>

<p>The revised demo is here: <a href=""http://jsbin.com/ariza3/6/"" rel=""nofollow"">JS Bin</a>, and can, of course, be edited by clicking on the 'Edit using JS Bin' button.</p>

<p>The relevant CSS can also be seen by hovering over the tables (though it probably works better with larger displays).</p>

<hr />

<p><strong>Edited</strong></p>

<p>To add in the all finished version, to the best -I think- of my ability, there's two tables (as can be seen at <a href=""http://jsbin.com/ariza3/6/"" rel=""nofollow"">JS Bin</a> (each using slightly different mark-up, and quite different css) to demonstrate at least two ways this can be achieved.</p>

<h3>Both tables share this CSS:</h3>

<pre><code>  body {
    background-color: #39f;
  }
  th {
    font-weight: bold;
    border-bottom: 2px solid #000;
  }
  th.title {
    border-bottom: 1px solid #000;
  }
    th.hidden {
      border: 0 none transparent;
    }
thead tr th,
tbody tr td {
    width: auto;
    height: 2em;
    vertical-align: center;
    background-color: #fff;
    color: #000;
    padding: 0.5em;
    margin: 0;
    border-collapse: collapse;
  }
</code></pre>

<h3>Next is the 'up-to-date' browsers' CSS:</h3>

<pre><code>    #preferred thead tr th:first-child {
      border: 0 none transparent; 
    }
  #preferred tbody tr:nth-child(odd) td {
    background-color: #ffa;
  }
  #preferred tr th:first-child,
  #preferred tr td:first-child,
  #preferred tbody tr:nth-child(odd) td:first-child {
    color: transparent;
    background-color: transparent;
    padding: 0.5em 0 0.5em 0.5em;
    -webkit-border-top-left-radius: 1em;
    -webkit-border-bottom-left-radius: 1em;
    -moz-border-radius: 1em 0 0 1em;
    border-radius: 1em 0 0 1em;
  }

  #preferred tr:hover td:first-child,
  #preferred tbody tr:nth-child(odd):hover td:first-child  {
    color: #000;
    background-color: #fff;
  }
  #preferred tbody tr:nth-child(odd):hover td:first-child  {
    color: #000;
    background-color: #ffa;
  }
</code></pre>

<h3>And the relevant html mark-up:</h3>

<pre><code>  &lt;table cellspacing=""0"" id=""preferred""&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

        &lt;th&gt;visible&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;visible&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;visible&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;th&gt;visible&lt;/th&gt;

      &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;

<h3>Next is the older browser's CSS:</h3>

<pre><code>    #ieMaybe {
      background-color: #39f;

  #ieMaybe th,
  #ieMaybe td {

  #ieMaybe tr:hover td.hidden,
  #ieMaybe tr td.hidden:hover {

<p>As @Yi Jiang noted, in the comments, there were a couple of errors in the first-posted code, those have been left as is (because I'm starting to go CSS-blind), but the code-blocks above have been directly pasted from the latest working JS Bin demo, so unless <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>'s been playing up, it <em>should</em>, I hope, be fine.</p>

<p>This creates a 4px transparent border, but that can easily be changed. 
Because the opacity only affects the absolute positioned divs the image doesnot become transparent. Two border-divs are needed in this example because this way the image size is variable, if your images always have the same size you could do this with only one.</p>

"3851668","<p>Given n circles with radii r1 ... rn, position them in such a way that no circles are overlapping and the bounding circle is of ""small"" radius.</p>

<p>The program takes a list [r1, r2, ... rn] as input and outputs the centers of the circles.</p>

<ol>
<li>I ask for ""small"" because ""minimum"" radius converts it into a much more difficult problem (minimum version has already been proved to be NP hard/complete - see footnote near end of question). We don't need the minimum. If the shape made by the circles seems to be fairly circular, that is good enough.</li>
<li>You can assume that Rmax/Rmin &lt; 20 if it helps.</li>
<li>A low priority concern - the program should be able to handle 2000+ circles. As a start, even 100-200 circles should be fine.</li>
<li>You might have guessed that the circles need not be packed together tightly or even touching each other.</li>

<hr>

<p><strong>Added info : The circle packing algorithm commonly referred to in google search results is not applicable to this problem.</strong></p>

<p>The problem statement of the other ""Circle packing algorithm"" is thus : Given a complex K ( graphs in this context are called simplicial complexes, or complex in short) and appropriate boundary conditions, compute the radii of the corresponding circle packing for K....</p>

<p>It basically starts off from a graph stating which circles are touching each other (vertices of the graph denote circles, and the edges denote touch/tangential relation between circles). One has to find the circle radii and positions so as to satisfy the touching relationship denoted by the graph.</p>

<p>The other problem does have an interesting observation (independent of this problem) :</p>

<p><strong>Circle Packing Theorem</strong> - Every circle packing has a corresponding planar graph (this is the easy/obvious part), and every planar graph has a corresponding circle packing (the not so obvious part). The graphs and packings are duals of each other and are unique.</p>

<p>We do not have a planar graph or tangential relationship to start from in our problem.</p>

<p>This paper - <strong>Robert J. Fowler, Mike Paterson, Steven L. Tanimoto: Optimal Packing and Covering in the Plane are NP-Complete</strong> - proves that the minimum version of this problem is NP-complete. However, the paper is not available online (at least not easily).</p>

I do have some ideas in that direction but figure I might as well share what I have in case anybody else wants to hack on it too.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/GZXzD.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>It looks like they intersect at the center, but they don't. I decorated the placement function with a nested loop that checks every circle against every other circle (twice) and raises an <code>AssertionError</code> if there is an intersection.</p>

<p>Also, I can get the edge close to perfect by simply reverse sorting the list but I don't think the center looks good that way. It's (pretty much the only thing ;) discussed in the comments to the code.</p>

<p>The idea is to only look at discrete points that a circle might live at and iterate over them using the following generator:</p>

<pre><code>def base_points(radial_res, angular_res):
    circle_angle = 2 * math.pi
    r = 0
    while 1:
        theta = 0
        while theta &lt;= circle_angle:
            yield (r * math.cos(theta), r * math.sin(theta))
            r_ = math.sqrt(r) if r &gt; 1 else 1
            theta += angular_res/r_
        r += radial_res
</code></pre>

<p>This just starts at the origin and traces out points along concentric circles around it. We process the radii by sorting them according to some parameters to keep the large circles near the center (beginning of list) but enough small ones near the beginning to fill in spaces. We then iterate over the radii. within the main loop, we first loop over points that we have already looked at and saved away. If none of those are suitable, we start pulling new points out of the generator and saving them (in order) until we find a suitable spot. We then place the circle and go through our list of saved points pulling out all of the ones that fall within the new circle. We then repeat. on the next radius.</p>

<p>I'll put some ideas I have into play and make it mo`bettah. This might serve as a good first step for a physics based idea because you get to start with no overlaps. Of course it might already be tight enough so that you wouldn't have much room.</p>

<p>Also, I've never played with numpy or matplotlib so I write just vanilla python. There might be something in there that will make it run much faster, I'll have to look.</p>

"3851922","<p>I'm having some trouble figuring out the boost image library. </p>

<p>I could not find any exact documentation on how to use the interleaved_view function included in the boost::gil library. More specifically, I don't know exactly what binary format the raw data is supposed to be stored in.</p>

<p>The only mention of it I could find was in the gil tutorial:</p>

<pre><code>// Calling with 8-bit RGB data into 16-bit BGR
void XGradientRGB8_BGR16(const unsigned char* src_pixels, ptrdiff_t src_row_bytes, int w, int h,
                                 signed short* dst_pixels, ptrdiff_t dst_row_bytes) {
    rgb8c_view_t  src = interleaved_view(w,h,(const rgb8_pixel_t*)src_pixels,src_row_bytes);
    rgb16s_view_t dst = interleaved_view(w,h,(    rgb16s_pixel_t*)dst_pixels,dst_row_bytes);
    x_gradient(src,dst);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, the function prototype says </p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename Iterator&gt;
type_from_x_iterator&lt; Iterator&gt;::view_t     
boost::gil::interleaved_view (std::size_t width, std::size_t height, Iterator pixels, std::ptrdiff_t rowsize_in_bytes)
//Constructing image views from raw interleaved pixel data. 
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, what exactly is the format gil expects in the binary format, and what is rowsize_in_bytes supposed to be?</p>

<p>The only time I've seen an interleaved image before is when working with OpenGL, which was just RGB information for each pixel stored next to each other. I thought rowsize_in_bytes would just literally the size of a row of pixels in bytes, so I tried to write a PNG with this:</p>

<pre><code>void makeImage(const string fileName, const unsigned char * src, const int w, const int h) {
    rgb8c_view_t outImage = interleaved_view(w,h, (const rgb8_pixel_t*) src, w*3*sizeof(unsigned char));
    boost::gil::png_write_view(fileName,outImage);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and the input src was an flat array of size w*h, of format </p>

<pre><code>(char)R, (char)G, (char)B, (char)R, (char)G, (char)B, (char)R, (char)G, (char)B ...
</code></pre>

<p>The image was of just a white box on a black background. However, the results I got were rather... strange</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/cl4E9.png"" alt=""Results""></p>

<p>If anyone has any idea why this happened, and how interleaved_view actually works, that'd be great. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>EDIT: Sorry guys, I just realized my dumb mistake. I got it working now... :( The problem wasn't with the format of the image, but rather that it was row major, and not column major</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/3eanM.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Figure the best way to do this is to have a tree structure that hold all the boxes. But I'm not sure how I can hold basic primitives into a data structure, a tree, for instance. </p>

<p>I'm aware that I can only call the <code>glutDisplayFunc(myDisplay)</code> once, and the rest should handle by the <code>glutKeyboardFunc()</code> </p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated :)</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: thanks for pointing out <code>glutPostRedisplay()</code> but what if I want to make the box selectable and keep tracking the current selected box with <code>glutMouseFunc()</code>, and from there when I add more boxes, I need to know how many child box it has created, so I can provide the right position when new box is drawn. Seems that makes more sense now to use a tree data structure ? Just not sure how I can store the information I need into a tree.</p>

<p>I was using ListPlot to draw a smooth line through some data points.

  xyInterpolation=Interpolation[#,InterpolationOrder-&gt;3]&amp;/@Transpose[myPoints]},

<p>From such an interpolation you should be able to grab your derivatives via implicit differentiation, e.g. dx/dy == (dx/dt)/(dy/dt). A delight to flaunt that notation in a place where it might make some mathematicians puke :)</p>

"3856659","<p>I have an Application that runs tests on a customers account in order to judge if their service is working correctly. During the process of running the tests, the application reads each test and checks to see if it passes / fails / etc... It plays a green checkmark  / red x on the tabPage itself as an imagekey... the imagekey is assigned as so </p>

<pre><code>(tabPage as TabPage).ImageKey = ""pass.png"";

<p>tabPage is actually an object that is passed through to the function so i can refer to it from a different method.</p>

<p>The way i designed my working sheet doesn't help me to calculate working hours easily.</p>

<p>The output in snapshot has been gathered from multiple tables.</p>

<p>Don't worry regarding setDate and timeEntered formatting.</p>

<p>SetDate represents working day.
tsTypeTitle represents type of shift, is it lunch time, etc.
timeEntered represents the actual time.</p>

<p>setDate will have to be trimmed to have only Date and timeEntered should only show time - This will be handled later, don't worry about it.</p>

<p>I need to grab the difference between Shift Started and Shift Ended so i can calculate the wage.</p>

<p>Here is my query in case you want to look at it:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT TimeSheet.setDate, TimeSheetType.tsTypeTitle, TimeSheetDetail.timeEntered
FROM TimeSheet 
    INNER JOIN TimeSheetDetail 
        ON TimeSheet.timeSheetID = TimeSheetDetail.timeSheetID
    INNER JOIN TimeSheetType 
        ON TimeSheetType.timeSheetTypeID = TimeSheetDetail.timeSheetTypeID

"3857931","<p>I have an issue that only seems to affect Safari and Chrome (aka WebKit). I have an overlay that fills the whole screen, and two table rows that I would like to appear on top of the overlay. Everything else on the page should be displayed below the overlay.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Apparently the code sample above displays correctly. However, that is just a sample. It's not the actual code. The HTML is identical, but I am applying the styles dynamically with JavaScript. </p>

<p>Maybe the issue lies with jQuery? I'm using this line to add the positioning to the first table row:</p>

<pre><code>$(firstTableRow).css('position', 'relative').css('z-index', '1000');
</code></pre>

<p>In Firefox (using Firebug) I can see that the style is being applied, however in Safari (using Web Inspector) it says that the ""computed style"" of that table row is statically positioned with a z-index of auto, even though the ""style attribute"" styles say that the position is relative and z-index is 1000.</p>

<p>After the refactoring, all references in <code>C1'</code> to <code>field</code> are changed to <code>helper.getField()</code> and <code>helper.setfield()</code> as appropriate.</p>

<p>I've used Eclipse's refactoring capabilities quite a bit, but I can't figure out a way to automate this.</p>

<p>For instance, ideally I would drag the private field/attribute/member from one class to another and hope that Eclipse asks me how I want to handle the unresolved references.  It offers no suggestions and breaks all of the references.</p>

<p>The operation that I've been repeating is to separate knowledge and behavior that doesn't really belong in the current class.  I'm moving attributes and behavior that references certain fields out of the original class into a new ""helper"" class.  </p>

<p>The first step in my refactoring is to move the fields.  A reference to the helper class exists as a field in the class I'm refactoring from.  In order not to break  <code>C1</code> during the refactoring, I think it would be nice if Eclipse offered to to generate getters and setters in <code>Helper'</code> and update the references in <code>C1</code> to use the getters/setters in the new class.</p>

So how could you possibly access it from another class?  </p>

<p>If you don't wish to break it during a refactor I can give you a little trick I use that kinda helps sometimes.</p>

<p>When you create your class, make it either an inner class of the existing class or a second class in the same file.</p>

<p>If you make it an inner class you can copy the methods over first and they can refer to the member in the other class.  Once you get all the functionality ported over you can move the variable.  At this point none of the references to the variable should be updated since you access it the same way regardless of which class it was in.</p>

<p>Making a class a second class in the same file can be nice if you are splitting apart functionality as well--it lets you access everything at once without mousing between windows.  When you are done just drag the new class into it's own java file, recalculate imports, reformat make it public and save it.</p>

<p>I nearly always use one of these methodologies when creating a new class that interacts with existing classes.</p>

"3859275","<p>For use in a simple project of mine, I've hit a bit of a blockade.</p>

<p>I have a series of points in a grid, ""walls"" and ""open space.""  Space outside the grid is assumed to be walls.  I have an arbitrary number of points in this grid which are open, and I must determine if which ones are connected will change if I make one specific block in the grid change from open space to a wall.</p>

<p>What's an efficient way of doing this?   </p>

.</p>

<p>Example:  Determine whether the presence/absence of paths between the red squares will change if the green square is a wall or open space. (PS: I sincerely apologize for my terrible grid)</p>

<p>Right now, I'm assuming some sort of cellular automata is best, but I'm not sure.  I've looked at pathfinding before, but never really saw anything that got into this sort of problem.  </p>

<p>Please note:  I don't care how long the paths are, (I know their maximum length) they just MUST EXIST.  So finding the BEST path between points is not necessary.</p>

<p>Oh, and while it shouldn't matter, I'm writing this project in Java, but any language (or pseudo-code) or an English description of an algorithm will suffice.  (I know most of the Curly Bracket languages, and limited Haskell and LISP, they'll all do.)</p>
","Finding Paths between a Series of Points","<path-finding>","2010-10-04 21:28:11","438","3859533","1","<p>This might not be the best solution, but a solution would be the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start by flood-filling the grid until all points that are connected are assigned the same number (by connected I mean adjacent or on the same number 'island'). There are many ways to do this, none of which need to be too complicated. Simply running through the grid from first to last node and filling it if it hasn't been filled already is an option.</li>
<li>A path between nodes that are adjacent to or on the same number can only be broken IF you put in a wall that splits the island into two. So, when you add a wall, check if that's the case. You can check this reasonably efficiently by using A*: From all 4 nodes that are adjacent to the new wall, check that if they had the same number, they can still reach each other.</li>
<li>If the wall didn't cause a split: no paths were broken, all is the same.</li>
<li>If the wall did cause a split: Flood-fill the grid again, and again check whether two nodes are adjacent to or on the same numbers (If the blocks you are checking are always open, it'll always be adjacent).</li>
</ul>

<p>Checking for all nodes is reasonably efficient in this way (checking n*n/2-n/2 paths will take O(n^2) I think), but adding new walls might be made more efficient if only the necessary islands are created without flood-fill, but that could be more difficult to implement.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong><br/>
Here's where my code is now. Cleaned up a bit but still producing the same effect:</p>

<pre>
// Read data in chunks from the original file
[originalFile seekToEndOfFile];
NSUInteger fileLength = [originalFile offsetInFile];
[originalFile seekToFileOffset:0];
NSUInteger chunkSize = 100 * 1024;
NSUInteger offset = 0;

while(offset &lt; fileLength) {
    NSData *chunk = [originalFile readDataOfLength:chunkSize];
    offset += chunkSize;

    // Convert the chunk to a base64 encoded string and back into NSData
    NSString *base64EncodedChunkString = [chunk base64EncodedString];
    NSData *base64EncodedChunk = [base64EncodedChunkString dataUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];

    // Write the encoded chunk to our output file
    [encodedFile writeData:base64EncodedChunk];

    // Cleanup
    base64EncodedChunkString = nil;
    base64EncodedChunk = nil;

    // Update progress bar
    [self updateProgress:[NSNumber numberWithInt:offset] total:[NSNumber numberWithInt:fileLength]];
}
</pre>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong><br/>
So it looks like files that are larger than 100 KB get scrambled, but files under 100 KB are fine. It's obvious that something is off on my buffer/math/etc, but I'm lost on this one. Might be time to call it a day, but I'd love to go to sleep with this one resolved.</p>

<p>Here's an example:<br/><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/gN1Tx.jpg"" alt="""" title=""Hosted by imgur.com"" /></p>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong><br/>
After doing some testing I have found that the same code will work fine for a small image, but will not work for a large image or video of any size. Definitely looks like a buffer issue, right?</p>

<p>Hey there, trying to base64 encode a large file by looping through and doing it one small chunk at a time. Everything seems to work but the files always end up corrupted. I was curious if anyone could point out where I might be going wrong here:</p>

<pre>
    NSFileHandle *originalFile, *encodedFile;
    self.localEncodedURL = [NSString stringWithFormat:@""%@-base64.xml"", self.localURL];

    // Open the original file for reading
    originalFile = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForReadingAtPath:self.localURL];
    if (originalFile == nil) {
        [self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(updateStatus:) withObject:@""Encoding failed."" waitUntilDone:NO];
        return;
    }
    encodedFile = [NSFileHandle fileHandleForWritingAtPath:self.localEncodedURL];
    if (encodedFile == nil) {
        [self performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(updateStatus:) withObject:@""Encoding failed."" waitUntilDone:NO];
        return;
    }

    // Read data in chunks from the original file
    [originalFile seekToEndOfFile];
    NSUInteger length = [originalFile offsetInFile];
    [originalFile seekToFileOffset:0];
    NSUInteger chunkSize = 100 * 1024;
    NSUInteger offset = 0;
    do {
        NSUInteger thisChunkSize = length - offset > chunkSize ? chunkSize : length - offset;
        NSData *chunk = [originalFile readDataOfLength:thisChunkSize];
        offset += [chunk length];

        NSString *base64EncodedChunkString = [chunk base64EncodedString];
        NSData *base64EncodedChunk = [base64EncodedChunkString dataUsingEncoding:NSASCIIStringEncoding];

        [encodedFile writeData:base64EncodedChunk];

        base64EncodedChunkString = nil;
        base64EncodedChunk = nil;

    } while (offset &lt; length);

With base64, each chunk has to be a multiple of 3. So this resolved the issue:</p>

<p>Once I had that, the corruption went away. But then I ran into memory leak issues, so I added the autorelease pool apprach taken from this post: <a href=""http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?ReadAFilePieceByPiece"" rel=""nofollow""><a href=""http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?ReadAFilePieceByPiece"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cocoadev.com/index.pl?ReadAFilePieceByPiece</a></a></p>

I've made an xml and ajaxed it to grab points based on where the user is on the map.
It works well, and in FF, IE8 no problems when they click the points. On IE7 it firstly misses the cross at the top right, has some problems with the border (fixed that with some margin) and more importantly cuts out an portion of the image which I can't figure out.</p>

<p>Some compilers support an option to turn recognition of trigraphs off, or disable trigraphs by default and require an option to turn them on.

<p>I can't seem to work out how to handle the birthdays and put them into groups of 10 years.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Ideally the X axis would be percent rather than thousands :)</p>

<p>IF you wish this to be closer (close the gap between these) what is causing the space is the DIV.widget in styling.css, margin:8px; besides that, I see nothing causing space at this point with that change - I tested this in IE8 and removing that CSS element setting did indeed push them directly conjunctual with no space between.</p>

<p>Now if what you mean is moving the ""stats"" up directly below the ""profilestats"" then that is another matter which can be resolved a couple of different ways.</p>

<ol>
<li>put ""profilestats"" and ""stats"" in a div together (with ""cal"" and ""logins"" in
another div together, and float both ""container"" divs left.</li>
<li>Use the float:left and float: right on the left and right
elements, but that will introduce a space between if the width is
extended (browser width) unless addressed through additional css.</li>
</ol>

<p>In this case, I would opt for #1 as the css is easier to control.</p>

<p>NOTE: be cautious of margins on IE6 in float left elements at times it can be inconsistent.</p>

<p>How can I create a view like that on iPad, and what would be a best way to implement it on iPhone considering screen size constraints.</p>
","How to get the Template Chooser/Document Browser view on iOS?","<iphone><ipad><uiview><ios4><ios>","2010-10-05 16:54:01","503","4261650","2","<p>There isn't any built-in view that will provide that functionality. Which means there will be quite some work to duplicate that functionality. </p>

<p>What you can try is:</p>

<p>1) Create a new <code>UIViewController</code> with a nib.</p>

<p>2) Add the top bar and an <code>UIScrollView</code> with opaque = NO and alpha = 0.</p>

<p>3) If you have a fixed number of ""templates"" they can be added directly in the nib. You should be able to use <code>UIImageView</code></p>

<p>4) Otherwise you can add the ""templates"" dynamically in e.g. <code>viewDidLoad</code>. The only part which can be a little bit tricky is calculating the frame. The following pseudo code should get you started. </p>

<pre><code>int MARGIN = 20;
float templateWidth = self.scrollView.bounds.size.width / 3;
float templateHeight = 300;

for (int i = 0; i &lt; [templates count]; i++) {
  int row = i / 3;
  int col = i % 3;

  float x = MARGIN + col * templateWidth;
  float y = MARGIN + row * templateHeight;
  CGRect templateFrame = CGRectMake(x, y, width - 2 * MARGIN, height - 2 * MARGIN);

  // initialize `UIImageView` or similar

  templateView.frame = templateFrame;
  [self.scrollView addSubView:templateView];
}

self.scrollView.contentSize = CGSizeMake(self.scrollView.bounds.width, /* max bottom of templates */);
} 
</code></pre>

<p>After you have got the layout perfected the rest should be quite straightforward since you only need to respond to taps on your template images. Take a look at <code>UITapGestureRecognizer</code> for one way of doing that.</p>

<p>Regarding the iPhone. I would probably do it in the way you select a document in the iWorks apps. Only one template is displayed on screen at the time and you swipe left/right to choose. But it all depends on the context. Perhaps a table view is better suited for the iPhone.</p>

<p>Good luck! </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/mEd4W.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>In the image, the light red boxes indicate the <code>MKMapRect</code> being rendered in each call to <code>drawMapRect</code>.  The problem is illustrated in the red circle where, as you can see, only part of the triangle is being rendered.  I'm assuming that its being clipped to the <code>MKMapRect</code>, though the documentation for <code>MKOverlayView:drawMapRect</code> makes me think this shouldn't be happening.  </p>

<p>From the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You should also not make assumptions that the view’s frame matches the bounding rectangle of the overlay. The view’s frame is actually bigger than the bounding rectangle to allow you to draw lines for things like roads that might be located directly on the border of that rectangle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My current solution is to draw objects more than once if they are in a maprect that is slightly larger than then maprect given to drawMapRect but this causes me to draw some things more than needed.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a way to increase the size of the clipping area in drawMapRect so this isn't an issue?  Any other suggestions are also welcome.</p>

"3866182","<p>I need to place a button immediately above a dynamically populated UIViewTable. It feels right to not populate the first cell (row 0), but rather utilize the header area, so I use the UITableViewDelegate method to programmatically create a UIView containing a UIButton:</p>

<pre><code>- (UIView *)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView viewForHeaderInSection:(NSInteger)section
{        
    UIView *headerView = [[[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,0, 320, 44)] autorelease]; // x,y,width,height

    [headerView addSubview:reportButton];
    return headerView;    
}

<p>Make your application a WPF Application.  This will automatically give you an application, Window class, and everything else you need to get started.  Making a WPF application is just like any other application, except that you need to start the message pump, create the application, setup your startup window, etc.  The ""WPF Application"" template in Visual Studio does all of that for you...</p>

<p>Until you understand what all is happening, I'd recommend starting with that, and customizing from there.</p>

<p>you are calling <code>change_display(display)</code>, but you have not created/filled a variable named <code>display</code>. you can't have multiple elements with the same id. you can't directly access an html element by id- you have to get a reference to it using the id.</p>

<p>some minor things we'll clean up right away:
the call to <code>change_display</code> is not needed for <code>body</code>'s <code>load</code> event. calling js from <code>href</code> is bad form.</p>

"3869261","<p>I have a database table that holds parent and child records much like a Categories table. The ParentID field of this table holds the ID of that record's parent record...</p>

<p>My table columns are: SectionID, Title, Number, ParentID, Active</p>

<p>I only plan to allow my parent to child relationship go two levels deep. So I have a section and a sub section and that it.</p>

<p>I need to output this data into my MVC view page in an outline fashion like so...</p>

<ol>
<li>Section 1

<ul>
<li>Sub-Section 1 of 1</li>
<li>Sub-Section 2 of 1</li>
<li>Sub-Section 3 of 1</li>

<li>Sub-Section 2 of 2</li>
<li>Sub-Section 3 of 2</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Section 3</li>
</ol>

<p>I am using Entity Framework 4.0 and MVC 2.0 and have never tried something like this with LINQ. I have a FK set up on the section table mapping the ParentID back to the SectionID hoping EF would create a complex ""Section"" type with the Sub-Sections as a property of type list of Sections but maybe I did not set things up correctly.</p>

<p>So I am guessing I can still get the end result using a LINQ query. Can someone point me to some sample code that could provide a solution or possibly a hint in the right direction?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ZCrfR.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>I was able to straighten out my EDMX so that I can get the sub-sections for each section as a property of type list, but now I realize I need to sort the related entities.</p>

<pre><code>var sections = from section in dataContext.Sections
                       where section.Active == true &amp;&amp; section.ParentID == 0
                       orderby section.Number
                       select new Section

                        SectionID = section.SectionID,
                        Title = section.Title,
                        Number = section.Number,

"3870748","<p>I'm trying to find out what effects the Photoshop ""Poster edges"" filter is composed of. It seems it's a combination of edge detection and posterization, but I haven't been able to duplicate it, not even close, with these so I guess I'm missing something. The image below shows the same image before and after the Poster edges filter:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/EeVL4.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I've tried performing posterization (and quantization) on the image, along with edge detection using Sobel, but apparently Photoshop is doing something different as the results are very different. Basically the posterization looks very different and edges are very weak compared to the photoshop filter.</p>

<p>So does anybody know how the Poster edges filter is implemented, or have any idea what image-processing should be done to achieve the latter image from the former.</p>

<p>Not that it really matters, but I'm using Java, and my image filtering code is based for the most part on the filters found here: <a href=""http://www.jhlabs.com/ip/filters/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.jhlabs.com/ip/filters/index.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> Description of the filter from adobe.com:</p>

<p><i>Poster Edges Reduces the number of colors in an image (posterizes it) according to the posterization option you set, and finds the edges of the image and draws black lines on them. Large broad areas have simple shading, and fine dark detail is distributed throughout the image.</i></p>
","Implementing Photoshop's ""Poster edges"" -filter","<java><image-processing>","2010-10-06 08:37:26","6178","3944712","3","<p><em>Regarding the edges:</em> I would assume that Photoshop uses something more sophisticated than a simple derivative filter (like Sobel) for edge detection. There are edge detection algorithms that try to find only ""salient"" edges, i.e. those that are relevant to human vision, edges a human artist would draw if he does a line sketch. An old and (rather) simple algorithm that goes in this direction (at least a bit) is the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector"" rel=""noreferrer"">Canny edge detector</a>. You should be able to find an implementation of this one. Google for ""salient edges"" for current research literature, but don't expect implementations or nice pseudocode in research papers.</p>

<p><em>Regarding posterization:</em> Given their talks at SIGGRAPH, the Adobe guys are very much into bilateral filtering (please Google, I can't link any more), a smoothing technique that preserves important edges. I think if you apply the bilateral filter and posterize afterwards you should come closer to the look you want. Unfortunately, efficiently implementing the bilateral filter is not trivial.</p>

<p><strong>Update for anyone still interested in this topic</strong></p>

<p>The Bilateral filter, which I suggested above, is increasingly replaced with the <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jiansun/papers/guidedfilter_eccv10.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Guided filter</a>, at least in the Computer Vision community (the graphics people don't seem to have realized the Guided filter yet). The Guided filter achieves similar results, but is much easier to implement efficiently. The exact algorithm for the Guided filter is highly efficient, while efficient Bilateral filtering requires approximations or insanely complicated algorithms.</p>

"3874706","<p>After doing some reading on the Model View Controller pattern it seems that the pattern is implemented quite differently in web frameworks vs desktop frameworks. With web based MVC frameworks the view and model never communicate directly. They can only communicate with the controller. But in desktop implementations, it seems that the view and model can communicate directly which doesn't make sense to me. That would seem to defeat the purpose of MVC of having separate, clean, isolated layers. Plus, what does the controller do if the view and model communicate directly?</p>

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" class=""home""&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" class=""about""&gt;About Us&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can use CSS to display the image as a background image when the element is hovered:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" class=""home""&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

nav ul li.home:hover {
background: url(../images/home-hover.jpg);
display: block;  /* apply this to give the element the dimensions of your image*/
width: 69px; /*width of your nav image*/
height: 25px; /*height of your nav image*/
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is just a quick example to get you started, but you need to set it up for each element.</p>

From what I know we cannot change the height of tabhost. I'm guessing that they laid the ""Frank Cho"" view over the tabhost to give it the appearance of being shorter but I may be wrong. Anyone know what's going on?</p>

You need to set the tab indicator to some custom layout (with your drawables) and you should be good to go.   </p>

<p>Here's an semi-example:</p>

final TextView indicator = (TextView) getLayoutInflater().inflate(
                            R.layout.tab_indicator,

<pre><code>&lt;TextView xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
    android:id=""@+id/tab_label""

"3879599","<p>I'm just starting game development and I thought a game like Tank wars or Worms would be nice.
The hardest part I can think of so far is making the terrain destructible and I want to know how it's done before doing the easy parts.</p>
<p>I thought that explosion could have a mask texture which could be scaled for different weapons. Then using that mask I should make underlying terrain transparent (and optionally draw a dark border).

<p>How do I achieve that?
Do I have to change the alpha value pixel by pixel or can I use some kind of masking technique? Drawing a blue circle on top of the terrain isn't an option.</p>

<p>As an overall design, you need to keep track of: the original texture, the ""darkness"" applied, and the ""transparency"" applied. One thing I can say almost for sure is you want to ""accumulate"" the results of the explosions somewhere - what you don't want to be doing is maintaining a list of all explosions that have ever happened.</p>

<p>So you have surfaces for texture, darkness and transparency. You could probably merge darkness and transparency into a single surface with a single channel that stores ""normal"", ""dark"" (or a level of darkness) and ""transparent"".</p>

<p>Because you probably don't want the dark rings to get progressively darker where they intersect, when you apply an explosion to your darkness layer with the <code>max</code> function (<code>Math.Max</code> in C#).</p>

<p>To produce your final texture you could just write from the darkness/transparency texture to your original texture or a copy of it (you only need to update the area that each explosion touches).</p>

<p>Or you could use a pixel shader to combine them - the details of which are beyond the scope of this question. (Also a pixel shader won't work on XNA 4.0 on Windows Phone 7.)</p>

<p>Definitely. Transaction demarcation should be done at the service layer level, not at the DAO layer level: </p>

<ul>
<li>the unit of work is the service, not the DAO</li>
<li>you want a transaction to span multiple DAOs if required.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>What I don't like is that most transactions exist only because they are required for hibernate to work properly.</p>

<p>You should maybe elaborate this part because transactions are not Hibernate specific. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And when I really need a transaction for a job calling multiple service methods, it seems I don't have a choice to keep initializing transactions from the jobs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to call multiple services inside a transaction initiated from the Job layer, declare your services as transactional with <a href=""http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/Propagation.html#REQUIRED"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>REQUIRED</code></a> semantics (the default) and rely on Spring transaction propagation (this applies unless you need a remote call; in that case, use EJBs). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So moving @Transactional annotations from DAO to service doesn't seem to make any difference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It <strong>does</strong> make a difference and the fact that you need to initiate transactions from the Job layer when running batches doesn't make things different.</p>

<p>I warmly recommend to read the <a href=""http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/transaction.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chapter 9. Transaction management</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(...) my main problem comes from Hibernate. Sorry if I wasn't clear. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No problem. It's just that when a question is vague, you often get a vague answer :)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>From hibernate documentation: ""Database transactions are never optional. All communication with a database has to occur inside a transaction."". That's why developers put DAO methods transactional on my project. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry but the above statement only says that the <em>""communication with a database has to occur <strong>inside</strong> a transaction""</em>, nothing more, and deciding where to start transaction is left at your discretion (typically the service layer). If you do it at the DAO level, what if <code>MySuperService</code> calls <code>DaoFoo</code> and <code>DaoBar</code> and <code>DaoBar</code> fails? In such cases, you'll probably want to rollback all the changes, not only those performed in <code>DaoBar</code>. Hence the need to control transaction where the unit of work starts. </p>

<p>IMHO, the developers need some guidance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Does that mean all my services should be transactional? Even when I just read data for example? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, I suggest to read <a href=""http://community.jboss.org/wiki/Non-transactionaldataaccessandtheauto-commitmode"" rel=""noreferrer"">Non-transactional data access and the auto-commit mode</a> (the little brother of <a href=""http://community.jboss.org/wiki/Sessionsandtransactions"" rel=""noreferrer"">Sessions and transactions</a>) to clarify things about <em>""read-only transactions""</em>. Reading the whole page is worth it but let me just quote this specific part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many application developers think they
  can talk to a database outside of a
  transaction. This obviously isn’t
  possible; <strong>no SQL statement can be send
  to a database outside of a database
  transaction</strong>. The term nontransactional
  data access means there are no
  explicit transaction boundaries, no
  system transaction, and that the
  behavior of data access is that of the
  autocommit mode. It doesn’t mean no
  physical database transactions are
  involved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once you'll be done with the above link, the next suggested reading will be <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ts1.html#N101B1"" rel=""noreferrer"">@Transactional read-only flag pitfalls</a>. Here is the relevant part:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(...) The bottom line is that when you
  use an ORM-based framework, the
  read-only flag is quite useless and in
  most cases is ignored. But if you
  still insist on using it, always set
  the propagation mode to SUPPORTS, as
  shown in Listing 9, so no transaction
  is started:</p>
  
  <p><strong>Listing 9. Using read-only and <code>SUPPORTS</code> propagation mode for select

<pre><code>@Transactional(readOnly = true, propagation=Propagation.SUPPORTS)
public TradeData getTrade(long tradeId) throws Exception {
   return em.find(TradeData.class, tradeId);
}
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Better yet, just avoid using the
  <code>@Transactional</code> annotation altogether
  when doing read operations, as shown
  in Listing 10:</p>

<p>The only way I can think of doing this with a DataGrid is catching focus events on the individual cell controls (e.g. TextBoxes in the DataGrid) and use the position of the selected control <em>relative to the parent</em> to work out the border position.

<p>I'm using an ItemsControl control (but could easily use another control) to display this information. I'm able to group the information by the property but I'd like to be able to surround the entire group with a border. I'm not wanting to surround each item in the group by the entire group.</p>

You will probably want to customize this more, but you should be able to get the general idea from this snippet.</p>
<p>the main thing to know is that you are binding to a GroupItem.  Basically there are 3 properties on a GroupItem.  the Name (of the group), the ItemCount (how many items in your grouping) and the items themselves.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;ControlTemplate TargetType=&quot;{x:Type GroupItem}&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/Border&gt;

&lt;/ControlTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
When you Group a collection of items, the source is not a collection of your items, but a collection of GroupItems, wich then contains the items from your collection that belong to that group. this is why the <code>x:Type</code> is GroupItem.   No binding is required here, other then to properties of the GroupItem that you wish to display.</p>
<p>You should put this in your <code>&lt;ItemControl&gt;</code> XAML like so:</p>
<pre><code>    &lt;ItemsControl&gt;
        &lt;ItemsControl.GroupStyle&gt;

<p>I am assuming your problem is to find the actual button again and not setting the background color. You could likewise check for the control being a button and its text being ""button2"" but if the text can change depending on the UI language that's probably not a good idea.</p>

<p><strong>ETA:</strong> Totally forgot that you can use the control's <code>Name</code> property for this as well.</p>

<p>If you just want to change the background color of the button in a response to an <em>event</em> from the button you can just use the <code>sender</code> argument of the event handler, though.</p>

<p>What I noticed here is that the results as painted by the script (<code>js/asset.js</code>) are different in various browsers. Especially in Opera there is much more <em>""green""</em> in the painting than in Chrome</p>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p><strong>How this is caused. Different random seeds? Different rounding or different color behavior in Opera?</strong></p>

<p>Note: It is exactly the same script in both browsers, so perhaps you could have a look at it in both Chrome and Opera.</p>

<p>If you ensure that the pixel values are integers in the right range, Opera works fine.</p>

For debugging purposes if you want you program to carry on executing regardless of this exception you could surround the section of code that is causing the problem in a try/catch block and just ignore the exception although this is not good practice for production code.  </p>

<pre><code>try
{

catch (Exception ex)

<p>As mentioned before this is not good practice for production code. Exceptions should ideally be handled when thrown and not ignored. Failure to do so could lead to all sorts of hard to debug problems down the line but for debugging purposes, if you need to see further into the program execution, this may help.</p>

"3888932","<p>I'm going through <a href=""http://bitbucket.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bitbucket</a> and I can't seem to find any <a href=""https://www.mercurial-scm.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mercurial</a> repositories that look like what I suspect our repository would look like, provided we switch to Mercurial.</p>

<p>As such, I'm wondering, is there a workflow that we're not considering here?</p>

<p>The thing I'm talking about is that I did a small automated test. We're 14 people that work on the same project, split into 4 scrum teams. To simulate 14 (I picked 10, round number) people working in parallel on the code, using Mercurial DVCS, pushing to the same central master repository, I wrote a script.</p>

<ol>
<li>I created a new ""master"" repository, and then cloned it for 10 virtual people</li>
<li>I then ran a 1000 iteration loop, picking a random clone, and doing one of the following:

<ul>
<li>10% of the time, do a pull from master, merge, commit merge, and push</li>
<li>90% of the time, do a local change and commit</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that I ensured that there would never be merge conflicts by simply making each virtual person work on his own file.</p>

<p>This would simulate people working locally by doing 1+ commits before pulling, merging, and pushing (to avoid 2+ heads in the master repo). It might be that this workflow is wrong.</p>

<p>This is a sample of what the repository now looks like (screenshot + link to repo):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/SVdbE.png"" alt=""sample screenshot from TortoiseHg""></p>

<p><strike>The repository can be found here: <a href=""http://hg.vkarlsen.no/hgweb.cgi/parallel_test/graph"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://hg.vkarlsen.no/hgweb.cgi/parallel_test/graph</a>.</strike> <em>Unfortunately this repository is no longer available and I no longer have a copy of the code due to an unfortunate backup incident, but this was just an example for people to visit, it should not be important any more</em></p>

<p>This looks awfully messy, and as I said, I can't seem to find any repositories that have similar history. By ""messy"", I mean that it looks like older history of the project will almost always have 10 parallel branches. Close to the top, it tapers off of course, but it will expand as people that are currently working in their local repository pushes to the master.</p>

<p>So I have two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can anyone show me a repository that has similar history? Since I can't seem to find any, I'm starting to wonder about what kind of conclusions I can draw from that...</li>
<li>Is there something wrong with our workflow (that is, the workflow I've laid out here)? Should we rebase/squash/transplant, delegate push responsibility to one person, other things, instead of the way it was done here?</li>
</ol>
","Mercurial repositories with many active developers?","<mercurial>","2010-10-08 08:39:17","725","3889317","2","<p>Impressive preparation! </p>

<ol>
<li><p>It always looks messy if you go back a bit and look at all old commits at the same time. It always tapers of, even looking at a small bit old history. See <a href=""http://hg.intevation.org/mercurial/crew/graph/12402?revcount=120"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://hg.intevation.org/mercurial/crew/graph/12402?revcount=120</a> for instance. This is not the most recent commit, but shows all history up to that commit.</p></li>
<li><p>Rebase helps quite a lot, especially if persons are working on separate areas. (I usually check the incoming commits to see if there are potential file or functionality conflicts, and if not, I do rebase.) </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Rebase is not fool-proof though, so merge is the preferred ""safe"" action, but it leaves more ""garbage"" in the history. A trade-off.</p>

<p>Rebase is sort-of like the bog standard SVN update. The existing stuff is made baseline and your changes go on top, cross your fingers it still works. It's useful, but there are times when you feel safer having yours, theirs and the merge as separate commits in the history.</p>

<p>There is also commit-squashing as an option (histedit extension maybe), which squashes all in-between commits to one. This is useful when you're about to push and want to transferring many partials commits in your own repo as a single commit to the main.</p>

"3889785","<p>I'm having difficulty with building a HTML email. I currently have converted my entire email to an 8 row table in the below order:</p>

<ol>
<li>Header (image)</li>
<li>Date Field</li>
<li>Content Field</li>
<li>Content Base (rounded bottom image)</li>
<li>Footer top (rounded top image)</li>
<li>Footer</li>
<li>Footer Base (rounded bottom image)</li>
</ol>

<p>As you can see, four of these fields have an image in them. I've been very strict with the layout of my table, making it 550px wide, the images themselves are 550px wide and I use border-collapse on the table to remove the appearence of field edges.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that all the fields without images in them stick out an extra couple of pixels, which as I'm using rounded bottoms and tops it kinda ruins the layout. I simple can't fathom why it's doing this.</p>

<p>The images are added as per the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag and what I THINK is happening is that it's putting a spacing between the edge of the field and the image and as the rest of the table is dependent on the width of the largest one it's pushing the others out a couple of pixels. I am struggling to find a solution to this, I've tried lots of different things such as minus margins on the images and tables. Can anybody offer any solutions to this?</p>

<p>The image below demonstrates this ""stepping"" and although minor, upon exporting to outlook it appears to double. The image starts above the line ""Hydref 2010"" - </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/5Mymm.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>UPDATE: I used the cellspacing and cellpadding commands and reduced them to 0 which fixed the display in a browser, but in Outlook, it's the same</p>

<p>You have taken the right approach to use tables, and the problem you are having is one I have seen before, but for the life of my I can't remember how I fixed it.</p>

<p>Have you tried condensing your columns into one row of markup:</p>

<p>If that fails, you could always split your columns, so you have a spacer either side of the title and a col-span on the main images?</p>

<p><strong>A screenshot of the issue:</strong> </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ipsX5.jpg"" alt=""ck-dash-tab.jpg""></p>

<p><strong>The issue:</strong> </p>

<p>When you look at the page, you'll see a toolbar sort of dash at the top of the page, but just below the site header (its the piece that says ""CUREkids"").</p>

<p>When you hover over any area of that toolbar there is a small green tab on the left that animates out from behind it (its the piece with the question mark on it). When clicked, the tab toggles open a descriptive <a href=""http://www.slidedeck.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Slidedeck</a> interface. So far all is well.</p>

<p>The problem is that if you mouse across the toolbar too quickly, there is a screwy glitch that causes the jQuery rules to fire in a strange way that results in the tab coming out from behind, but going back in overtop of the toolbar.</p>

<p><strong>Additional details:</strong></p>

<p>The way the script works is that the tab is hidden behind the toolbar by default, and the jQuery first animates it left to come out away from the toolbar, then changes the z-index to bring it actually over top of the toolbar element for maximum usability and clicking area on the tab. All this happens on mouseOver. On mouseOut the reverse occurs (z-index changed to lower than the toolbar, and then animates right back to where it was located).</p>

<p><strong>My thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I think there must be an issue with how the script is written that possibly could be tweaked so that when the mouseOver event happens so quickly it doesn't result in the overlap bug.</p>

<p>All help is appreciated.</p>

<p><code>$(""#what-tag"").stop(true, true).css(""z-index"", ""-1"");</code></p>

<p>Check out <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/stop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.jquery.com/stop/</a></p>

<p>The first <code>true</code> passed to <code>.stop(true, true)</code> will remove all queued animations. The second <code>true</code> is the key in this situation - it basically jumps to the end of the function you defined for mouseenter and fires its callback immediately. In this case, by using <code>.stop(true, true)</code>, you ensure that the z-index will always be set to 1 before setting it to -1.</p>

<p>I think what is currently happening is that it's setting the z-index to -1 <em>before</em> the mouseenter callback function fires.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Unrelated - you should also look into caching your jquery selectors into variables. You are calling <code>$(""#what-tag"")</code> six times in this hover method. If you define a variable above the hover method like this: <code>var $whatTag = $(""#what-tag"")</code> and replace the references inside the hover method, it will work faster.</p>

"3893429","<p>I'm designing an application that will use <strong>Oracle</strong>, and we have this <em>department hierarchy</em> that we need to map in our database.  Some thing that looks like this (I'm pretty sure you all know what I'm talking about but I'll include a piece of the ERD just in case):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/pN3oX.gif"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>So it will have data stored that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>[1 | 0]
[2 | 1]
[3 | 2]
[4 | 2]
</code></pre>

<p>In other words:</p>

<pre><code>Department 1
     |__Department 2
             |___Department 3
             |___Department 4
</code></pre>

<p>And so on...</p>

<p>This will improve the number of records required on the table and the Data can be accessed using a <strong><a href=""http://psoug.org/reference/connectby.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CONNECT BY</a></strong> command, just having 1 recor per department. We usually go for this tree structure as solution, but in this new application performance is a critical, so I was wondering what if I have a flattened-out table that would look like this.</p>

<pre><code>[1 | 0]
[2 | 1]
[3 | 1]
[3 | 2]
[4 | 1]
[4 | 2]
</code></pre>

<p>This allows you to have very obvious relationships without having to know the parent Department for a given child to know who their upper hierarchy Departments are. But this increases the amount of data required since you need a record for each level a Department  is in, meaning that if a have a Department 15 levels below the top one we would require 15 records for it.
The Department is pretty big so this may end up being a huge table (about 2 million records). </p>

<p>Ok, so after the brief introduction, this is the question; Has someone actually tried this that could tell me what is faster/less expensive for the DB between this two options, the huge flat table or the small tree one?</p>
","Whats faster in Oracle? Small table with tree structure vs. Huge flat table","<sql><oracle-database><database-design><oracle10g><query-optimization>","2010-10-08 18:48:17","1762","3893455","4","<p>I would definitely go for the first option (hierarchical approach). I think it's better to model the data correctly than to just use a bad data model to gain performance. Since you are modeling a hierarchy here, it makes sense to store it that way in the DB.</p>

<p>If you want the best of both worlds, my recommendation would be to look at using a <a href=""http://www.databasejournal.com/features/oracle/article.php/2192071/Materialized-Views-in-Oracle.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">materialized view</a> to ""flatten"" the hierarchical data, then you are still storing the data properly, but you get the performance gains (if any) by using the materialized view.</p>

<p>There's almost always a way to follow a good data model and still find ways to get good performance. But <strong>a bad data model will cost you for years to come, and it takes great pain to correct it later</strong>.</p>

<p>However, even with the flattened approach, you have to consider that you are increasing the number of records dramatically, especially as you get to the leaf nodes in the tree, so I'd be surprised if having a flat hierarchy table (your second approach) would improve performance since there are many more records to process.</p>

"3895163","<p>I'm currently completely baffled by the problem I'm having. I'm writing a plug-in for another application that provides a public .NET API. I've created a class named <code>Room</code> and I am using a PropertyGrid to allow users to see and edit the properties of the <code>Room</code> instances. A few properties are restricted to a set of standard values. Thus I am using custom TypeDescriptors with <code>GetStandardValues()</code> overrides to get the property grid to show a drop down for those properties.</p>

<p>This was all working just fine. I was getting drop downs, and I could edit values no problem. Yet now for some reason when I select an <code>Room</code> the PropertyGrid shows the properties with the type descriptors as a black box.</p>

For example I tried the following.</p>

<p>I still got the same InvalidCastException. Yet it's stack trace reference the first line above where I initialize <code>string s</code>. In addtion, if I tried to set a breakpoint on this first line it was also not triggered.</p>

I have seen assembly version confusion particularly when the assembly is in the GAC, where it insist upon loading an older version of the assembly.</p>

"3895302","<p>I have a solution with quite a few different MasterPages / BasePages which all inherit from somewhere else. My problem is that I have a virtual string in BaseMaster, which is overridden by BaseManagement, but when I try to access this string I always get the base value</p>

<p>The point of inheriting masters and pages is obviously to avoid having duplicate code everywhere.</p>

<p>Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I ""need"" <code>protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)</code> at every master no matter  </p>

<p><br></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/bOO6s.png"" alt=""Base Classes""></p>

<p>So, here's an snippet from Base.Master.cs</p>

<pre><code>public abstract partial class BaseMaster : MasterPage, IRewritablePageElement
{
    public BasePage BasePage { get { return Page as BasePage; } }
    public BaseMaster Self { get { return (BaseMaster)this.Page.Master; } }
    public virtual string accessUri { get { return ""/""; } }
    public string AccessUri { get { return Self.accessUri; } }

    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        this.OnPageLoad(sender, e);
    }

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// If we want to do something on page load, we override the following method
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public virtual void OnPageLoad(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        SetCacheability();

        RedirectSiteDown();
        RedirectUnregisteredUsers();
        RedirectUnprivilegedUsers();

        if(!IsPostBack)
        {
            PopulateMenu();

            ...
</code></pre>

<p>As you already noticed, </p>

<pre><code>    public BaseMaster Self { get { return (BaseMaster)this.Page.Master; } }
    public virtual string accessUri { get { return ""/""; } }
    public string AccessUri { get { return Self.accessUri; } }
</code></pre>

<p>is as ugly as it gets, since it should just be</p>

<pre><code>    public virtual string AccessUri { get { return ""/""; } }
</code></pre>

<p>but the code somehow manages to get all the way down to a level where AccessUri is ""/"" even though it has been overriden with ""/a/"" somewhere at a higher level:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class BaseManagementMaster : BaseMaster
{
    public override string accessUri { get { return ""/a/""; } }

    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If not for the <code>Self</code> thingy, here AccessUri is still ""/"". which makes absolutely no sense.
Also, the fact that I have to re-declare Page_Load methods makes very little sense too.</p>

<p>Is there a clean way to do master page inheritance, is it even realistically possible?</p>

<p>The data model shows that the <code>Make</code> and <code>Model</code> entities each have a to-one relationship with <code>Car</code>. Therefore, there can be only one <code>Car</code> for each <code>Make</code> and only one <code>Car</code> for each <code>Model</code>. In other words, given that data model, Nissan can only make one <code>Car</code>. You probably want a to-many <code>cars</code> relationship in <code>Model</code> so that Nissan can make more than one <code>Car</code>. Same thing with <code>Make</code> so that there can be more than one <code>Car</code> with a given <code>Make</code>.</p>

<p>The way <code>NSManagedObject</code>s are inserted into the managed object context is incorrect. It should be done like this: </p>

<pre><code>Car *car = [NSEntityDescription
    insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@""Car""
    inManagedObjectContext:self.managedObjectContext];
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, your code shows that a new <code>Make</code> and <code>Model</code> entity are created for each <code>Car</code>. If you are starting with the name of a <code>Make</code>, you probably want to search the managed object context for a <code>Make</code> that has a matching name. If found, just set the <code>make</code> relationship of the new <code>Car</code> to the <code>Make</code> entity that is already in the context.

"3897396","<p>Is it possible to make a table row expand and collapse? Can anyone refer me to a script or an example? </p>

<p>I prefer jQuery if possible. I have a drawing concept I would like to achieve:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/w20pP.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>
","Can a table row expand and close?","<jquery><tablelayout>","2010-10-09 18:42:24","156171","3897808","6","<p>Yes, a table row can slide up and down, but it's ugly since it changes the shape of the table and makes everything jump. Instead, put an element in each <code>td</code>, something that makes sense like a <code>p</code> or <code>h2</code> etc.</p>
<p>As for implementing a table slide toggle...</p>
<p>It's probably simplest to put the click handler on the entire table, <strong><a href=""http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>.stopPropagation()</code></a></strong> and <strong><a href=""http://api.jquery.com/event.target/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">check what was clicked</a></strong>.</p>
<p>If a td in a row with a colspan is clicked, close the <code>p</code> in it. If it's not a td in a row with a colspan, then close then toggle the following row's <code>p</code>.</p>
<p>It is essential to wrap all your written content in an element inside the <code>td</code>s, <strong>since you never want to <code>slideUp</code> a <code>td</code> or <code>tr</code></strong> or table shape will change!</p>
<p>Something like:</p>
<pre><code>$(function() {
  
      // Initially hide toggleable content
    $(&quot;td[colspan=3]&quot;).find(&quot;p&quot;).hide();

      // Click handler on entire table
    $(&quot;table&quot;).click(function(event) {

          // No bubbling up
        event.stopPropagation();

        var $target = $(event.target);

          // Open and close the appropriate thing
        if ( $target.closest(&quot;td&quot;).attr(&quot;colspan&quot;) &gt; 1 ) {
            $target.slideUp();
        } else {
            $target.closest(&quot;tr&quot;).next().find(&quot;p&quot;).slideToggle();
        }                    
    });

<p>The HTML just has to have alternating rows of several <code>td</code>s and then a row with a <code>td</code> of a colspan greater than 1. You can obviously adjust the specifics quite easily.</p>
<p>The HTML would look something like:</p>

"3897773","<p>I'm trying to create a scroll view that works like Apple's Pages app on the iPad.  See pic below.  I can create a similar scroll view with subviews containing the individuals pages, spaced apart as shown, and with pagingEnabled, it scrolls OK, but I want to achieve a scrolling effect that keeps the subviews centered once they've scrolled completely into view.  So I want each page to scroll to a centered position in the scrollview, but as the pagingEnabled behavior scrolls the entire bounds left or right, I end up with a partial page or pages showing.   What would be a good approach to this?</p>

By themselves, neither <code>p1</code> nor <code>Show</code> should give you trouble, which leads to the conclusion that it must be <code>p2[1,1]</code>.  This is born out by running that by itself, which generates the same error.  </p>

<p>This generates an error because of how <code>Plot</code>, <code>Plot3D</code>, etc evaluate the function argument.  In general, they essentially do a <code>Replace</code> on the text of the function and may not expand function calls. A simple fix is to rewrite <code>p2</code> as</p>

<pre><code>p2[x0_, y0_] := Plot3D[Evaluate[p[x, y, x0, y0]], {x, 0, 2}, {y, 0, 2}]
</code></pre>

<p>which gets rid of the errors.  <code>Evaluate</code> ensures that function is evaluated symbolically before <code>Plot3D</code> gets a hold of it avoiding any mishandling. I wish I had a better idea of when to use <code>Evaluate</code> in these cases, but if in general if you are getting errors from a plotting function like these, then it is most likely mishandling the function.</p>

"3899007","<p>Had a look over SO but I can't see any threads which address my problem.</p>

<p>I have a conceptual architecture, where there is a central server, which allows clients to connect to it via XML web services. There are 2 types of client, producers and consumers.</p>

<p>The system is built in C# using WCF WebServices, specifically IIS webservices (though this can be changed if necessary)</p>

<p>Producers publish information to the server, and consumers consume information uploaded by a producer.</p>

<p>The conundrum... Consumers need to somehow subscribe to an event on the server, which is thrown when a producer updates the web server, downloading new content and displaying it if necessary.</p>

<p>I don't want to use a polling mechanism, but can't see a way to subsribe to server events in a client.</p>

<p>Very basic architecture... Workstations could be the same PC running 2 services, or they could be 2 separate PC's on different networks. They don't about each other, so all comms are done through the webservice.</p>

"3899896","<p>One of my application is an engine that executes some complex calculations. These calculations may take several hours. I want to know the activity of this engine among time. </p>

<p>If you are using H<a href=""http://hudson-ci.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">udson CI server</a>, there is such a feature in <code>Administration &gt; Usages statistics</code> option. Here is an example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/PyuBT.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>In my application, I already have a function that returns the number of calculations. So my idea is to periodically call this method, for example every 10 minutes (using <a href=""http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Quartz</a>) in order to retrieve the number of running calculations and store it in a <code>int[]</code>. Every day, this <code>int[]</code> is stored in an external file, and cleaned. So after some days, the content of this file will look like:</p>

<pre><code>data.20101008=1;2;1;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;....;0
data.20101009=1;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;3;2;....;0
data.20101010=1;2;1;0;1;1;2;3;4;4;....;2
...
</code></pre>

<p>(I simplified a little this processing, as I want to update this file more frequently, in case of engine shutdown, or something like that)</p>

<p>To summarize, my idea is to store in a <code>properties</code> file the number of running calculations for a specific day. Eventually, I can provide a function that returns this data as a <code>Map&lt;Date, int[]&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Finally, I will use <a href=""http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JFreeChart</a> to display these data in a graphical </p>

<p>What do you think of this idea? Any advice to enhance this process?</p>

<p>Note that this functionality is one a <em>nice to have</em> feature, so I don't want to build too complex systems.</p>

"3899903","<p>I'm toying with a small game on my iPad using cocos2d and I've run into some performance worries. I have a 512x512 image tiled as my background. That gives me around 40fps with 20 sprites (in a <code>CCSpriteBatchNode</code>), the code for the background is this:</p>
<pre><code>CCSprite *background;
background = [CCSprite spriteWithFile:@&quot;oak.png&quot; rect : CGRectMake(0,
                                                                   0,

background.position =  ccp( size.width /2 , size.height/2 );
        
ccTexParams params = {GL_LINEAR,GL_LINEAR,GL_REPEAT,GL_REPEAT};
[background.texture setTexParameters: &amp;params];
</code></pre>
<p>If I remove the background I get a solid 60fps.</p>
<p>I've tried converting the image to PVRTC and that did give an extra fps or two. I get identical framerates using a 1024x768 image instead of the tiled version.</p>
<p>Since my background will remain axis aligned, unscaled and generally static. I figure there should be a faster way to draw it than having it as a regular <code>CCSprite</code>?</p>

(Even though it's outside the boundaries of the parent container, DOM-wise, it's still a child).  Alternatively, you could move the child node outside of the parent div inside your dragstop listener.  </p>

Been digging through the dev docs and can't find any plist specifier for a button, so I'm wondering if this is an internal API for the Apple guys?</p>

<p>After you hit the button, you get an action sheet asking you whether you really want to do it, and then presumably there is some callback based on the user's input.</p>

<p>Also noticed that the Nike + iPod settings have a clear button in them, but again, that app might have access to internal APIs that we don't.</p>

<p>The problem is, the images are being captured from the iPhone's camera so they are not exactly the same position. I need to create areas of a couple of pixels and extracting the general color of the area (maybe by adding up the RGBA values and dividing by the number of  pixels?). How could I do this and then translate it to a CGMask?</p>

"3901986","<p>another homework assignment here thats kind of unclear on the requirements. It is a forms program that assigns people to seats on an airplane. The part that is losing me is that its telling me to display the passenger manifest in a list box, but then its telling me to display it in a list box. Then it calls it a rich text box again. The screenshots provided with the assignment only show one display box. One of the events that is supposed to be included is a double click on an item in the manifest display. When the flight is closed, it tallies up your first class and business class passengers and displays that info in the same display box. </p>

<p>So my question is, was list box somehow incorporated into the rich text box? I thought maybe it was just overlayed, but later screenschots show the display box filled and scrolled down, as if it were all the same text box, rather than just a list box or rich text. I'm confused. Obviously, I'm not looking for anyone to do my work for me, but it doesn't appear this was covered in our material. Online class, so I don't get a lot of instructor feedback on stuff like this, unfortunately. Can anyone offer to shed any light on this?</p>

","Combining list boxes into rich text boxes?","<c#><winforms><listbox><richtextbox>","2010-10-10 20:09:11","982","3902174","2","<p>Both controls support a double click event. However, the big clue here is ""double click on an item in a list box."" The control you want is a list box.</p>

<p>There's no restraint on the text in a list box, except that it can't really wrap (unless you're using WPF, in which case all bets are off). In both snapshots, the text is narrow enough that there's no horizontal scrollbar.</p>

<p>So the text you're seeing in the second example is just ListBox items that happen to look like they could have been rendered in a RichTextBox control using a Courier font. Notice the vertical scrollbar in that snapshot. It's because the ListBox has more items in it than the ListBox in the snapshot on the left.</p>

<p>Short answer: The mention of RichTextBox is, likely, a typographical error. But you'd do well to ask your instructor to clarify.</p>

"3903011","<p>I'm having quite a bit of trouble trying to get inheritance to work in EF4. The original model is quite large, however I have managed to replicate it in a model of just two entities.</p>

<p>Essentially the two tables are ""Asset"" and ""Questionnaire"". Questionnaire inherits Asset (i.e. Questionnaire is an Asset). They do this by Questionnaire having an AssetID linking back to the Asset. Technically the design may not be the best however I'm trying to make this work for a 10 year old database without any major redesigns...</p>

<p>So given that, the tables are:</p>

<p><strong>Asset</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>AssetID uniqueidentifier NOT NULL - the primary key of this table</li>
<li>Other irrelevant columns</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Content_Questionnaire</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Id uniqueidentifier NOT NULL - the primary key of this table</li>
<li>AssetID uniqueidentifier NOT NULL - foreign key to Asset.AssetID</li>
<li>Other irrelevant columns</li>
</ul>

<p>The model for this is extremely simplistic - essentially it is:</p>

","EF4 Inheritance issues using Table per Type","<c#><entity-framework><entity-framework-4>","2010-10-11 01:32:05","1320","3904046","1","<p>Ok, there are a few things that you need to fix in your model:</p>

<p>1.First, you need to change the primary key on your Content_Questionnaire table to be AssetID, as far as I know, EF does support inheritance between 2 entity only if the association is on Primary Keys on both end. So it should be look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;EntityType Name=""Content_Questionnaire"">
    &lt;Key>
        &lt;!--First Change:-->
        &lt;PropertyRef Name=""AssetID"" />
    &lt;/Key>
    &lt;Property Name=""Id"" Type=""uniqueidentifier"" Nullable=""false"" />
    &lt;Property Name=""AssetID"" Type=""uniqueidentifier"" Nullable=""false"" />
&lt;/EntityType>
</code></pre>

<p>2.The Multiplicity on the Derived entity must be 0..1 (right now it's *) </p>

<pre><code>&lt;Association Name=""FK_Content_Questionnaire_Asset"">
  &lt;End Role=""Asset"" Type=""SnapServerModel.Store.Asset"" Multiplicity=""1"" />
  &lt;!--Secound Change:-->
  &lt;End Role=""Content_Questionnaire"" 
Type=""SnapServerModel.Store.Content_Questionnaire"" Multiplicity=""0..1"" />
  &lt;ReferentialConstraint>
    &lt;Principal Role=""Asset"">
      &lt;PropertyRef Name=""AssetID"" />
    &lt;/Principal>
    &lt;Dependent Role=""Content_Questionnaire"">
      &lt;PropertyRef Name=""AssetID"" />
    &lt;/Dependent>
  &lt;/ReferentialConstraint>
&lt;/Association>
</code></pre>

<p>3.Also, on your Model surface, just select the association line between the two entities and remove it (your navigation properties will be gone), by having inheritance, you don't need that.
<br><br>
Now, try to build your project again, you'll see that the compilation errors are gone.</p>

All you have is a bunch of resources that are identified by two parameters: Name and resource type.<br />The icon resource you see is of type ""ICON"" and is named ""MAINICON"" and is just an icon file. And icon files allow multiple images to be part of a single resource file. So what you're seeing is not the structure of the resource but the structure of the icon file as a <em>special</em> resource. The resource explorer is just capable of detecting these special resource files and thus displays them in this special way.<br />So basically, you have a main icon which only contains an icon of 32x32 pixels x32-bits colors. If you'd used an icon file that contains multiple images, you would have seen more in that list.</p>

<p><strong>1D array</strong>: You can do this very easily by</p>

<pre><code>const int MAX_SIZE=128;
int *arr1D = new int[MAX_SIZE];
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we are creating an int-pointer which will point to a chunk of memory where integers can be stored. </p>

<p><strong>2D array</strong>: You may use the solution of above 1D array to create a 2D array. First, create a pointer which should point to a memory block where only other integer pointers are held which ultimately point to actual data. Since our first pointer points to an array of pointers so this will be called as pointer-to-pointer (double pointer).</p>

<pre><code>const int HEIGHT=20;
const int WIDTH=20;

int **arr2D = new int*[WIDTH];  //create an array of int pointers (int*), that will point to 
                                //data as described in 1D array.
for(int i = 0;i &lt; WIDTH; i++){
      arr2D[i] = new int[HEIGHT]; 
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>3D Array</strong>: This is what you want to do. Here you may try both the scheme used in above two cases. Apply the same logic as 2D array. Diagram in question explains all. The first array will be pointer-to-pointer-to-pointer (int*** - since it points to double pointers). The solution is as below:</p>

<pre><code>const int X=20;
const int Y=20;
const int z=20;

int ***arr3D = new int**[X];
for(int i =0; i&lt;X; i++){
   arr3D[i] = new int*[Y];
   for(int j =0; j&lt;Y; j++){
       arr3D[i][j] = new int[Z];
       for(int k = 0; k&lt;Z;k++){
          arr3D[i][j][k] = 0;

   }

"3904768","<p>maybe some of you know that there are GPS tools out there that are used in Motorsports. A lot of them deliver the following function: If you drive with your car and you press a button at a certain point this GPS Coordinate will be stored and every time you drive over this coordinate a LapTime will be stored. For a small application a need a similar function. But here is my problem: Since you will never hit the exact Coordinate twice these tools store the coordinates of a Line and if you hit one of the coordinates of this line the Lap is finished. How do I calculate such a line? If you look at my Picture, the red dot is the coordinate where the user hits the button to start a lap and the green Line is what the device stores and uses as a virtual finish line and not only the Coordinate where the red dot is. Any Idea how I can calculate such a line? I really don't get it since the line is never ideal directed to north or south.

<p>You cannot merge multiple changesets in one go, unless the changesets are in sequence.</p>

<p>Using the <code>tf</code> command line tool you specify a range of versions by separating the version with a tilde character.</p>

<pre><code>tf merge /recursive /version:C162489~C162990 ""$/SourceBranch"" ""$/TargetBranch""

<p>In this case the changes 162987 and 162967 will also be included.</p>

<p>If you are using the UI in Visual Studio then the merge dialog will prevent you to select multiple individual changesets unless they are in sequence.</p>

<p>To merge two separate changesets into another branch you will have to do it in two steps:<br>
merge 162489 and then 162990 (start with merging the oldest changeset in case both changesets contain changes to the same files).</p>

<p>Then your workspace for the target branch will contain the changes for both changesets and now you can check-in the merges as one changeset in the target branch.</p>

    belongsTo User
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can just query the ProfileMessage and it should show all of the child ProfileReply objects as if they came from a separate related table. Basically a single level tree structure relates the entries to their parent entries in the same table.</p>

Only the largest margin between the bottom of the first element and the top of the second is taken into account.</p>
<p>It is quite normal to don't have too much space between two paragraphs eg.</p>
<p><strike>You cannot avoid that with two adjacent elements so you have to enlarge or reduce the larger margin.</strike></p>
<p>EDIT: cf. <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/box.html#collapsing-margins"" rel=""noreferrer"">W3C</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two margins are adjoining if and only if:</p>
<ul>
<li>both belong to in-flow block-level boxes that participate in the same block formatting context</li>
<li>no line boxes, no clearance, no padding and no border separate them</li>
<li>both belong to vertically-adjacent box edges</li>

"3906730","<p>Can you please tell me How can I get Control back from NSOperationQueue</p>

<p>Following is my real question which I asked earlier:</p>

<p>Hi friends , I made an app which plays the song on clicking on the image of artist.(see image attached). Each artist image is implemented on button and on clicking this button, a function is being called which first downloads and then plays the song. I passed this method(function) in a thread but problem is that every time when I click on the image of artist(button) new threads starts running and then multiple songs gets started playing concurrently. How can I use ""NSOperation and NSOperationQueue"" so that only one song will run at a time . Please help.</p>

It doesn't have to be bound 1:1 to a view controller, but if it's not, you need to set up the custom single view controller that owns the screen, and then get it to own all three table views as subviews. You need to be careful about which object is the delegate and data source of each views, and do the right thing with providing cells, etc. If the same controller is the delegate/data source of all the table views, you have to switch in the delegate methods to do the right thing on each.</p>

<p>You have a DataSource defined with a parameterized query that contains two parameters: </p>

<p>@CategoryID
@UserID</p>

<p>However, you appear to only be populating one of the parameters via the Control Parameters.</p>

<p>
  
</p>

<p>Fixing this should be easy enough as you are already pulling the UserID from a query string variable in your other DataSource. You should be able to just copy the QueryStringParameter into your list of SelectParameters for your photo DataSource. Highlighted below:</p>

<p>
  
  
</p>

<p>You could also handle the Selecting event of the datasource and programatically set the UserID in the query that way, but the aforementioned option is easiest. I just want you to be aware of all your options.</p>

<p>Here is the code for that last column</p>

<pre><code>&lt;g:form&gt;
    &lt;g:hiddenField name=""id"" value=""${densityInstance?.id}"" /&gt;
    &lt;g:actionSubmit class=""editar"" action=""update"" value=""${message(code: 'default.button.editar.label', default: '&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;')}"" /&gt;
    &lt;g:actionSubmit class=""eliminar"" action=""delete"" value=""${message(code: 'default.button.eliminar.label', default: '&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;')}"" onclick=""return confirm('${message(code: 'default.button.delete.confirm.message', default: 'Are you sure you want to delete?')}');"" /&gt;
&lt;/g:form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here is what I have for the delete and update in the controller</p>

<pre><code>def delete = {
    def densityInstance = Density.get(params.id)
    if (densityInstance) {
        try {
            densityInstance.delete(flush: true)
            flash.message = ""${message(code: 'default.deleted.message', args: [message(code: 'density.label', default: 'Density'), params.id])}""
            redirect(action: ""list"")
        }
        catch (org.springframework.dao.DataIntegrityViolationException e) {
            flash.message = ""${message(code: 'default.not.deleted.message', args: [message(code: 'density.label', default: 'Density'), params.id])}""

    }
    else {

        redirect(action: ""list"")
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The DELETE seems to be working fine, and here is the UPDATE, (maybe is the SAVE def that I need to edit, I'm not so sure and that's why I'm asking.</p>

<p>Here is the UPDATE:</p>

<pre><code>def update = {
    def densityInstance = Density.get(params.id)
    if (densityInstance) {
        if (params.version) {
            def version = params.version.toLong()
            if (densityInstance.version &gt; version) {

                densityInstance.errors.rejectValue(""version"", ""default.optimistic.locking.failure"", [message(code: 'density.label', default: 'Density')] as Object[], ""Another user has updated this Density while you were editing"")
                render(view: ""list"", model: [densityInstance: densityInstance])
                return
            }
        }
        densityInstance.properties = params
        if (!densityInstance.hasErrors() &amp;&amp; densityInstance.save(flush: true)) {
            flash.message = ""${message(code: 'default.updated.message', args: [message(code: 'density.label', default: 'Density'), densityInstance.id])}""

It has the advantage that you can search over original messages and responses with a single query.</p>

<p>The set of original messages can be found where pid = selfid and the responses where pid &lt;> selfid.  If it's important to be able to see the original and response messages separately (without knowledge of the storage mechanism) you can encapsulate the above conditions in two VIEWs: OriginalMessages and Responses.</p>

<p>If the originals and responses have different attributes (for instance, if you want the original to allow links to URLs, photos, etc) you might consider using two separate tables.  But even there, I'd probably argue for the one table structure with a separate, extender table for the additional attributes.  That means you don't have to store often-empty columns for those original messages that don't use the extended attributes, and you can later easily add the extended attributes to the response messages as well (if desired).</p>

<p>I've solved this by sticking the necessary parameter value in each ViewModel and then passing the value onto a partial to render the links; this feels kludgey.

I'll walk you through my solution hopefully I understood the question correctly and some of this helps.</p>

<p>As far as getting data to and from the View, I do use the ViewDataDictionary.  To the best of my knowledge, that's what it's for when your model doesn't consist of a single simple object.  In order to get around the ""magic strings"" of view keys, I create a bunch of extension methods on the ViewDataDictionary.  This has the drawback that you end up with a slew of extra methods, but at least all of your string keys are isolated in a single location.  You could even go the extra step of create constants in the class, but it seems redundant when only this class uses them.  Extension properties would be better but...</p>

    IList&lt;TabItemDisplay&gt; result;

        result = dictionary[""TabList""] as IList&lt;TabItemDisplay&gt;;

    dictionary[""TabList""] = tabList;
    return tabList;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You'll notice that I have an explicit view object, TabItemDisplay, that I pass into the dictionary.  This contains all of the values necessary to pass to Html.ActionLink.</p>

<pre><code>public class TabItemDisplay
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Action { get; set; }
    public string Controller { get; set; }
    public object RouteValues { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since this view is not the main content of the page, I prefer to put the logic of creating the tab items, including destination parameters, into an ActionFilter.  This allows me to reuse the tab creation logic across different actions and controllers.  Any View that contains the tab partial control gets the CreatTabAttribute slapped across the corresponding Action or Controller and it's good to go.</p>

<p>This may be more than you needed, but I hope some of it helps.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Just realized I didn't include what this looks like in the partial view.  I actually have an HtmlHelper extension that renders a more intricate tab, but you get the idea.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Control Language=""C#"" Inherits=""System.Web.Mvc.ViewUserControl"" %&gt;
&lt;div id=""tabs""&gt;

%&gt;
    &lt;%= Html.ActionLink(item.Name, item.Action, item.Controller, item.RouteValues, null)%&gt;
&lt;%      
        }
    }
%&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

"3910150","<p>I'm currently trying to debug a problem in Flex 4, in where a component is firing a custom event with its local coordinates translated to global coordinates (i.e. localToGlobal) and another component (in a separate ""branch"" of the display list hierarchy) recieves such event and uses it as a part of an animation, via globalToLocal.  It should be a simple, coordinate-transformation system but it is not working.</p>

<p>I'm trying to debug this, by using AS3's drawing API to draw circles where the Points should be.</p>

<p>Here is the dispatching component (Component A in the image below):</p>

<pre><code>// Check where is the local x,y
this.graphics.beginFill(0x0000FF);
this.graphics.drawCircle(this.x,this.y, 10);

// Draw another circle in the ""global"" coordinates.
// pGC = Point in Global Coordinates.
var p: Point = new Point ( this.x, this.y);
var pGC:Point = Application(FlexGlobals.topLevelApplication).globalToLocal(p);
Application(FlexGlobals.topLevelApplication).graphics.beginFill( 0xFF0000)
Application(FlexGlobals.topLevelApplication).graphics.drawCircle(pGC.x,pGC.y,50);

// Dispatch the event
dispatchEvent( new ComponentLocationEvent( this.localToGlobal(this.x,this.y) );
</code></pre>

<p>Here is the ""listening"" component (component B in the image below):</p>

<pre><code>private var value_x:int;
private var value_y:int;

private function onComponentLocationData( pointInGlobalCoordinates:Point):void
{
  var pointLocalCoord:Point = this.childContainer.globalToContent( 
          pointInGlobalCoordinates);
  this.value_x = pointLocalCoord.x;
  this.value_y = pointLocalCoord.y;

  // More debugging circles
  this.graphics.beginFill(0x00FF00, 0.5);
  this.graphics.drawCircle(pointLocalCoord.x,pointLocalCoord.y);
}
</code></pre>

<p>One would expect the three circles (Red, Green and Blue) to correspond, each being drawn just before the event dispatch and one (green) on event listening.  What actually happens is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blue circle is drawn where you would expect it.</li>
<li>Red circle is never drawn (hence, my question on drawing on the stage in Flex 4)</li>
<li>Green circle is drawn in an un-expected place.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does anyone has any clue on what could I try here?  This was my approach to debug this error, feel free to point out what I am doing wrong.</p>

You can try it by yourself. Position of circle within a component depends on components location within it's container.</p>

<pre><code>package components
{
    import mx.controls.Button;
    public class ComponentA extends Button
    {
        public function ComponentA()
        {
            super();
        }

        override protected function updateDisplayList(unscaledWidth:Number, unscaledHeight:Number):void
        {
            super.updateDisplayList(unscaledWidth, unscaledHeight);
            this.graphics.beginFill(0x0000FF);
            this.graphics.drawCircle(this.x,this.y, 10);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Second,
var pGC:Point = Application(FlexGlobals.topLevelApplication).globalToLocal(p);
should have no effect in translating coordinates (I didn't test it but it should be so)
Otherwise what are global coordinates if not application level coordinates...</p>

<p>And in listener code what is childContainer you are using to translate coordinates?</p>

"3912131","<p>I'm looking for a step-by-step explanation on how to go from the normal folder structure on the left where the <code>application</code> folder contains <code>models,views,controllers</code>, to the module-based folder structure on the right where <code>application</code> contains a <code>modules</code> folder which contains the individual modules with their own <code>models,views,controllers</code>. </p>

<p>I say ""conversion"" because I don't think zend lets us create projects using the module architecture from the start, but if it did, that would be swell and would remove the need to make these folder structure changes manually. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/3D8TA.jpg"" alt=""http://img375.imageshack.us/img375/5582/foldersboth.jpg""></p>

<p><strong>Here's my experience so far</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>When I create a module <code>zf create module product</code>, the modules folder is generated and a folder <code>product</code> is generated inside it and the <code>views,controllers,models</code> for that module are also generated. </p></li>
<li><p>But I also need to move the main <code>views,controllers,models</code> to a <code>modules/default</code> folder of their own. If I create that folder manually and move the main <code>views,models,controllers</code> there, I get a bug when trying to add new controllers to that <code>default</code> module. The bug is that it <strong>re-generates</strong> the main (now missing) <code>views,controllers,models</code> in <code>application</code> and inserts that new controller in <code>application/controllers/newcont</code> because it doesn't recognize that the default controllers folder has been moved manually to <code>application/modules/default/controllers/</code>. </p></li>
<li><p>So my solution to that has been to <code>zf create module default</code> then copy the main <code>views,models,controllers</code> there. It ends up looking the same but somehow the <code>zf create module</code> method makes a difference. When I do it this way, new controllers get added correctly into <code>application/modules/default/controllers</code> and not <code>application/controllers</code></p></li>
</ul>

<p>Half the problem solved. But when I try to view the application, I don't see anything from <code>index/index</code> view. I don't get any errors either, but I see nothing. I suspect that it's because the application doesn't know that the <code>index/index</code> view has moved.</p>

<ul>
<li>This used to be located at <code>application/views/scripts/index/index.phtml</code> </li>
<li>but is now located at <code>application/modules/default/views/scripts/index/index.phtml</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I'm guessing I need to make changes to application.ini or to bootstrap.php or some other location. So what exactly are the steps to get this thing done smoothly and get it working? I'm using the latest ZF 1.10.8. Please start from create a new zend project so there's no confusion on the exact steps.</p>
","Step-by-step conversion to module-based folder structure for zend project","<php><zend-framework><zend-view>","2010-10-12 06:24:35","3436","3919514","2","<p>Here's what I did to try and follow your example (from scratch):</p>

<pre><code>$ zf create project .
$ zf create module product
$ zf create module default
</code></pre>

<p>I then moved <code>controllers</code>, <code>models</code> and <code>views</code> from <code>./application</code> to <code>./application/modules</code>.</p>

<p>Next I opened up application.ini, and <strong>replaced</strong> this line (which tells ZF where to find controllers in a non-modular app):</p>

<pre><code>resources.frontController.controllerDirectory = APPLICATION_PATH ""/controllers""
</code></pre>

<p>with:</p>

<pre><code>resources.frontController.moduleDirectory = APPLICATION_PATH ""/modules""
</code></pre>

<p>which tells ZF where to find modules.</p>

<p>I then manually created an index controller for the product module so I could test that this worked, which it did. I then hit <a href=""http://localhost/index/index"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://localhost/index/index</a> to see if the default module index action still worked, it didn't, instead I got the error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Exception' with message 'Invalid controller class (""Default_ErrorController"")' in ...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>it sounds like this is where you got to. </p>

<p>There are two ways to fix this error, and the documentation is quite misleading (possibly even wrong). It <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.modular.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">states</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that in the default module, controllers do not need a namespace prefix. Thus, in the example above, the controllers in the default module do not need a prefix of 'Default_' -- they are simply dispatched according to their base controller name: 'IndexController' and 'FooController'. A namespace prefix is used in all other modules, however. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>but clearly the error above indicates that ZF is looking for an ErrorController class called Default_ErrorController. To fix this you can do one of two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change the class names of application/modules/default/controllers/IndexController.php from <code>IndexController</code> to <code>Default_IndexController</code>, and application/modules/default/controllers/ErrorController.php from <code>ErrorController</code> to <code>Default_ErrorController</code></li>
<li><p>Or remove this line:</p>

<p>resources.frontController.params.prefixDefaultModule = ""1""</p></li>
</ul>

<p>from application.ini. This line tells ZF to use the 'Default_' namespace on the default module classes, so without it it will just look for 'IndexController'. I went for the latter option, and <a href=""http://localhost/index/index"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://localhost/index/index</a> then worked as expected.</p>

<p>In your case you said you got a blank page at /index/index, which means either:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have a different problem</li>
<li>You have errors disabled in development mode</li>
<li>You are running in production mode where errors are disabled by default (most likely)</li>
</ul>

<p>to check the last option, open application.ini and <em>temporarily</em> change <code>phpSettings.display_errors</code> from 0 to 1 in the production section. If you then get the same error I had above, hopefully you'll be able to get everything working.</p>

<p>I hope this is helpful. All I can say is don't get too reliant on Zend_Tool for management of your app - it can't do everything, and often it's easier to manually move things around than to try and do everything via. the zf command; particularly when restructuring.</p>

<p>In your generator.yml, on the <code>display</code> line, Symfony (via Doctrine) will look for a field name in your model class that corresponds to each field you want to display.  If the field name doesn't exist, it will then look for a corresponding <code>getFieldName()</code> method and call that.</p>

<p>In your example, you have <code>Type</code> as a field name, which will be calling <code>getType()</code> - this will fetch the relation in.  By default, Doctrine assumes that when you want to convert a model to a string (eg for display in your list), you want to use the primary key - in your case, the ID value.</p>

<p>To overcome this, add a <code>__toString()</code> method as follows, to your Doctrine <code>lib/model/doctrine/EcType.class.php</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>class EcType extends BaseEcType
{
  public function __toString()
  {
    return $this-&gt;type;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and you should see the 'type' field being displayed in your admin generated list.</p>

Alternative would be to create your own framework exactly same to that of Apple's but that will not be nice thing to do as Apple will certainly come up with upgrades and fixes in future that will resolve the issues.</p>

<p>The only solution would be to report bugs to Apple about memory leaks, even I have seen that framework has lots of memory leaks.</p>

<p>There are also other reasons for memory leaks, instruments may show memory leaks in apple's framework, but it is not necessary that it is caused by the framework's bad code, indeed it could be the bug in our code where we did not follow correct steps, for example we add observers but we do not remove them, we bind for events but we do not remove them, so if we have not done cleaning operations correctly, instruments may show leak but somewhere else.</p>

"3914842","<p>Consider the following graph:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/cperR.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I'm trying to find a way to enumerate all possible paths from a source node to a target node. For example, from A to E, we have the following possible paths:</p>

<pre><code>A B C D E
A B C E
A C D E
A C E
</code></pre>

<p>Note that for A C D E, there are actually 2 paths, since one of the paths uses edge F3 and the other uses edge F5. Also, since there's a cycle between A and C, you could end up with an infinite number of paths, but for the purposes of this I'm only interested in paths in which no node is repeated on the path from source to target.</p>

<p>I wrote a depth first search (DFS) algorithm, but the problem is that when you have multiple edges between 2 nodes (like edges F3 and F5 above) I'm not sure how to handle it. My algorithm only brings back paths <code>A C D E</code> and <code>A C E</code>, not the other paths. In the case of <code>A B C E</code>, I understand the reason, because it starts at A and then goes to C and builds those paths, but when the DFS gets back to node B, it then tries to go to C, but C has already been visited so it stops.</p>

<p>Anyway, I just wondered if there was a way to do this, or maybe this is NP-complete. </p>

<p>In case you'd like to see my DFS, code is below (sorry for the macro abuse, I use these in contest programming so it's a bit of a habit).</p>

I don't believe you can output <code>n!</code> possible paths in polynomial time. And that's how may you get if each node is connected to each other node.</p>

<p><em>but the problem is that when you have multiple edges between 2 nodes (like edges F3 and F5 above)</em><br>

"3915092","<p>My schema looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/e7cAN.png"" alt=""database schema diagram""></p>

<p>The Message.Id column is an identity(1,1), and the MessageHeader table uses a composite key consisting of the associated message ID, and a header name field that uniquely identifies a header within each message.</p>

<p>Entities are represented in code as:</p>

<pre><code>public class Message {
    public virtual int Id { get; set; }
    public virtual string Sender { get; set; }
    public virtual string Recipient { get; set; }
    private IList&lt;MessageHeader&gt; headers = new List&lt;MessageHeader&gt;();

    public virtual IList&lt;MessageHeader&gt; Headers { 
        get { return headers; } 
        set { headers = value; }
    }

    public virtual void SetHeader(string headerName, string headerText) {
        MessageHeader header = this.Headers.FirstOrDefault(h =&gt; h.HeaderName == headerName);
        if (header == default(MessageHeader)) {
            header = new MessageHeader() {
                HeaderName = headerName,
                Message = this
            };
            this.Headers.Add(header);
            header.HeaderText = headerText;
        }
    }
}

public class MessageHeader {
    public virtual Message Message { get; set; }
    public virtual string HeaderName { get; set; }
    public virtual string HeaderText { get; set; }
    public virtual byte[] Version { get; set; }

    public override bool Equals(object obj) {
        if (Object.Equals(this, obj)) return (true);
        var that = obj as MessageHeader;
        if (that == null) return (false);
        return (this.HeaderName == that.HeaderName &amp;&amp; this.Message.Equals(that.Message));
    }

    public override int GetHashCode() {
        return (this.HeaderName.GetHashCode() ^ this.Message.GetHashCode());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want to map these entities using Fluent NHibernate so that when I run code like:</p>

<pre><code>var message = new Message() { Sender = ""alf"", Recipient = ""bob"" };
message.SetHeader(""DateSent"", DateTime.Now.ToString());

using (var session = NHibernateHelper.GetCurrentSession()) {
   using(var tx = session.BeginTransaction()) {
     session.Save(message);
     tx.Commit();
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>NHibernate will:</p>

<ol>
<li>INSERT the Message entity and retrieve the identity value.</li>
<li>INSERT the MessageHeader entity (with the appropriate MessageId retrieved in step 1)</li>
</ol>

<p>I cannot make this work. It either tries to insert the MessageHeader first (which fails with a foreign key violation), or it tries to UPDATE the MessageHeader instead of INSERTing it, which returns no rows and throws a ""could not synchronise database state with session"" error.</p>

<p>My FluentNH mapping overrides are as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public class MessageOverrides : IAutoMappingOverride&lt;Message&gt; {

    public void Override(AutoMapping&lt;Message&gt; map) {
        map.HasMany(message =&gt; message.Headers).KeyColumn(""MessageId"");
    }
}

public class MessageHeaderOverrides : IAutoMappingOverride&lt;MessageHeader&gt; {
    public void Override(AutoMapping&lt;MessageHeader&gt; map) {
        map.IgnoreProperty(header =&gt; header.Message);
        map.CompositeId()
            .KeyReference(header =&gt; header.Message, ""MessageId"")
            .KeyProperty(header =&gt; header.HeaderName);
        map.Version(header =&gt; header.Version)
            .CustomSqlType(""timestamp"").Nullable()
            .Generated.Always();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I thought adding the explicit Version timestamp to the MessageHeader table would resolve this, but it would appear not... I'm sure something needs to be Inverse or Cascade or something, but I am completely stumped as to what needs to go where.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Dylan</p>

<p>but it also turned out that a non-NH-related bug elsewhere in the code was preventing this from working properly. Fixed the bug, mapped it as shown above, and it worked. The Version property on the MessageHeader is nice-to-have but not required - if you omit it, NH will query the DB before an insert/update to find out which one is required.</p>

It's nothing more than giving a 3D recessed border to the control, and adding two labels (ON and OFF) and a disabled button and adding the code to move the button left or right on a click event.  You'd want to give the control the same interface as a CheckBox (i.e. with a ""Checked"" property).</p>

<p>Incidentally, I know this control is in the style of the iPhone, which makes it supposedly ""cool"", but from my perspective the main achievement here is that it takes up a <em>lot</em> more space than a checkbox, and fundamentally ties the control to English (unless you put in the extra work to replace ""ON"" and ""OFF"" with whatever else is needed for a particular language).</p>

<p>This control actually makes some sense on a phone, since it's easier to manipulate with the thumb than a checkbox is.  I don't think it's very valuable to have it in a Windows application (the Visual Studio designers obviously think otherwise).</p>

"3916229","<p>I have created a custom scrollable tabbar [scrollview with buttons over it] below navigationcontroller. I have two tabbars already in standard tabcontroller at the bottom. For the standard bottom tabs, I have created two navigationcontrollers in xib with two different nibs for both. I'm loading a tableview in one of the lower tabs which is common to one of the upper tabs which is having the navigationcontroller reference.</p>

<p>The issue is in the second upper tab I'm having a viewController but it's not having the navigationcontroller reference as I am not able to give its reference in my main.xib to the upper tab as that tab is not an actual tab with respect to the xib.</p>

<p>I tried giving the app delegate's navigationcontroller outlet reference to locally created navigationcontroller in that particular viewcontroller without the navigation reference. So the otherwise nil navigationcontroller reference isn't coming nil now and showing me the app delegate's navigationcontroller reference when logged, but I'm still not able to change its title or any of the barbuttons for that matter.</p>

<p>I want to know wheather it's really possible to have standard tabbar with different viewcontrollers as well as upper tabbar with its own different tabs and viewcontrollers along with navigation reference for each?</p>

<p>I have seen such app but in that case each of the upper tabs are having the same view for example tableview only different datasource for each tab which is possible as you already have a viewcontroller's reference in one of the lower tabs which you can keep common to all the upper tabs.</p>

<p>This is the screenshot of the setup.</p>

<p>Upper tabbar contains two tabs: Newsfeed and Top 1000 companies.
The tableview in Newsfeed is actually the nib file which is loaded inside lower tab Newsfeed. But the other upper tab ""Top 1000 companies""'s nib isn't loaded in this setup as the upper tabbar is just virtual. So in this setup I'm not able to give navigationcontroller's reference to the ""Top 1000 companies""'s viewcontroller.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/uOWoH.png"" alt=""outgoing""></p>

<p>I'm not asking about the base file icons, I know those (HTML file and Java source file). I'm asking about the right-pointing dark gray arrows, which are labeled ""outgoing."" What does that imply? Outgoing from the IDE to the repo, or outgoing from the repo to the IDE? Why are there minus signs inside the arrows? Sometimes, I see plus signs instead; other times, just empty arrows. What's the difference?</p>

<p>There are also left-pointing blue arrows and double-headed red arrows; what do those mean? What about cases when they contain other symbols, like <code>-</code> and <code>+</code>?</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>Note: This question has been edited pretty drastically. Normally I wouldn't change so much, but it had nearly no activity and was a dupe. The original question asked for an ""icon glossary"" that would explain all or most of Subclipse's icons, similar to <a href=""http://help.eclipse.org/galileo/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/ref-icons.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">this one for Eclipse</a>. I'd still love to know about one of those, but there just doesn't seem to be one out there.</p>

","What do the arrow icons in Subclipse mean?","<icons><subclipse>","2010-10-12 18:43:07","74373","3920248","1","<p>When working with the Subversion repository, remote changes (those on the repository) are incoming changes (remote &rarr; local), while local changes are outgoing changes (local &rarr; remote).</p>

<p>In views that compare the local and remote copies, incoming changes are denoted with a blue, left-facing arrow, while outgoing changes are denoted with a gray, right-facing arrow. These arrows may be decorated to indicate more specific operations.</p>

<p>The Package Explorer view, on the other hand, indicates a file's status with a different set of icons representing its local state. These icons are the ones most commonly seen, so let's start with them:</p>

<p><sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/uKpNO.png"" alt=""Ignored File""></sub> - A file ignored by version control. You can control what resources will be ignored by going to <em>Window &rarr; Preferences &rarr; Team &rarr; Ignored Resources</em>.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/UWf9X.png"" alt=""Unversioned File""></sub> - A file not under version control. These are typically new files that you have not committed to the repository yet.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/RMTXE.png"" alt=""New File""></sub> - A versioned file that needs to be added to the remote repository. These are typically files you have either renamed, or moved to a different directory.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/NS1OG.png"" alt=""Deleted File""></sub> - A deleted folder. These are folders that you have deleted locally without yet committing the changes to the repository. Note that files are usually removed from the view when they're deleted locally, so they are normally not seen with this icon.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/iee2g.png"" alt=""Synchronized File""></sub> - A file with no local changes.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/jS8wu.png"" alt=""Local Changes""></sub> - A file with local, uncommitted changes.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/kioVk.png"" alt=""Locked File""></sub> - A <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.advanced.locking.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">locked</a> file.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/x6p5N.png"" alt=""Needs Lock""></sub> - A file that needs a lock to be edited. These are typically files that cannot easily be merged (i.e. binary files), but may have many editors. A file needs a lock when its <code>svn:needs-lock</code> property is set, and Subversion will attempt to make these files read-only in the file system to enforce proper lock negotation.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/HyV5B.png"" alt=""Conflicted File""></sub> - A conflicted file. These are typically files that had a commit/update conflict that you marked to resolve later.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/m3v8P.png"" alt=""Tree Conflicted File""></sub> - A file that has a tree conflict. These are typically files that have local changes, but have since been moved, removed, or renamed in the repository since the last local copy update.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/tIRZZ.png"" alt=""External File""></sub> - A file that is external to the project. Linked external files cannot be committed to the repository.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/QhHYs.png"" alt=""Switched File""></sub> <sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/K4NCr.jpg"" alt=""Switched File 2""></sub> - A file that has been <a href=""http://svn.haxx.se/subusers/archive-2007-06/0052.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer"">switched</a>. These are files which belongs to a different working copy than their local parent directory.</p>

<p>In a synchronization view (e.g. via <em>Synchronize with Repository</em> or <em>Commit</em>), as previously described, there are icons which indicate which direction a change is occurring in as well as additional information about that change. These are described below:</p>

<p><strong>Outgoing</strong><br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/BGt41.png"" alt=""Commit Changes""></sub> - A file whose contents have been modified and will be committed to the repository.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/RO2hZ.png"" alt=""Commit Addition""></sub> - A file that will be newly added to the repository. This may coincide with a file removal in cases where a file is moved or renamed..<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/01aZm.png"" alt=""Commit Removal""></sub> - A file that will be removed from the repository. This may coincide with a file addition in cases where a file is moved or renamed.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/CeV6D.png"" alt=""Property Change""></sub> - A file with <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.props.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">property changes</a>, in the Commit dialog. On the Synchronize tab, property changes are currently reflected as a normal file modification (<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/BGt41.png"" alt=""Commit Changes""></sub>).</p>

<p><strong>Incoming</strong><br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/3XXOX.png"" alt=""Remote Changes""></sub> - A file that has content changes committed to the repository that will be applied to the local copy.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/PVH4L.png"" alt=""Pull Addition""></sub> - A new file that will be added to the local copy from the repository. Like the outgoing file addition, this may be the result of a move or rename.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/OJme5.png"" alt=""Pull Removal""></sub> - A file that will be removed from the local copy because it has been removed from the repository. Like the outgoing file removal, this may be the result of a move or rename.</p>

<p><strong>Conflict</strong><br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/9wrQQ.png"" alt=""Conflicting Versions""></sub> - A file that has been changed in both the local copy and repository independently, causing a need for conflict resolution. Fixing this condition involves opening up the conflict view or forcibly overwriting changes locally or remotely.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/KwULa.png"" alt=""Synchronization Tree Conflict""></sub> - A file that has a <a href=""http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.tour.treeconflicts.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">tree conflict</a>. This can occur when there are new changes to a file on one end (either local or remote), and the file is moved, removed, or renamed on the other. </p>

<p>Finally, the <em>Synchronize with Repository</em> option opens the Synchronize tab (<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/lPBhk.png"" alt=""Synchronize Tab""></sub>) with the following buttons:</p>

<p><sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/zY07z.png"" alt=""Synchronize Source""></sub> - Synchronizes the local copy with the currently selected repository when clicked. Selecting from the drop-down allows switching between different remote code bases.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Inal5.png"" alt=""Show Incoming""></sub> - Shows only incoming changes (remote &rarr; local).<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/PKM5L.png"" alt=""Show Outgoing""></sub> - Shows only outgoing changes (local &rarr; remote).<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/bdp8P.png"" alt=""Show Incoming and Outgoing""></sub> - Shows both incoming and outgoing changes (remote &harr; local).<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/EyWVU.png"" alt=""Show Conflicts""></sub> - Shows conflicting changes.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/brjg1.png"" alt=""Update Incoming""></sub> - Updates all local resources with incoming changes after prompt.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/e42Oa.png"" alt=""Commit Outgoing""></sub> - Brings up the commit dialog to commit all outgoing changes.<br>
<sub><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/nhsqV.png"" alt=""Show Changesets""></sub> - Breaks up the change lists by revisions.</p>

<p>There are a few other views which weren't covered that have additional icons, but this should hopefully be a good start. Let me know if there is anything important missing, or any of these descriptions seem to differ from your actual experience.</p>

<p>You have a CMS where an user is able to determine what content will be displayed.
The content consists of multiple colums with links underneath them. It looks something like this:</p>

<p><strong>Column name</strong><br>
link1 link2 link3 link4<br>
link5 link6 liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiink7<br>
link8 liiiink9 liiiiiiink10<br>

<strong>Column name2</strong><br>

<strong>Column name3</strong><br>
link1 link2 link3 link4<br>
link5 link6 liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiink7<br>

<p><strong>Column name4</strong><br>
link1 link2 link3 link4<br>
link5 link6 liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiink7<br>
link8 liiiink9 liiiiiiink10<br></p>

<p>When this list gets too long the content will be split over 2 columns.
Right now content will just be split -> in mozilla using css3 and in IE using a JQuery library in which something similar is done.</p>

<h3>CSS</h3>

<pre><code>.columns {
 -moz-column-count: 2;
 -moz-column-gap: 30px;
 -webkit-column-count: 2;
 -webkit-column-gap: 30px;

  jQuery('#MultiColumn').columnize({
   columns: 2,
   buildOnce: true
  })
 }
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;![endif]--&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you see this is handled client side, and the effect of doing this is that text will just be split without making sure columns won't be just broken apart.</p>

<p>This is the effect:<br>
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/z6sm9.png"" alt=""Columns error""></p>

<p>So this is now solved client side and therefore the content will just be broken and split over 2 columns.
Is there any good way to solve this server side having 2 nice columns with some logic to determine wheter the columns have the similar height?
How would you solve this issue?</p>

<p>You can get the current attribute in jQuery 1.4+ with a simple <code>alert($.expando)</code>, for an example of how it's used, say you wanted the data for that <code>#wmd-preview</code> element, doing this:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#wmd-preview"").data()

<p>X is a normal <code>DependencyProperty</code> and buttons do their work without problem and TextBlock's content inside border1 shows the changed value.</p>

<p>Now the <strong>problem</strong> is Height can be only <em>Increased</em>! For example by pressing 1, Height increases to 100, pressing 3 increases it to 300 <strong>but</strong> pressing 2 does not change the height.</p>

<p>If I set the initial border1's height to, for example, 400, all buttons can decrease it to 100, 200 or 300 but after this stage no animation can decrease border's height.</p>

<p>Am I missing some obvious point regarding WPF animation?</p>

<p>Part of the issue is the storyboard in the DataTrigger is not being stopped, so (the last DataTrigger defined) is always holding the Height's 'animated' value.</p>

<p>Adding a StopStoryboard in the exit action fixes part of it. You can now switch between all three heights again... but the animation always starts from the Height's base value (which is clearly not what you want). You want it to start from where it was last set at.</p>

"3928208","<p>I recently (today, actually) got some new permissions to some MS SQL Server tables (of SAP software), but I'm getting permissions issues with importing them.  Here's how my process looks right now:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have an Access database that links to SAP tables via an ODBC connection.</li>
<li>In that same Access database, a set of spaghetti-like queries pulls &amp; refines a modest data set (a dozen columns, few hundred rows, nothing special). I can run these queries without a problem.</li>
<li>An Excel file imports that data using <strong>Data-&gt;Import External Data-&gt;Import Data</strong>.  I do this all the time.  Except this time, I'm getting the dialog pictured below. Clicking <strong>OK</strong> doesn't seem to do anything.  Clicking <strong>Cancel</strong> produces an &quot;ODBC Connection Failure&quot; message (or something like that).</li>
</ol>
<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/DYR1l.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>
<p>Again, these queries can be run from Access just fine.  But when I import those query results into Excel, I get this problem.  I can get around it with a make-table query, but since someone else is maintaining the Access database, I'd rather not make any changes to it.</p>

"3928429","<p>I am looking for an algorithm that will allow me to visually separate any two to four vehicles within a large list of vehicles that are close enough together on a map such that they obscure one another.  I need to filter out instances where there are more than four vehicles as the vehicles will congregate in certain areas in large quantities and it is unimportant to separate them in those cases.  The algorithm should also mark vehicles that have already been processed.</p>

<p>In my problem space, it is more important to know that the vehicles are present and to be able to see information about them, than to have absolutely accurate information as to where they are.</p>

<p>The idea is to add approximately 10 yards (given the map scale that is being used) so individual vehicles can be seen instead of being obscured by other vehicles in close proximity.  </p>

<p>I have thought of several ways to do this, but given the quality of the answers here and the fact that somebody might have already done this, I thought I would post the question.</p>

<p>I am adding an image of what is currently shown in order to help clarify as one of the comments suggested (OK, it is not a diagram but this is what is actually shown to the user).  </p>

<p>Several of the answers require changing the visual queues used to indicate how many vehicles (golf cars) are in a given location.  I don't want to change what the users are expecting visually and have to explain to the users what the meaning is.  The answer using a square is closest to what I was looking for but that is just the visual part.  I am also looking for the algorithm for how to best traverse the list finding groups of 2 to 4 golf cars that are within n (lets say 5) yards of each other while ignoring larger groupings (cart barn, snack shack, etc).  The numbers on the icons correspond to the cart numbers.</p>

<p>This application also allows the user to zoom the map in/out so the further zoomed out the map the more separation is needed between the cars so that they do not visually overlap.  </p>

<p>Note in the picture that cars 78 and 62 are obscuring the cars that are behind them.</p>

<p>I would take the average location of all vehicles in ""overlapping"" proximity, and set this as the ""center"" of the square, with length and width sufficently large that putting a vehicle on each corner will not result in any overlap.</p>

<p>Then I would start with vehicle 0 at the top left and work my way around the corners of the square counter clockwise, adding the next vehicle to the next corner. </p>

<p>Simple, and effective, you lose some accuracy, assuming thats OK (from your post it seems it is?) this is what I woul do.</p>

"3928793","<p>I need to port an application from PHP to JSF 2.  Everything is fine except for a rather complex radio button group:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/a9A37.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>When 'Process Application for:' is selected, the child radio button group is enabled. Within that, when 'Other' is selected, the corresponding text box is enabled.  When 'Brands' is selected, those two text boxes are enabled.  Of course, deselecting any of these disables the corresponding tags again.</p>

<p>I can't think of any way to do this, beyond 3 separate <code>&lt;h:selectOneRadioButton /&gt;</code> tags, with a ton of javascript handling disabling / enabling of tags, and more javascript handling selecting / deselecting across the different radio buttons so that they appear to be a single group of radio buttons.  Can anyone think of a better solution than this?  Something like a custom <code>&lt;h:selectItem /&gt;</code>? </p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","JSF complex cascading radio buttons","<javascript><html><jsf><radio-button><jsf-2>","2010-10-13 23:09:44","3375","3929789","1","<p>Your best bet is <a href=""http://myfaces.apache.org/tomahawk/"" rel=""nofollow"">Tomahawk's</a> <a href=""http://myfaces.apache.org/tomahawk-project/tomahawk20/tagdoc/t_selectOneRadio.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>&lt;t:selectOneRadio&gt;</code></a> with <code>layout</code> attribute set to <code>spread</code>. This has the added advantage that you will be able to position the individual radio buttons in the HTML markup the way you want using <a href=""http://myfaces.apache.org/tomahawk-project/tomahawk20/tagdoc/t_radio.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>&lt;t:radio&gt;</code></a>, as opposed to the standard <code>&lt;h:selectOneRadio&gt;</code> which only supports the <code>layout</code> attributes <code>pageDirection</code> and <code>lineDirection</code> and renders a table.</p>

<p>However, while playing around your functional requirement with the fresh new Tomahawk library for JSF 2.0 and adding <code>&lt;f:ajax&gt;</code> functionality to be able to disable/enable the necessary components with help of ajaxical powers, I unfortunately encountered a bug in Tomahawk. Inside <code>&lt;t:selectOneRadio&gt;</code>, the <code>&lt;f:ajax&gt;</code> incorrectly renders its client ID instead of the one of <code>&lt;t:radio&gt;</code> as argument for the ajax call which caused the ajax function to broke. I've reported it as <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TOMAHAWK-1551"" rel=""nofollow"">Tomahawk issue 1551</a>.</p>

<p>I don't see other clean solutions to achieve this complex (at least, in JSF component terms) requirement. Until the Tomahawk guys get it fixed, your best bet is introducing a temporary JS based workaround to fix the incorrect argument for the ajax call during onload. For your information only, here's how the form would look like:</p>

"3930699","<p>I am developing a board game. I am wondering how one can use Core Animation or any other technology to design a chess board like (someone else's app):</p>

<p><a href=""http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/036/Purple/f9/c5/6e/mzl.pakeubcn.320x480-75.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://a1.phobos.apple.com/us/r1000/036/Purple/f9/c5/6e/mzl.pakeubcn.320x480-75.jpg</a></p>

<p>In the picture, the chess boards has a thick border which I am not sure how to model. Should we model the chess board as an image and place chess pieces onto the image? But then it would be difficult to detect what particular square the user touches. If the chess board itself is an image, I wonder how the pieces can be placed on the image. I mean, you would have to calculate coordinatives and positions very carefully.</p>

<p>This is what I came up with using Core Animation, there is no boarder, visually it's horrible:</p>

It doesn't complicate calculations, as it will be your chess view which is handling the touches. The task of the encompassing view is merely to draw the border frame, or if your chess view is transparent, the whole board.</p>

"3930813","<p>I'm running into an inconsistent optimization behavior with different compilers for the following code:</p>

<pre><code>class tester
{
public:
    tester(int* arr_, int sz_)
        : arr(arr_), sz(sz_)
    {}

    int doadd()
    {
        sm = 0;
        for (int n = 0; n &lt; 1000; ++n) 
        {
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; sz; ++i)
            {
                sm += arr[i];
            }
        }
        return sm;
    }
protected:
    int* arr;
    int sz;
    int sm;
};
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>doadd</code> function simulates some intensive access to members (ignore the overflows in addition for this question). Compared with similar code implemented as a function:</p>

<pre><code>int arradd(int* arr, int sz)
{
    int sm = 0;
    for (int n = 0; n &lt; 1000; ++n) 
    {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; sz; ++i)
        {
            sm += arr[i];
        }
    }
    return sm;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong><code>doadd</code> method runs about 1.5 times slower than the <code>arradd</code> function</strong> when compiled in Release mode with Visual C++ 2008. When I modify the <code>doadd</code> method to be as follows (aliasing all members with locals):</p>

<pre><code>int doadd()
{
    int mysm = 0;
    int* myarr = arr;
    int mysz = sz;
    for (int n = 0; n &lt; 1000; ++n) 
    {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; mysz; ++i)
        {
            mysm += myarr[i];
        }
    }
    sm = mysm;
    return sm;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Runtimes become roughly the same. Am I right in concluding that this is a missing optimization by the Visual C++ compiler? <code>g++</code> seems to do it better and run both the member function and the normal function at the same speed when compiling with <code>-O2</code> or <code>-O3</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p><em>The benchmarking is done by invoking the <code>doadd</code> member and <code>arradd</code> function on some sufficiently large array (a few millions of integers in size).</em></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Some fine-grained testing shows that the main culprit is the <code>sm</code> member. Replacing all others by local versions still makes the runtime long, but once I replace <code>sm</code> by <code>mysm</code> the runtime becomes equal to the function version.</p>

<h1>Resolution</h1>

<p>Dissapointed with the answers (sorry guys), I shaked off my laziness and dove into the disassembly listings for this code. My <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3930813/optimization-of-access-to-members-in-c/4002917#4002917"">answer below</a> summarizes the findings. In short: it has nothing to do with aliasing, it has all to do with loop unrolling, and with some strange heuristics MSVC applies when deciding which loop to unroll.</p>

Turns out aliasing wasn't a problem at all, and neither was some kind of paranoid thread safety.</p>

<p>Here is the interesting part of the <code>arradd</code> function disassambled:</p>

<pre><code>    for (int n = 0; n &lt; 10; ++n)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; sz; ++i)
013C101C  mov         ecx,ebp 
013C101E  mov         ebx,29B9270h 
        {
            sm += arr[i];
013C1023  add         eax,dword ptr [ecx-8] 
013C1026  add         edx,dword ptr [ecx-4] 
013C1029  add         esi,dword ptr [ecx] 
013C102B  add         edi,dword ptr [ecx+4] 
013C102E  add         ecx,10h 
013C1031  sub         ebx,1 
013C1034  jne         arradd+23h (13C1023h) 
013C1036  add         edi,esi 
013C1038  add         edi,edx 
013C103A  add         eax,edi 
013C103C  sub         dword ptr [esp+10h],1 
013C1041  jne         arradd+16h (13C1016h) 
013C1043  pop         edi  
013C1044  pop         esi  
013C1045  pop         ebp  
013C1046  pop         ebx  
</code></pre>

<p><code>ecx</code> points to the array, and we can see that the internal loop is <em>unrolled x4 here</em> - note the four consecutive <code>add</code> instructions from following addresses, and <code>ecx</code> being advanced by 16 bytes (4 words) at a time inside the loop.</p>

<p>For the unoptimized version of the member function, <code>doadd</code>:</p>

<pre><code>int tester::doadd()
{
    sm = 0;
    for (int n = 0; n &lt; 10; ++n)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; sz; ++i)
        {
            sm += arr[i];
        }
    }
    return sm;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The disassembly is (it's harder to find since the compiler inlined it into <code>main</code>):</p>

<pre><code>    int tr_result = tr.doadd();
013C114A  xor         edi,edi 
013C114C  lea         ecx,[edi+0Ah] 
013C114F  nop              
013C1150  xor         eax,eax 
013C1152  add         edi,dword ptr [esi+eax*4] 
013C1155  inc         eax  
013C1156  cmp         eax,0A6E49C0h 
013C115B  jl          main+102h (13C1152h) 
013C115D  sub         ecx,1 
013C1160  jne         main+100h (13C1150h) 
</code></pre>

<p>Note 2 things:</p>

<ul>
<li>The sum is stored in a register - <code>edi</code>. Hence, <strong>there's not aliasing ""care"" taken here</strong>. The value of <code>sm</code> isn't re-read all the time. <code>edi</code> isinitialized just once and then used as a temporary. You don't see its return since the compiler optimized it and used <code>edi</code> directly as the return value of the inlined code.</li>
<li>The <strong>loop is not unrolled.</strong> Why? No good reason.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, here's an ""optimized"" version of the member function, with <code>mysm</code> keeping the sum local manually:</p>

<pre><code>int tester::doadd_opt()
{
    sm = 0;
    int mysm = 0;
    for (int n = 0; n &lt; 10; ++n)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; sz; ++i)
        {
            mysm += arr[i];
        }
    }
    sm = mysm;
    return sm;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The (again, inlined) disassembly is:</p>

<pre><code>    int tr_result_opt = tr_opt.doadd_opt();
013C11F6  xor         edi,edi 
013C11F8  lea         ebp,[edi+0Ah] 
013C11FB  jmp         main+1B0h (13C1200h) 
013C11FD  lea         ecx,[ecx] 
013C1200  xor         ecx,ecx 
013C1202  xor         edx,edx 
013C1204  xor         eax,eax 
013C1206  add         ecx,dword ptr [esi+eax*4] 
013C1209  add         edx,dword ptr [esi+eax*4+4] 
013C120D  add         eax,2 
013C1210  cmp         eax,0A6E49BFh 
013C1215  jl          main+1B6h (13C1206h) 
013C1217  cmp         eax,0A6E49C0h 
013C121C  jge         main+1D1h (13C1221h) 
013C121E  add         edi,dword ptr [esi+eax*4] 
013C1221  add         ecx,edx

013C1225  sub         ebp,1 
013C1228  jne         main+1B0h (13C1200h) 
</code></pre>

<p>The loop here is unrolled, but just x2. </p>

<p>This explains my speed-difference observations quite well. For a 175e6 array, the function runs ~1.2 secs, the unoptimized member ~1.5 secs, and the optimized member ~1.3 secs. (Note that this may differ for you, on another machine I got closer runtimes for all 3 versions).</p>

<p>What about gcc? When compiled with it, all 3 versions ran at ~1.5 secs. Suspecting the lack of unrolling I looked at <code>gcc</code>'s disassembly and indeed: <strong>gcc doesn't unroll any of the versions</strong>.</p>

<p>[Edit: Sorry, I misread slightly. That would also leave the text in the 2nd bar. There's no way to get the colour of a rectangle as far as I know, but you could do:</p>

<pre><code>rects = ax.bar(ind, num, width, color=colors)

rect = rects[-1]
height = int(rect.get_height())

<p>That would set the text in the last bar only. </p>

<p>If it could be any bar that might be purple, not necessarily the last one, well, you've got the list of colours you initialised the rectangles with, so:</p>

<pre><code>rects = ax.bar(ind, num, width, color=colors)

for i in range(len(colors):
    if colors[i] == purple: # or however you specified ""purple"" in your colors list
       labelled_rects.append(i)

    rect = rects[i]
    height = int(rect.get_height())

    if height &lt; 5:
        yloc = height + 2
    else:
        yloc = height / 2.0

    clr = '#182866'
    p = 'H37Rv'

<p>The above code works fine, and I can actually record audio from the device, and I hear my voice and such.  The problem is that after some seconds, a very strange pattern of distortion starts to emerge until the entire signal is drowned out.  Here's a screenshot of a recording of silence which I made by putting some tape over the mic and let the app record for a minute or so:</p>

<p>The problem is definitely <strong>not</strong> due to my effect processing code, as I have tried commenting it out and get the same results in both cases.  I have scoured the web for other code or people who might be experiencing similar problems, but haven't found anything.</p>

"3935529","<p>a few minutes ago i asked <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3935005/recursive-cte-to-find-parent-records"">here</a> how to get parent records with a recursive CTE.
This works now, but I get the wrong order(backwards, ordered by the PK idData) when i create a Table valued Function which returns all parents. I cannot order directly because i need the logical order provided by the CTE.</p>

<p>This gives the correct order(from next parent to that parent and so on):</p>

<pre><code>declare @fiData int;
set @fiData=16177344;
WITH PreviousClaims(idData,fiData) 
AS(
    SELECT parent.idData,parent.fiData
    FROM tabData parent
    WHERE parent.idData = @fiData

    UNION ALL

    SELECT child.idData,child.fiData
    FROM tabData child
    INNER JOIN PreviousClaims parent ON parent.fiData = child.idData
)
select iddata from PreviousClaims
</code></pre>

<p>But the following function returns all records in backwards order(ordered by PK):</p>

<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[_previousClaimsByFiData] (
    @fiData INT
)

RETURNS @retPreviousClaims TABLE 
(
    idData int PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL
)
AS 
BEGIN
    DECLARE @idData int;

    WITH PreviousClaims(idData,fiData) 
    AS(
        SELECT parent.idData,parent.fiData
        FROM tabData parent
        WHERE parent.idData = @fiData

        UNION ALL

        SELECT child.idData,child.fiData
        FROM tabData child
        INNER JOIN PreviousClaims parent ON parent.fiData = child.idData
    )

    INSERT INTO @retPreviousClaims
        SELECT idData FROM PreviousClaims;
    RETURN;
END;

select * from dbo._previousClaimsByFiData(16177344);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>
Since everybody beliefs that the CTE is not ordering(<em>Any ""ordering"" will be totally arbitrary and coincidental</em>), i'm wondering why the opposite seems to be true. I have queried a child claim with many parents and the order in the CTE is exactly the logical order when i go from child to parent and so on. This would mean that the CTE is iterating from record to record like a cursor and the following select returns it in exact this order. But when i call the TVF i got the order of the primary key idData instead.</p>

<p>The solution was simple. I only needed to remove the parent key of the return-Table of the TVF. So change...</p>

<pre><code>RETURNS @retPreviousClaims TABLE 
(
   idData int PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL
)
</code></pre>

<p>to...</p>

<pre><code>RETURNS @retPreviousClaims TABLE 
(
     idData int
)
</code></pre>

<p>.. and it keeps the right ""order"" (same order they were inserted into the CTE's temporary result set).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE2:</strong>
Because Damien mentioned that the ""CTE-Order"" could change in certain circumstances, i will add a new column <code>relationLevel</code> to the CTE which describes the level of relationship of the parent records (what is by the way quite useful in general f.e. for a ssas cube). 
So the final Inline-TVF(which returns all columns) is now:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION [dbo].[_previousClaimsByFiData] (
    @fiData INT
)

RETURNS TABLE AS
RETURN(
    WITH PreviousClaims 
    AS(
        SELECT 1 AS relationLevel, child.*
        FROM tabData child
        WHERE child.idData = @fiData

        UNION ALL

        SELECT relationLevel+1, child.*
        FROM tabData child
        INNER JOIN PreviousClaims parent ON parent.fiData = child.idData
    )

    SELECT TOP 100 PERCENT * FROM PreviousClaims order by relationLevel
)
</code></pre>

<p>This is an exemplary relationship:</p>

<pre><code>select idData,fiData,relationLevel from dbo._previousClaimsByFiData(46600314);
</code></pre>

","Complex editing on a gridview in C#","<c#><asp.net><sql-server><sql-server-2005><gridview>","2010-10-14 18:35:52","1074","3936499","3","<p>One approach is to allow the updates in a more Ajaxy way, as Aristos discusses. This is typically considered a more user friendly approach and will certainly offer a nicer user experience, but requires familiarity with jQuery and JavaScript and the interactions between the client and the server are a little more complex from your perspective.</p>

<p>If you want to continue to use the Web control paradigm, consider making the ""Arrives At"" and ""Leaves At"" fields TemplateFields. In the ItemTemplate you could continue to display the text you concatenate at the database, but you'd put a GridView in the EditItemTemplate. This GridView could be bound to a data source control (also in the EditItemTemplate) and configured to support editing. If you are programmatically binding data (i.e., you are <em>not</em> using a data source control) then you'll need to bind the data to the child GridView whenever the parent row becomes editable. This can be done declaratively using markup like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:TemplateField ...&gt;
    &lt;EditItemTemplate&gt;
        &lt;asp:GridView runat=""server"" id=""gvChild"" DataSource='&lt;%# SomeFunction() %&gt;' ...&gt;
           ...
        &lt;/asp:GridView&gt;
    &lt;/EditItemTemplate&gt;
&lt;/asp:TemplateField&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>SomeFunction</code> would be a function in your code-behind class (typically) that returns the data to bind to the grid.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could bind the data to the child GridView programmatically via the parent GridView's <code>RowDataBound</code> event handler. Namely, you would check to see if you are dealing with the row being edited (that is, if <code>e.Row.RowIndex = ParentGridViewID.EditIndex</code>). If so, you could programmatically reference the child GridView using <code>e.Row.FindControl(""ChildGridViewID"")</code> and then set its <code>DataSource</code> property and call its <code>DataBind</code> method.</p>

<p>When a users clicks the Edit button for the parent grid the ""Arrive At"" and ""Leave At"" cells will show as a grid with Edit buttons of their own to modify the individual times. Alternatively, you could put the child editable GridView in the ItemTemplate if you wanted to let the users edit the ""Arrive At"" and ""Leave At"" times without requiring the user to first choose to edit the parent record.</p>

<li><p>Does the web server <strong>have permission</strong> to read the .htpasswd file? Try putting it in the same directory as the .htaccess file and update the pathname in .htaccess accordingly.

<p>It might not be the exact match (ex. i don't know how to right align without calling text directly), and if you try to resize it the text will jump around, so you would have to tweak the parameters further to fit your needs. But it goes to show that you can get far with using only basic plot functionality in R.</p>

<p>EDIT: As was commented, the white stripes cross the bars. This is inevitable and cant be adjusted with another call to <code>barplot</code> since that would redraw the plot area. Thus we have to take a peek into the source-code of <code>barplot</code> and customize it for this purpose (love how easy this is in R). But now we have moved outside of the comfy basics in R (i.e. using built in barplot). Here is another go at it:</p>

"3938833","<p>I'm trying to set up a <code>CTFrame</code> that exactly matches my <code>UITextView</code>'s text format in iPad.
First of all, I converted <code>UITextView</code>'s text to an attributed string. Then I set up a width and a height of drawing box in which Core Text will draw text.
I succeeded to draw text using Core Text, but <code>UITextView</code> and Core Text show slightly different results even though I used the same font and size.
Specifically, when I used <code>[UIFont systemFontOfSize:21]</code>, each space in <code>UITextView</code> has one more pixel than Core Text's result. </p>

<p>It's okay for a short sentence or word, but if <code>UITextView</code> and Core Text have multiple lines, their result become very different. For example, <code>UITextView</code> performs word-wrapping for one word at the end of line, while Core Text keeps that word in the same line. If you see the attached picture, the start positions of the last word ""paragraph"" are already very different (8 pixel gap due to 8 space characters).</p>

<p>More badly, if I use different fonts such as a custom font added to my project, each character in <code>UITextView</code> has 1 pixel more.</p>

<p>I'm using Core Text to find the pixel-position of the current cursor in <code>UITextView</code>, so both of them should perfectly match each other, containing the same number of characters and words in each line.</p>

<p><strong>Question: Is there a way to make Core Text object that perfectly matches UITextView's text format?</strong> </p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Here's a code how I set up attributed string. (I just followed Core Text Guide.)</p>

<pre><code>CTFontRef font = CTFontCreateWithName((CFStringRef) [UIFont systemFontOfSize:21.0].fontName, 21.0, NULL);
CFMutableAttributedStringRef attrString2 = CFAttributedStringCreateMutable(kCFAllocatorDefault, 0);
CFAttributedStringReplaceString (attrString2, CFRangeMake(0, 0), (CFStringRef) string);
CFAttributedStringSetAttribute(attrString2, CFRangeMake(0, [string length]),kCTFontAttributeName, font);

<p>Above I had documented three possible solutions based on my research, plus suggestions etc</p>

<p>They aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, and could be a slight variation or combination of any of the three, however the gist of the solutions are there.  Let me know which one you think makes the most sense, and might perform the best.</p>

<p>Solution A: Using mapreduce (or tasks), serialize each record, and create a memcache entry for each individual record keyed with the keyname.  Then process these items individually into the pdf/xls file. (use get_multi and set_multi)</p>

<p>Solution B: Using tasks, serialize groups of records, and load them into the db as a blob.  Then trigger a task once all records are processed that will load each blob, deserialize them and then load the data into the final file.</p>

<p>Solution C: Using mapreduce, retrieve the keynames and store them as a list, or serialized blob.  Then load the records by key, which would be faster than the current loading method.  If I were to do this, which would be better, storing them as a list (and what would the limitations be...I presume a list of 100,000 would be beyond the capabilities of the datastore) or as a serialized blob (or small chunks which I then concatenate or process)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any advice.</p>
","How to generate large files (PDF and CSV) using AppEngine and Datastore?","<google-app-engine><google-cloud-datastore>","2010-10-15 01:34:57","1807","3939146","2","<p>Here is one quick thought, assuming it is crapping out fetching from the datastore. You could use <a href=""http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/taskqueue/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">tasks</a> and <a href=""http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/queryclass.html#Query_cursor"" rel=""nofollow"">cursors</a> to fetch the data in smaller chunks, then do the generation at the end.</p>

<p>Start a task which does the initial query and fetches 300 (arbitrary number) records, then enqueues a named(!important) task that you pass the cursor to.  That one in turn queries <em>[your arbitrary number]</em> records, and then passes the cursor to a new named task as well.  Continue that until you have enough records.</p>

<p>Within each task process the entities, then store the serialized result in a text or blob property on a 'processing' model.  I would make the model's key_name the same as the task that created it.  Keep in mind the serialized data will need to be under the API call size limit.</p>

<p>To serialize your table pretty fast you could use:</p>

<pre><code>serialized_data = ""\x1e"".join(""\x1f"".join(voter) for voter in data)
</code></pre>

<p>Have the last task (when you get enough records) kick of the PDf or CSV generation.  If you use key_names for you models you, should be able to grab all of the entities with encoded data by key. Fetches by key are pretty fast, you'll know the model's keys since you know the last task name.  Again, you'll want to be mindful size of your fetches from the datastore!</p>

<p>To deserialize:</p>

<pre><code>list(voter.split('\x1f') for voter in serialized_data.split('\x1e'))
</code></pre>

<p>Now run your PDF / CSV generation on the data.  If splitting up the datastore fetches alone does not help you'll have to look into doing more of the processing in each task.</p>

<p>Don't forget in the 'build' task you'll want to raise an exception if any of the interim models are not yet present.  Your final task will automatically retry.</p>

"3938958","<p>We have a database with a bunch of wide tables (40-80 columns each) and just found a bug that introduced NULL values into about 500 of the records. The NULL values can appear in any of the columns (all are integer columns, see image below) but these NULL values are causing issues with one of our reporting systems that cannot be changed easily. We need to replace the NULL values with a specific static value (in this case 99), but since this change has to be made on a per-column basis for over 250 different columns I would rather not write individual TSQL scripts updating each column one by one.</p>

<p>My brain is too fried right now to think up a clever solution, so my question is how can I perform this task on all columns on a table (or better yet multiple tables) using a simple and readable SQL query. I can isolate the records easy enough using a chain of <code>WHERE (Answer_1 IS NULL) OR (Answer_2 IS NULL) OR ...</code> or even by AdministrationID numbers for each table, but this trick won't work when updating as where clause is per row not per column. Any advice?</p>

<p>But you could use this in the UPDATE statement:</p>

<p>To change the default:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you omit the ENGINE or TYPE option,
  the default storage engine is used.
  Normally, this is MyISAM, but you can

<p>The <em>next</em> time you call <code>scanf</code>, the pointer will <em>still</em> point to the decimal point and your scan will return immediately because there are no digits there to scan.</p>

<p>You should be checking the return value from <code>scanf</code> - it gives you the number of items successfully scanned which will be 1 initially for the <code>1</code> before the decimal point, and 0 from then on.</p>

<p>As an aside, <code>scanf</code> stands for ""scan formatted"" and I'll guarantee you won't find anything <em>more</em> unformatted than user input.</p>

    // If it was too long, there'll be no newline. In that case, we flush
    // to end of line so that excess doesn't affect the next call.
    if (buff[strlen(buff)-1] != '\n') {
        extra = 0;
        while (((ch = getchar()) != '\n') &amp;&amp; (ch != EOF))
            extra = 1;
        return (extra == 1) ? TOO_LONG : OK;
    }

    // Otherwise remove newline and give string back to caller.
    buff[strlen(buff)-1] = '\0';
    return OK;
}

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre><code>// Test program for getLine().

int main (void) {
    int rc;
    char buff[10];

    rc = getLine (""Enter string&gt; "", buff, sizeof(buff));
    if (rc == NO_INPUT) {
        // Extra NL since my system doesn't output that on EOF.
        printf (""\nNo input\n"");
        return 1;

<p>I have recently released a beta update* to my polygon clipping library 'Clipper' that does do line-polygon and line-line clipping (where lines can be curves too).

This 'update' never got beyond this beta release and is now simply 'proof-of-concept'.

"3941811","<p>I have designed quite a long flash movie, it's for an advert. </p>

<p>The movie was designed in several flash files, each has been combined into a single movie clip and then all the movie clips have been moved into the master document. </p>

<p>Each movie clip is on a single slide.</p>

<p>They play through and when a clip reached the end I have used the actionscript <code>root.gotoAndPlay(x)</code> where <code>x</code> is the slide number of the next clip in the sequence as such my timeline looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/bycxk.png"" alt=""timeline example""></p>

<p>I need to add a control feature with four buttons:</p>

<ul>
<li>play </li>
<li>pause </li>
<li>rewind</li>
<li>fast forward</li>
</ul>

<p>How can I do this? I can only find resources online that allow for control features where everything is on the same timeline, and not for controlling movie clips.</p>

<p>I have little experience of actionscript however am experienced in other languages (JS and PHP).</p>
","How to add a control feature to a flash movie built of compiled movie clips","<flash><actionscript-2>","2010-10-15 11:32:53","1736","4035479","1","<p>First, give an instance name to each of your scene movie clips. Make it something that you can parse, such as ""clip_1"", ""clip_2"", ""clip_3"", etc.</p>

<p>Second, put frame labels on each of the frames where you have scene clips - named similarly to the movie clips: ""scene_1"", ""scene_2"", etc.</p>

<p>Now, create a new actionscript layer in your main timeline and make sure that its timeline extends to the end of the main timeline. it will automatically have a blank keyframe in frame 1.</p>

<p>We're going to create a variable to hold a reference to the clip that is currently playing:</p>

<pre><code>var currentClip:MovieClip = null;
</code></pre>

<p>There are a number of ways that we can track the current clip - all of them are tedious at some point if you haven't planned the implementation ahead of time. I'm going to try the one that I think will be easiest for <strong>you</strong> to implement.</p>

<p>In each of your actions frames where a movieclip resides you're going to add the following line of code:</p>

<pre><code>currentClip = eval(""clip_x"");
</code></pre>

<p>You'll need to change the value of x in ""clip_x"" in each frame to match the number of the clip that's in the frame.</p>

<p>Now, go back to the second actions layer that you created - we're going to handle the rev, ff, play, and pause actions here.</p>

<pre><code>function Play() : Void {
   if(currentClip!=null &amp;&amp; currentClip!=undefined) {
        currentClip.play();
   }
}

function Pause() : Void {
   if(currentClip!=null &amp;&amp; currentClip!=undefined) {
        currentClip.stop();
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so we have play and pause covered. How you handle FF and REV is going to depend on how you want the user to interact with those buttons. Generally there are two approaches: ""Jump"" and ""Scan"". The ""Jump"" approach moves the playhead forward/back a predetermined number of frames each time the button is pressed. The ""Scan"" approach moves the playhead forward/back X frames per secoond for as long as the button is held down, where X is the fps rate of your movie.</p>

<p>I think that the Jump approach will be the easiest for you to implement:</p>

<p>var JUMP_RATE = 30; //this is the number of frames to ""jump"" each time we hit the ff or rev buttons</p>

<pre><code>function FF() : Void {
     if(currentClip!=null &amp;&amp; currentClip!=undefined) {
           if(currentClip._currentFrame + JUMP_RATE &lt; currentClip._totalFrames)
                 currentClip.gotoAndPlay(currentClip._currentFrame + JUMP_RATE);
           else
                 currentClip.gotoAndStop(currentClip._totalFrames);
     }
}

function REV() : Void {
     if(currentClip!=null &amp;&amp; currentClip!=undefined) {
           if(currentClip._currentFrame - JUMP_RATE &gt; 0)
                 currentClip.gotoAndPlay(currentClip._currentFrame - JUMP_RATE);
           else
                 currentClip.gotoAndPlay(0);
     }
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Now all that's left for you to do is create your buttons and add the function calls to their onPress or onRelease events.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>You need to break the hex code into 3 pieces to get the individual red, green, and blue intensities. Each 2 digits of the code represent a value in hexadecimal (base-16) notation. I won't get into the details of the conversion here, they're easy to look up.</p>
<p>Once you have the intensities for the individual colors, you can determine the overall intensity of the color and choose the corresponding text.</p>
<pre><code>if (red*0.299 + green*0.587 + blue*0.114) &gt; 186 use #000000 else use #ffffff

<p>The threshold of 186 is based on theory, but can be adjusted to taste. Based on the comments below a threshold of 150 may work better for you.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The above is simple and works reasonably well, and seems to have good acceptance here at StackOverflow. However, one of the comments below shows it can lead to non-compliance with W3C guidelines in some circumstances. Herewith I derive a modified form that always chooses the highest contrast based on the guidelines. If you <em>don't</em> need to conform to W3C rules then I'd stick with the simpler formula above.  For an interesting look into the problems with this see <a href=""https://github.com/w3c/wcag/issues/695"" rel=""noreferrer"">Contrast Ratio Math and Related Visual Issues</a>.</p>
<p>The formula given for contrast in the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/"" rel=""noreferrer"">W3C Recommendations (WCAG 2.0)</a> is <code>(L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05)</code>, where <code>L1</code> is the luminance of the lightest color and <code>L2</code> is the luminance of the darkest on a scale of 0.0-1.0. The luminance of black is 0.0 and white is 1.0, so substituting those values lets you determine the one with the highest contrast. If the contrast for black is greater than the contrast for white, use black, otherwise use white. Given the luminance of the color you're testing as <code>L</code> the test becomes:</p>
<pre><code>if (L + 0.05) / (0.0 + 0.05) &gt; (1.0 + 0.05) / (L + 0.05) use #000000 else use #ffffff
</code></pre>
<p>This simplifies down algebraically to:</p>
<pre><code>if L &gt; sqrt(1.05 * 0.05) - 0.05
</code></pre>
<p>Or approximately:</p>
<pre><code>if L &gt; 0.179 use #000000 else use #ffffff
</code></pre>
<p>The only thing left is to compute <code>L</code>. That formula is also <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#relativeluminancedef"" rel=""noreferrer"">given in the guidelines</a> and it looks like the conversion from sRGB to linear RGB followed by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_(video)#Rec._601_luma_versus_Rec._709_luma_coefficients"" rel=""noreferrer"">ITU-R recommendation BT.709</a> for luminance.</p>
<pre><code>for each c in r,g,b:
    c = c / 255.0
    if c &lt;= 0.04045 then c = c/12.92 else c = ((c+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4
L = 0.2126 * r + 0.7152 * g + 0.0722 * b
</code></pre>
<p>The threshold of 0.179 should not be changed since it is tied to the W3C guidelines. If you find the results not to your liking, try the simpler formula above.</p>

","Heap memory behaviour","<java><memory-management>","2010-10-15 14:52:49","854","3943484","2","<p>Not necessarily.  The garbage collector is free to use up to the maximum allocated heap in any way it sees fit.  Extrapolating future GC behaviour based on current behaviour (but with different memory conditions) is in no way guaranteed to be accurate.</p>

<p>This does have the unfortunate side effect that it's very difficult to determine whether an OutOfMemoryError is <em>going</em> to happen unless it does.  A legal (yet probably quite inefficient) garbage collector could simply do nothing until the memory ceiling was hit, then do a stop-the-world mark and sweep of the entire heap.  With this implementation, you'd see your memory constantly increasing, and might be tempted to say that an OOME was imminent, but <em>you just can't tell</em>.</p>

<p>With such small heap sizes, the increase here is likely just due to bookkeeping/cache size alignment/etc.  You're talking about less than 50KB or so looking at the resolution on the scale, so I shouldn't be worried.</p>

<p>If you <strong>do</strong> think there's a legitimate risk of OutOfMemoryErrors, the only way to show this is to put a stress test together and show that the application really does run out of heap space.</p>

<p>It it possible that the cause for the performace lost is that in my first TVF(linked above) i'm looking for primary keys and in this TVF i am searching for (self referencing) foreign keys? If yes, how can i optimize my table-schema to accelerate the query?</p>

<p><hr>
<strong>UPDATE</strong>: I've found out that the cause for this performance issue was that there was no Index on fiData(the foreignkey-column on the table's primary key). After creating and reorganizing, the result came immediately.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to do is that whenever I click on ""Edit"", the Leaves At column becomes a gridview in which the Hours for the respective date appear. However, I don't know how to retrieve the respective date as a parameter for the child GridView's dataSource.</p>

<p>If anyone knows a better approach it would be much appreciated.</p>

<ol>
<li>Set the date as a datakey in the Parent GridView</li>
<li>Add an event handler for the parent GridView RowEditing event.</li>
<li>In that event set the SelectParameter of the datasource to the date of the edited row</li>
</ol>

<p>The parent GridView would look like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:GridView ID=""ParentGridView"" runat=""server"" DataSourceID=""ParentObjectDataSource""
    OnRowEditing=""ParentGridView_RowEditing"" DataKeyNames=""Date""&gt;

<p>Then you would have a datasource for the child GridView like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:ObjectDataSource ID=""ChildObjectDataSource"" runat=""server"" SelectMethod=""Blah"" TypeName=""Blah""&gt;

        &lt;asp:Parameter Type=""DateTime"" Name=""Date"" /&gt;
    &lt;/SelectParameters&gt;
&lt;/asp:ObjectDataSource&gt;

<p>Then in the code behind, you would have the RowEditing event handler like this:</p>

<pre><code>protected void ParentGridView_RowEditing(object sender, GridViewEditEventArgs e)
{

"3944640","<p>Okay, i think most of you guys out there use wspbuilder to build the wsp solutions and to deploy it. So here is my problem.</p>

<p>I'm working on a SharePoint solution which makes use of a third party dll (Telerik for Asp.Net Ajax - Telerik.Web.UI.dll) for rich experience. Since Telerik dll is a common assembly i have to deploy it to the bin folder of the webapplication instead of GAC. So here comes the problem.</p>

<p>WSPBuilder automatically deploys the dll to gac if the dll presents in the GAC folder. To deploy the telerik dll in bin i created the folder 80\bin and copied the dll there. I tried to build the wsp again and then went through the manifest.xml created. Great. The deployment target for the dll changed to WebApplication and wspbuilder was smart to create the cas policy itself.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>But Wspbuilder was not smart enough to put the four part name of SharePointPermission IPermission class. But i learnt that CAS actually requires the four part name. So i decided to make use of the -CustomCAS command line option of wspbuilder.exe to pass my custom cas policy file.</p>

<p>Here is my custom policy file -</p>

<p>So after building the wsp the cas section of the manifest.xml read this -</p>

<p>Now, the problem is that, since the Dots are placed in a canvas that's over the MultiScateImage (ZoomImage object) when I pan and zoom the Dots will stay in their respective place over the canvas. This code has some missed tries trying to keep the Dots on place while the image is panning and zooming.</p>

<p>Here's an image of the app, the blue dots around are my custom Dot object:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/gF9qr.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The main question is, how can I keep the Dots in their relative place over the image while the user zooms and pans.</p>
","Keep relative positions over MultiScaleImage","<c#><silverlight><deepzoom>","2010-10-16 03:01:13","1199","3976015","2","<p>It is tricky but definitely can be done, I recently did the same for a similar application. I won't lie, it took me several hours to get it working, so prepare for some headscratching.</p>

<p>There are basically two things involved:</p>

<p><strong>1. positioning the dots in the right place</strong></p>

<p>Math is your friend here. You will have to create some methods that transpose the multiScaleImage-based coordinates to your canvas (i.e. the viewport) coordinates.</p>

<p>First, you'll have to understand in depth ViewPortOrigin and ViewPortWidth (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.multiscaleimage.viewportorigin%28v=VS.95%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> is a very good start). They have a couple of caveats (for ex. I seem to recall that viewPortHeight has to be multiplied by the image ratio to get the actual value -or something similar).</p>

<p>To point you towards the solution: you will have to subtract viewPortOrigin and multiply/divide by viewPortWidth. If you are patient (and lucky ;-) ) tonight I'll look at my project and post some code, but it's good if you really understand those parameters -otherwise it will be tricky to debug and troubleshoot.</p>

<p>Something that helped me a lot understanding what was going on was to put some textblocks around and display viewportWidth/Origin/etc. all the time while navigating the multiscaleImage.</p>

<p>edit: you are lucky, I remembered this -so here is some code that should help. Again, I suggest you don't just copy &amp; paste without understanding as you won't get that far.</p>

<pre><code>private Point CanvasToDeepZoom(MultiScaleImage msi, Point absoluteInsideCanvas)
{
    // the only non-logical (to me) step: viewportOrigin.Y must be multiplied by the aspectRatio
    var ViewportHeight = msi.ViewportWidth * msi.AspectRatio * msi.ActualHeight / msi.ActualWidth;

    var relativeToCanvas = new Point(
        absoluteInsideCanvas.X / msi.ActualWidth,
        absoluteInsideCanvas.Y / msi.ActualHeight);

    return new Point(
        msi.ViewportOrigin.X + msi.ViewportWidth * relativeToCanvas.X,
        msi.ViewportOrigin.Y * msi.AspectRatio + ViewportHeight * relativeToCanvas.Y);
}


private Point DeepZoomToCanvas(MultiScaleImage msi, Point relativeInsideDeepZoom)
{
    var ViewportHeight = msi.ViewportWidth * msi.AspectRatio * msi.ActualHeight / msi.ActualWidth;

    var relativeToCanvas = new Point(
        (relativeInsideDeepZoom.X - msi.ViewportOrigin.X) / msi.ViewportWidth,
        (relativeInsideDeepZoom.Y - msi.ViewportOrigin.Y * msi.AspectRatio) / ViewportHeight);

    return new Point(
        relativeToCanvas.X * msi.ActualWidth,
        relativeToCanvas.Y * msi.ActualHeight);
 }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2. keeping the dots in sync during zoom and pan animation.</strong></p>

<p>The basic idea is to loop a 0 seconds-long animation that keeps updating your points position for the whole duration of the zoom/pan (1.5 seconds if I remember correctly).
the technique is explained very well <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/lutzg/archive/2008/08/19/synchronizing-images-with-the-deep-zoom-content.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. In that blog you will also find other useful resources for your particular problem.</p>

<p>The problem is, can anyone give me a rough explanation of how to approach this? I walked through the full documentation of Java3D but I couldn't find a feature to create things like these. Just some starting point would be nice already.</p>

I've played with the examples, but that's about it. However, many of the rules apply across 3D environments.</p>

<p>If you're talking about a static image: use very narrow cones, add color and transparency, possibly a texture to decrease the alpha component with respect to the distance from the cone's central axis.</p>

<p>If you're talking about an animated scene, that gets a bit harder. You need to synthesize the fog. Volumetrics will give you incredible images, but it's computationally expensive, and I don't think Jave3D supports it. However, I think you can fake it if you have an object that is parent to all of the laser beams and Java3D will let anchor a texture to the parent and let the children inherit it.</p>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong>:
I would start with a <a href=""http://download.java.net/media/java3d/javadoc/1.5.2/com/sun/j3d/utils/geometry/Cone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Cone</a> with a very small radius as a single beam.</p>

<p>It is useful when you need to redistribute the framework with your application (for example click-once):</p>

  <p>Applications that target the .NET Framework 4 Client Profile typically improve the deployment experience by having smaller download sizes and quicker install times.

"3950543","<p>I have to develop a CRUD application, that will be coded in php.</p>

<p>I've been reading about DataFlow diagrams, and it seems you usually have first of all a Level 0 DataFlow Diagram, to which they call Context Diagram.</p>

<p>Being that this is basically a 3-tier application with 3 different Actors, how should I model the Context Diagram?</p>

<p>Being that a Context Diagram is supposed to just tell us what comes in and what comes out of our System, I can't imagine anything more interesting/descriptive than the following diagram:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Ccll6.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Is this supposed to be something like this, or am I totally missing the point? This php page will connect to an Oracle database, but I guess that if the idea is to consider the System as a whole in the Context Diagram, I should ""hide"" that fact in the above diagram.</p>

<p>Where should I go on from here? I know I should ""zoom"" the System process to something more detailed. Maybe the next step would be to depict each one of the User Cases in a DataFlow diagram? Do I include repositories of data, already? For example, one for Users, other for Doctors and yet another for Administrators?</p>

<p>If not then your context diag is basically ok - although I'd probably show each entity once and use double headed arrows.  I'd agree with your reasoning for the db - it's part of the system, not external to it - so don't show it on the CD.</p>

<p>As for next steps, again you're on the right lines.  Try modelling the flow for each Use Case as a DFD.  DFDs are very useful for illustrating processing-intensive apps.  Difficult to know if that's a good match to your problem or not.</p>

<p>You'll find DFDs are also useful for driving out and validating your Class Diagram.  In fact, that's one of their strengths: datastores on the DFD should correlate with the contents of your class diagram (not necessarily one datastore to one class though).  So do include datastores as you work through the processes.  You'll find it drives out more than just the Actors.</p>

<p>Well, i was unable to find the ENTIRE answer here but i finally got what i was after. thanks very much for all of your help and patience.</p>

<p><em>as a side note:</em> i think i may have been having problems with using the int and Number types, upon closer inspection of my solution, i realised that Number was being used and not int.  turns out number contains floating points and int doesn't. my numbers were probably rounding whenever i tried to fix this my self. for all i know, TDI's answer might have been spot on and the use of int for the padding might have accumulated rounded numbers..  Oh well, you learn something every day..</p>

<p>the correct code to constrain movie clips to a container movie clip (or sprite or whatever) in the fashion i was looking for is this:</p>

<pre><code>var picContainer:PicContainer = new PicContainer();
picContainer.x = stage.stageWidth / 2 - picContainer.width / 2;
picContainer.y = stage.stageHeight / 2 - picContainer.height / 2;
addChild(picContainer);

var totalPics:int = 17;

var pic:Pic = new Pic(); //make an instance just to get its width

var xRange:Number = picContainer.width - pic.width;
var spacing:Number = xRange / (totalPics - 1);

//A little optimization: only need to calculate this number ONCE:
var yLoc:Number = picContainer.height / 2 - pic.height / 2;

for(var i:int = 0; i &lt; totalPics; i++) {
    pic = new Pic();
    pic.x = i * spacing;
    pic.y = yLoc;
    picContainer.addChild(pic);
}
</code></pre>

<p>the logic is pretty simple, and i don't know why i couldn't get it my self, because i drew diagrams that say exactly this logic. however, i must not have put the numbers in the right places or i wouldn't have had to ask, would i ;P</p>

<p><strong>BONUS CONTENT!</strong>
as an added bonus (if anyone finds this thread looking for answers..)
you could also have the 'pic's fan out from the center point (but they'd still be in order of left to right) by using this code:</p>

<pre><code>var picContainer:PicContainer = new PicContainer();
picContainer.x = stage.stageWidth / 2 - picContainer.width / 2;
picContainer.y = stage.stageHeight / 2 - picContainer.height / 2;
addChild(picContainer);

var totalPics:int = 5;

var pic:Pic = new Pic(); //make an instance just to get its width

var padding:Number = (picContainer.width - (pic.width * totalPics))  / (totalPics + 1);

for(var i:int = 0; i &lt; totalPics; i++) {
    pic = new Pic();
    pic.x = padding + i * (pic.width + padding);
    pic.y = picContainer.height / 2 - pic.height / 2;
    picContainer.addChild(pic);
}

<p>Hello, First time posting here. I hope I'm not getting anything wrong . my problem is as follows:</p>

<p>I've got a pretty basic for loop that creates a 'thumbnail' and puts it next to the previous one (With a little padding) inside a containing movie clip.</p>

<pre><code>var newPicContainer:picContainer = new picContainer();
var newPic:pic;
var amount:int = 9;
var i:int;

//Add our container
addChild(newPicContainer);

//center our container
newPicContainer.x = (stage.stageWidth/2)- (newPicContainer.width/2);
newPicContainer.y = (stage.stageHeight/2)- (newPicContainer.height/2);


for (i = 0; i &lt; amount; ++i)
{
 newPic = new pic();
 newPicContainer.addChild(newPic);

    //just so i know it's adding them..
    trace(newPic.thisOne);
 newPic.thisOne = i;

    // set this one to its self (+5 for padding..) Times, the amount already placed. 
 newPic.x = (newPic.width+5) *i;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm wondering if there is some equation or 'magic math' that I can use to figure out what the length of the container is and have the 'thumbnails' be added relative to that number.  basically squashing the thumbnails against each other to make them all fit inside..</p>

<p>something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>newPic.x = (newPic.width *i) - stuff here to make it know not to go past the containing width;
</code></pre>

<p>I must admit i'm not too great with math and so this part of coding escapes me..</p>

<p>thanks to any takers in advance..</p>

<p>This was all devised in the early days of Unicode, before we realised that UCS-2 wasn't enough, and before UTF-8 was invented. This is why Windows's support for UTF-8 is all-round poor.</p>

<p>This misguided naming scheme became part of the user interface. A text editor that uses Windows's encoding support to provide a range of encodings will automatically and inappropriately describe UTF-16LE as “Unicode”, and UTF-16BE, if provided, as “Unicode big-endian”.</p>

<p>(Other editors that do encodings themselves, like Notepad++, don't have this problem.)</p>

<p>If it makes you feel any better about it, ‘ANSI’ strings aren't based on any ANSI standard, either.</p>

"3951787","<p>In Visual Studio 2008, there was the device manager for setting up additional templates and options for the emulator. None of these options are available with Visual Studio 2010 which I understand as the features were removed.</p>

<p>With respect of <code>onclickSubmit</code> we can modify the <code>url</code> and defining of <code>serializeDelData</code> we can clear the body of the ""POST"" message.

<p>One more option is to use <code>delfunc</code> like you already use <code>editfunc</code> and <code>addfunc</code>. In the most cases the usage of such function is not really needed and one can implement the same in other way.</p>

<p>You asked for it, you got it.  To get a match you'd need CAIRO_ANTIALIAS_SUBPIXEL.  This is however not appropriate when you draw text to an image that might be displayed on another machine.

<p>Then, with CSS, you can make that text appear in the bottom right like so:</p>

<pre><code>.box {
    position:relative;
}
.bet_time {
    position:absolute;
    bottom:0;
    right:0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The way this works is that absolutely positioned elements are always positioned with respect to the first relatively positioned parent element, or the window. Because we set the box's position to relative, <code>.bet_time</code> positions its right edge to the right edge of <code>.box</code> and its bottom edge to the bottom edge of <code>.box</code></p>

"3956320","<p>What are the requirements for a custom data source to be listed in the 'Data Source' drop-down list when adding a Dataset to a .rdlc report in Report Viewer 2010?</p>

<p>As can been seen from the screen grab, for some reason it is listing potential sources from a variety of referenced assemblies, but I can't see an obvious pattern as to why it is selecting these.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/0X15p.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The 'GeneralDataSet' makes sense as that is a strongly-typed Dataset class, but I'm pretty sure most of the others are not, yet the design dialog still lists them.</p>

<p>I'm looking to roll my own custom data source and would prefer it to be selectable from this list.</p>

<p>So something like:</p>

<pre><code>public class Person

    public string name { get; set; }
    public int age { get; set; }
}

public class GetPeople

   public List&lt;Person&gt; GetPeopleList()

<p>All three show up, so take your pick. (Code is just thrashed out, ignore bad names/practices :))</p>

<p>But when you use a ReportViewer, you will need to manually set the datasets. Selecting it inside the report from what I have found just basically tells it what data to expect. So add an ObjectDataSource or just set it in the code behind.</p>

The question is how do I make the div containing the list bottom align to the green div?</li>

It may be an issue with the image you are using (as the code you posted looks fine). Images should be stored in 96 DPI (which is the standard). Other values may cause the image to scale.

"3962387","<p>I've got a table from an existing LabView VI (ewww!) that I need to replicate in C#.  The table is shown in the image below.  Each field will be populated with data returned by status queries to an external device, likely from within a dedicated status thread (when I implement it...).  Is there any control, or direction I should take when extending an existing control for the table-like display of my query results?  DataGridView seems like overkill for this, but the table layout container populated with TextBox controls seems inelegant.  I'd like some insight, if anyone can offer it.  Also, please feel free to shut me down if this has been asked already (though my search turned up nothing I could relate to...).  Thanks.

In both solution you'll see that I remove the <em>Include</em> method since <em>Include</em> does NOT allow you to filter the related data.

However, it might not be desirable in all situations as it gives a collection of anonymous type objects.<br>
<br><br>
<b>2. Two Tracked Queries (Returns EntityObjects):</b>
<br>
This one gives you a collection of your entityobject tblTelephoneNumbers:

Dim m_tblCalls = (From t In RL.App.TComEntities.tblCalls _

<p>DDD doesn't provide a modelling language itself: it's a combination of method (how to attack the problem) and architecture (how to structure your application).</p>

<p>You're expressing a business rule: a plane can have either jet engines or propeller engines but not both.</p>

<p>That's a valid constraint from the Domain, presumably it's relevant to your application, and therefore it needs to be captured in the domain logic.  So from that perspective yes, it is supported by DDD.</p>

<p>How you <em>implement</em> it will depend partly on your language choice, but I'd make a guess that Plane will be an Aggregate root and so be responsible for ensuring the constraint is met.  What DDD says is that, as a Domain constraint, it should be captured in your domain logic: not some other architectural layer.</p>

<h1>Benchmark results</h1>

<p>Got curious to what I should choose here, so I benchmarked how I should do different parts. Had various ideas myself, got some from here and other places as well. When I had found the fastest I could manage, I created a benchmark and put it to the test against all of the answers so far. For the ones that had skipped the splitting or the checking for success I added an <code>explode</code> and a <code>strpos</code> check accordingly. I also added urldecode to all the solutions as well, except @dynamism who tackled that so nicely. Anyways, here are the results:</p>

"3964707","<p>I wrote a .NET application where memory usage is growing over time. As a test,
I set it up to download 800 * 5K (average) size files and doing XML transform and using DTComcontroller to generate manifest, inside 1 hour with an interval of 15 Minutes. During a period of about 5 hours, memory usage grows from 35M to about 70M.</p>

<p>Not sure if this is normal or not. I'm already forcing it by doing</p>

<pre><code>GC.collection();
GC.WaitForPendingFinalizers();
</code></pre>

<p>at end of each working circle just to make sure the memory are released in a timely manner.</p>

<p>I already make sure close filehandle, clear stream or other resources after used it. And some objects are just using local references inside a function and I assume they will be discarded at the end of local function and go away with GC.collction().</p>

<p>Also Memory Profiler (ANTS) shows that there are no objects with my application's namespace left at the end of each of the working circle, and no new objects with source code available left as well. The new instances of objects created during each working circle are basically called RuntimeModule, RuntimeAssembly, and DeviceContext. Doesn't looks like I could do anything about it?</p>

<p>This is basically my first application which are suppose to run 24/7 and I really don't know much about memeory leak. More likely than not, there are still problems with memory usage in my application. I just don't know where to look at this stage.</p>

<p>Also, I don't know it's related or not, I am using .net Trace/debug for keep a log. Guess it worth trying to turn off the log to see the memory usage grow.</p>

<p>Update: 
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/4RV2L.png"" alt=""alt text"">
Dose it look like circle reference of sslstate and sslstream and also other Classes in the class Reference Explorer. Also not sure if that is a circle reference in ANTS generated graph, that means there is actually circle reference in my code somewhere?</p>

<p>I did a few changes by reusing the same object for XMLtransform and Manifest creation, and manually set each Object to null after finish used them in the end of working iteration. Now the memory are greatly reduced, still increase private memory usage as it is working, but much slowly.</p>

<p>I think for my particular case--create lots of objects inside a working circle, and every data is kept in a working thread. If I didn't explicitly release object references, let .NET GC doing that will lead to lots of memory used by the application as it is keep working most of the time, and GC may never get a chance to probably doing house keeping unless the application been manually closed, I have to do the object release much more manually.<br>

"3964805","<p>I have some OAM code here, and I've looked up all the instructions, what they do how they act, and I've re written it all pseudo, but I'm having a problem locating (so I can count how many) loops are in the program. I feel like it should be staring me in the eyes, and I've done a thousand factorial programs in C/Java etc.. but I can't see it here.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/TRoYJ.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>So it takes in user entry
if == 0 it breaks to done [brz]
if > 0 break to skip [brp]
neg used to negate value for abs value</p>

<p>Skip routine does the multiplication and decrememnts,
followed by more conditions to see if it needs to be called again or if the program is done.</p>

<p>I need essentially to find the loops in this program. Like I said, it's probably staring me in the face but it's a loosely asked question on the assigner's part..</p>

<p>EDIT to clarify:
The program doesn't take the factorial of one number, but rather multplies the factorial of each number entered.</p>

<p>So I could put in 3, -4, 2, 0 and the result will be 288.
(3*2*1)(4*3*2*1)(2*1)</p>

<p>You'll need to modify the JSON data for a JSONP response though.

<p>You can use a static callback by passing the right parameters to jQuery.ajax:

(1100.011)b2 = 0.1100011 x 2^4 => Exponent, E = 4.</p>

<p>The green div is your left part of the image, the red one is your right part of the image and the yellow one is your repeating center of the image. To do this you should slice your image into these 3 parts and add them as backgrounds for the 3 <code>div</code>s. Just fiddle with the dimension to make it suite your desired output.</p>

"3967176","<p><strong>Update:</strong> Microsoft have now reproduced the bug and are working on a fix.</p>

<p>Whilst evaluating the viability of the .NET platform for low latency software development, we have discovered a serious bug in the .NET 4 concurrent workstation garbage collector that can cause applications to hang for up to several minutes at a time.</p>

<p>On three of our machines the following simple C# program causes the GC to leak memory until none remains and a single mammoth GC cycle kicks in, stalling the program for several minutes (!) while 11Gb of heap is recycled:</p>

<pre><code>    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var q = new System.Collections.Generic.Queue&lt;System.Object&gt;();
        while (true)
        {
            q.Enqueue(0);
            if (q.Count &gt; 1000000)
                q.Dequeue();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>You need to compile for x64 on a 64-bit Windows OS with .NET 4 and run with the default (concurrent workstation) GC using the default (interactive) latency setting.</strong></p>

<p>Here's what the Task Manager looks like when running this program on this machine:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/fmIz5.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Note that 11Gb of heap have been leaked here when this program requires no more than 100Mb of memory.</p>

<p>We have now accumulated around a dozen repros of this bug, written in F# as well as C#, and it appears to be related to a bug in the GC write barrier when most of gen0 survives. However, Microsoft have not yet been able to reproduce it. Can you? If so, can you please describe your setup as accurately as possible so we can try to narrow down exactly what conditions are required for this bug to manifest.</p>

- (void)actionSheet:(UIActionSheet *)actionSheet didDismissWithButtonIndex:(NSInteger)buttonIndex;

"3971972","<p>I'm creating a slider bar, which will be a subclass of JSlider, as part of a logging gui.  What I'd like to do is be able to draw some items above the slider bar (e.g. a &quot;volume&quot; display, indicating how much logging info will be spit out by a particular setting).  I have overridden the paintComponent() method, but I'm getting a bit confused about how the clipping rectangle is calculated for the Graphics object that is passed in to paintComponent.</p>
<p>Basically, what I want to do is create more space within the visible area of the component that can be drawn, but only ABOVE what is already drawn.  So, for example, in the following image I have three slider bars:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/u4WDF.png"" alt=""slider bars"" /></p>
<p>The clipping rectangle is shown in red for each of these.  (These are somewhat hand-drawn, but I did actually use the drawRect(g.getClipBounds()) and came up with similar rectangles.  The top slider bar is what I get if I don't augment the slider bar at all.  The middle rectangle is what I get if I override getPreferredSize() to add some amount (I call it the 'volume height' - by default, 20) to the height of the component.  The bottom image is the one I want.  Basically, it's the middle slider bar, but with the clipping rectangle translated by 1/2 the volume height toward the top of the component.</p>
<p>So, my question is 'How are clipping rectangles computed within the Graphics object when passed in to a paintComponent() method?'  I can't seem to find out how the system determines what the clipping bounds should be for a given component.</p>

I switched to standard images (background:(/image_url/) w/o background-position) and the image looked much better - see this <img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/zsjwS.png"" alt=""screen shot"">, where the left image is served using the single image, and the ones to the right of it are served from the sprite (but are the same images in the sprite).</p>

"3974324","<p>My requirement is to show a page with multiple filters to apply to grid data.</p>

<p>Suppose we are talking about Orders and an order has the following attributes</p>

<pre><code>public class Order {
    public int OrderID
    public DateTime OrderDate
    public DateTime ShipmentDate
    public int OrderTotal
    public int OrderStatus
}
</code></pre>

<p>Inside the jqgrid object I am showing all the attributes <strong>except the OrderStatus</strong></p>

<p>The requirement is to create a view that has</p>

<ul>
<li>the jqGrid on the left part</li>
<li>a panel on the right</li>
</ul>

<p>Inside the right panel the user will see a list of checkboxes that represents every possible OrderStatus value and he want to search using both methods (for example selecting the checkbox ""Shipped Orders"" and then filtering the grid with Amount greater than a value)</p>

<p>I have already configured the advanced filtering (<code>multiplesearch:true</code>) inside the jqGrid object and I am able to create complex filters combining fields and logical operators.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how I can submit even the data from the right panel when the user press the search button?</p>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong>:</p>

<p>Preamble: Oleg sample is fantastic but unfortunately does not fits requirements of my customer :(</p>

<p>@Oleg: I do not understand why you think that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If the data are outside of the grid
  you will be show the order details on
  the right pane only for selected row.
  So the user will have not so good
  overview of the data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>maybe my description was not so clear but I am not going to show any order detail. To better clarify my requirement I have modified your sample to show you the desired final UI which is as in the following image:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/OLy6N.png--"" alt=""UI as teh customer want it""></p>

<p>The customer want to filter the data in the grid using two methods or both together:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using the <code>multiplesearch</code> facilities provided by the grid itself (thanks for the workaround mention)</li>
<li>Using the custom Search Panel (the one with the checkboxes on the right) provided</li>
</ul>

<p>From a functional point of view the requirement is very easy to express: When the user click on a checkbox or make a search using the native <code>multiplesearch</code> I should post values to the server including also the checkboxes state. </p>

<p>To summarize I should:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add the checkboxes state when a post is made through the native <code>multiplesearch</code></li>
<li>Add the current <code>multiplesearch</code> state (if any) when the user click on a checkbox</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there a way to do this?</p>

In the close case I used checkboxes <strong>inside of</strong> jqGrid. The most advantage to having the information inside of jqGrid is not only the possibility of easy searching. If the data are outside of the grid you will be show the order details on the right pane <strong>only for selected row</strong>. So the user will have not so good <em>overview</em> of the data.</p>

<p>To be able to place many checkboxes in the table without permanent horizontal scrolling I rotated headers of the columns having ""checkbox with the technique described in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2705174/vertical-textes-inside-of-table-headers-with-respect-of-a-javascript-based-on-svg"">Vertical text inside table headers using a JavaScript-based SVG library</a>. This rotation looks not perfect in IE, but in other browser it works perfect.</p>

<p>You can hold the data from the <code>OrderStatus</code> field in a hidden column and decode the bitmask to boolean which build checkboxes either on the client or on the server side.</p>

<p>Because use want to use <code>multiplesearch:true</code> I have to mention about a bug in <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/clone/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jQuery.clone</a> which follow to the bug in jqGrid multi-search in all versions of IE browsers. If you define more as one search filters only the first one will be used because the operation field of all other filters will be read as <code>undefined</code>. It's a pity, but  the bug is also not fixed in the jQuery 1.4.3 just published. To be able to use <code>multiplesearch:true</code> you can use workaround suggestion by <a href=""http://www.trirand.com/blog/?page_id=393/bugs/in-multiple-search-second-and-subsequent-ops-are-sent-as-undefined-in-ie6/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Jiho Han on trirand.com forum</a>.</p>

<p>If you do prefer to hold the checkboxes outside of the grid you can do the decoding of the bit-mask <code>OrderStatus</code> inside of <a href=""http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:events#list_of_events"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">onSelectRow</a> event handler.</p>

"3974370","<p>I tried to use the ZipKit framework (<a href=""http://bitbucket.org/kolpanic/zipkit/wiki/UsingZipKit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://bitbucket.org/kolpanic/zipkit/wiki/UsingZipKit</a>) in the test application for iPad. I followed the ""Traditional way"" of the installation (as it is described on their page) with no success. Hope somebody can help me with it:</p>

<p>1/ I used <em>hg</em> to get sources<br>
  2/ I build the <em>ZipKit</em> project (Release build)<br>
  3/ After doing this there was created in the build folder the new <em>ZipKit.framework</em> folder<br>
  4/ I have created a new test project for the iPad 3.2 (XCode 3.2.4)<br>
  5/ I have drag&amp;dropped the <em>ZipKit.framework</em> folder created in the step 3) into <em>Frameworks</em> section on my new test project<br>
  6/ In <em>Targets</em> section I have created new <em>Copy File Build Phase</em> and I drag&amp;drop the  <em>ZipKit.Framework</em> from <em>Frameworks</em> section to the new <em>Copy Files</em> folder.<br>
  7/ Then I build and run the project.   </p>

<p>The project cannot be even started, it is being closed after I press the project icon - so I must do something terribly wrong. In the console output I can see the error - it is pretty clear what is missing, but I do not know what to do with that... Might be some XCode expert or someone, who used the ZipKit can help me - this must some really stupid mistake I am doing...</p>

<p>There is the console output:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2:</strong> The Trolls at Qt provided a solution (workaround?); I posted their fix as an answer below. I'm leaving it up to their team to determine if this is a feature or bug. It apparently only behaves differently on the Mac.</p>

"3979086","<p>Using C#/.NET for my application, I've got a series of classes in my main data model that represent &quot;binary&quot; (as opposed to text) content. I've got a inheritance setup like this:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/UGWBt.jpg"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>
<p>Basically, the abstract class <code>BinaryContent</code> contains a <code>MemoryStream</code> that stores arbitrary binary data. That data is read from a file on disk. Each type of binary data I plan to store will be a derived type, such as <code>ImageContent</code> and <code>FontContent</code>. Those derived types will interpret the binary data in <code>BinaryContent.Content</code>. <code>ImageContent</code> for example, would create a <code>BitmapImage</code> (stored in an ImageSource) from the MemoryStream. <code>FontContent</code> would of course create a font from the <code>BinaryContent.Content</code>. I chose this way of doing things because I wanted to be able to basically store a copy of the content file (ie an image) and not have to rely on the file being in a particular location on disk time after time.</p>
<p>I'm also storing instances of these classes in a &quot;project file&quot; using binary serialization. I've done this to basically &quot;package&quot; everything together. I'm having trouble when I attempt to deserialize the MemoryStream, it seems. The problem happens when I create the image from the MemoryStream. When the following method runs after deserialization, a <code>FileFormatexception</code> occurs.</p>
<pre><code>private void RefreshImageFromContent()
{
    BitmapImage image = null;
    if (Content != null &amp;&amp;
        Content.Length != 0L)
    {
        image = new BitmapImage();
        image.BeginInit();
        image.StreamSource = Content;
        image.EndInit(); //throws FileFormatException
    }

    Image = image;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>FileFormatException</code> message is:
&quot;The image cannot be decoded. The image header might be corrupted.&quot;
Inner Exception: &quot;Exception from HRESULT: 0x88982F61&quot;</p>
<p>My best guess right now is that something is happening to corrupt the data in <code>BinaryContent.Content</code> when during serialization or deserialization.</p>
<p>This leads me to ask 2 questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Does anyone have any suggestions to fix this problem?</li>
<li>Does anyone have other suggested ways to store arbitrary binary data that is going to be (de)serialized?</li>
</ol>

  It is very important to note

  that the identifier may not be

  spaces or tabs before or after the
  semicolon. It's also important to
  realize that the first character
  before the closing identifier must be
  a newline as defined by the local

  systems, including Mac OS X. The
  closing delimiter (possibly followed
  by a semicolon) must also be followed
  by a newline. </p>
  
  <p>If this rule is broken and the closing

<p> </p>

<p><b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Good</a></b>  </p>

<p>The nice part is that it uses a mixture of image processing and graph operations available in most libraries, may be parallelized easily, is reasonable fast, may be tuned to use a relatively small memory footprint and doesn't have to be recalculated outside the modified area if you store the intermediate results.</p>

<p><b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Bad</a></b>  </p>

<p>I wrote ""algorithm"", in quotes, just because I developed it and surely is not robust enough to cope with pathological cases. If your graph has a lot of cycles you may end up with some phantom lines. More on this and examples later.</p>

<p><b><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Good,_the_Bad_and_the_Ugly"" rel=""noreferrer"">And The Ugly</a></b></p>

<p>The ugly part is that you need to be able to flood fill the map, which is not always possible. I posted a comment a few days ago asking if your graphs can be flood filled, but didn't receive an answer. So I decided to post it anyway.   </p>

<hr>

<h2>The Sketch</h2>  

<p>The idea is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use image processing to get a fine line of pixels representing the center path </li>
<li>Partition the image in chunks commensurated to the tunnel thinnest passages</li>
<li>At each partition, represent a point at the ""center of mass"" of the contained pixels</li>
<li>Use those pixels to represent the Vertices of a Graph</li>
<li>Add Edges to the Graph based on a ""near neighbour"" policy</li>
<li>Remove spurious small cycles in the induced Graph  </li>
<li>End- The remaining Edges represent your desired path  </li>
</ol>

<p>The parallelization opportunity arises from the fact that the partitions may be computed in standalone processes, and the resulting graph may be partitioned to find the small cycles that need to be removed. These factors also allow to reduce the memory needed by serializing instead of doing calcs in parallel, but I didn't go trough this.  </p>

<hr>

<h2>The Plot</h2>

<p>I'll no provide pseudocode, as the difficult part is just that not covered by your libraries. Instead of pseudocode I'll post the images resulting from the successive steps. 
I wrote the program in <a href=""http://www.wolfram.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Mathematica</a>, and I can post it if is of some service to you.  </p>

<p><b>A- Start with a nice flood filled tunnel image </b></p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/RJUs9.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><b>B- Apply a Distance Transformation </b>  </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/DistanceTransform.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Distance Transformation</a> gives the distance transform of image, where the value of each pixel is replaced by its distance to the nearest background pixel.<br>
You can see that our desired path is the Local Maxima within the tunnel  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/mE6JN.png"" alt=""alt text"">  </p>

<p><b>C- Convolve the image with an appropriate kernel </b>    </p>

<p>The selected kernel is a <a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/ref/LaplacianGaussianFilter.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Laplacian-of-Gaussian kernel</a> of pixel radius 2. It has the magic property of enhancing the gray level edges, as you can see below.  </p>

<p><b>D- Cutoff gray levels and Binarize the image </b>    </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/5rjm6.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><b> Comment </b>  </p>

<p>Perhaps that is enough for you, as you ay know how to transform a thin line to an approximate piecewise segments sequence. As that is not the case for me, I continued this path to get the desired segments.  </p>

<p><b>E- Image Partition</b>    </p>

<p>Here is when some advantages of the algorithm show up: you may start using parallel processing or decide to process each segment at a time. You may also compare the resulting segments with the previous run and re-use the previous results  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Glmcy.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><b>F- Center of Mass detection</b>  </p>

<p>All the white points in each sub-image are replaced by only one point at the center of mass<br>
<code>
X<sub>CM</sub> = (&Sigma; <sub>i∈<i>Points</i></sub> X<sub>i</sub>)/NumPoints<br>
</code><br>
<code>
Y<sub>CM</sub> = (&Sigma; <sub>i∈<i>Points</i></sub> Y<sub>i</sub>)/NumPoints

<p>The white pixels are difficult to see (asymptotically difficult with param ""a"" <i>age</i>), but there they are.</p>

<p><b>H- select Candidate Edges</b> </p>

<p>Using the Euclidean Distance between points, select candidate edges. A cutoff is used to select an appropriate set of Edges. Here we are using 1.5 the subimagesize.  </p>

<p>As you can see the resulting Graph have a few small cycles that we are going to remove in the next step.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/VKrQB.png"" alt=""alt text"">  </p>

<p><b>H- Remove Small Cycles</b>  </p>

<p>Using a Cycle detection routine we remove the small cycles up to a certain length. The cutoff length depends on a few parms and you should figure it empirically for your graphs family  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/8EpIm.png"" alt=""alt text"">  </p>

<p><b>I- That's it!</b>  </p>

<p>You can see that the resulting center line is shifted a little bit upwards. The reason is that I'm superimposing images of different type in Mathematica ... and I gave up trying to convince the program to do what I want :)</p>

"3983894","<p>I have two types of accounts (customer and provider), I chose the single-table strategy for persistence.

One thing that I've seen in the past is that DrawItemEventArgs.State property of the event args can casue issues. It requires careful checking since it is a flag enum where multiple states can be set simultaneously.</p>

<p>Post the drawing / measuring code for more insight.</p>

<p>Also I assume you've double buffered this control, right?</p>

<p>For a quick fix try setting this:</p>

"3985561","<p>I am a newbie to VTiger, I am using the 5.2.0 version to try, learn implementing Issue Tracking.</p>

<p><strong>Intro:</strong></p>

<p>A client sends an email to say support@company.com, Mail Converter or Mail Scanner.. scans for the new email and if found creates a new ticket.</p>

<p>If admin sees a new ticket which is being raised in Trouble Tickets, makes some changes such as assigning it to someone, or making a comment etc.. VTiger CRM sends an email to a client saying that admin has made modifications to the ticket.</p>

<p>Lets say Client wants some changes, so he replies to support@company.com, a new ticket is raised because a new mail as arrived and mail scanner creates a new ticket.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>Instead of updating an existing ticket which the client has sent before, creating a new ticket everytime duplicates the problem by making many tickets for one issue, which is a big problem.</p>

<p>When ever a client sends a mail to support@company.com, Subject of email goes as Title of the Ticket and Body of Email as Description of Ticket.</p>

<p>Lets say </p>

<pre><code>Title of Ticket is SubjectClientSent
</code></pre>

<p>Client didnot like something after admin makes some modifications and the client decides to reply to the email which VTiger has sent him, it is generally in this manner.</p>

<pre><code>Re: TT17 [ Ticket Id : 22 ] Re : SubjectClientSent
</code></pre>

<p>I dont want Mail Scanner to create a new ticket with the title of ticket as <code>Re: TT17 [ Ticket Id : 22 ] Re : SubjectClientSent</code> , I want it to update the exiting ticket with title <code>SubjectClientSent</code></p>

<p>I tried to do that with creating a new rule something like this..</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/nu0mR.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>But, its still creating a new ticket.</p>

<p>Could you help me correct this?</p>

<p>Is there a better way of updating the existing ticket?</p>

<p>The below pictures shows the <strong>basic process involved in automating ticketing with MailScanner or MailConverter</strong></p>

<p>![Mail Scanner Basic Process][4]</p>

<p><strong>1:</strong>
Customer (having a Contact/Account record) sends email to support@company.com, with subject
“Test Trouble Ticket”</p>

<p><strong>2:</strong>
Mail Scanner creates ticket, links it to matching contact/account record filtered by emailid
lookup.
HelpDeskHandler will send a acknowledgment email with more information on how to respond
further to Customer. The email subject looks like “TT15 [Ticket Id: 1483] Test Trouble Ticket”</p>

<p><strong>3:</strong>
Customer replies to the acknowledgment email keeping part of the subject intact to
support@company.com. As mail scanner is configured with Regex rule on subject and finds a
matching Trouble Ticket linked to Customer, it updates the comments with the email body.</p>

<p><strong>4:</strong>
When support team update their comment, an email is sent to Customer again.</p>

<p>The following steps will help us achieve this functionality</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Setup Outgoing Mail Server</strong></p>

<p>If your Outgoing Mail Server is Gmail, the following settings should work for you</p>

<pre><code>Mail Server Settings (SMTP)     
Server Name ssl://smtp.gmail.com:465 
User Name   username@gmail.com 
Password    ******  
From Email  from.email@gmail.com 
Requires Authentication?    Yes 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 2: Setup MailScanner or MailConverter</strong></p>

<pre><code>DEFAULT Information 

Scanner Name    DEFAULT
Server Name     imap.gmail.com
Protocol       imap4
User Name     support.company@gmail.com
SSL Type       ssl
SSL Method      novalidate-cert
Connect URL     {imap.gmail.com:993/imap4/ssl/novalidate-cert}
Status       Enabled

Scanning Information 

Look for    All Messages from lastscan
After scan   Mark message as Read
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 3: Setup Rules to create &amp; update tickets in MailScanner or MailConverter</strong></p>

<pre><code>Rules For Mail Converter [DEFAULT] 

    Priority    
    From    
    To  
    Subject     Regex   Ticket Id[^:]?: ([0-9]+)
    Body        
    Match   All Condition
    Action  Update Ticket

    Priority    
    From    
    To  
    Subject         
    Body        
    Match   Any Condition
    Action  Create Ticket 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Step 4: Configure config.inc.php</strong></p>

<p><em>update the following variables in your config.inc.php</em></p>

<p><strong>$HELPDESK_SUPPORT_EMAIL_ID</strong></p>

<p><em>FROM address information to be used when sending mails
Example: automated-reply@company.com</em></p>

<pre><code>$HELPDESK_SUPPORT_EMAIL_ID = 'auto.reply.company@gmail.com';
</code></pre>

<p><strong>$HELPDESK_SUPPORT_NAME</strong></p>

<p><em>FROM name to be used for purpose of display for emails sentout.
Example: Automated Reply</em></p>

<pre><code>$HELPDESK_SUPPORT_NAME = 'Company Support';
</code></pre>

<p><strong>$HELPDESK_SUPPORT_EMAIL_REPLY_ID</strong></p>

<p><em>REPLY-TO address to be set in the email sent.
Example: support@company.com</em></p>

<pre><code>$HELPDESK_SUPPORT_EMAIL_REPLY_ID = 'support.company@gmail.com';
</code></pre>

<p><em>Setting this information is one of the important step for autoticketing.
When user tries to Reply for the automated emails the TO
address will be set by the mail-client and reaches the MailBox for
which we have setup the scanning.</em></p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Create HelpDeskHandler.php</strong> <em>in VTigerCRM/modules/HelpDesk/</em></p>

","What is the best way to make autocomplete field using jquery (With mySql or XML ?)","<php><jquery><mysql><xml>","2010-10-21 09:09:29","468","3985930","1","<p>Access to database will be always faster than xml, maintain tasks are easier and it is more extensible.</p>

<p>Parsing XML is always resource consuming.</p>

<p>Regardless of which nodes you want to access, you have to read and parse the entire document.</p>

<p>If you were using it for reading some settings, I would suggest XML is a good option, caching it it would improve performance (this is something we do more commonly in .NET:
<a href=""http://www.asp.net/data-access/tutorials/caching-data-with-the-objectdatasource-cs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asp.net/data-access/tutorials/caching-data-with-the-objectdatasource-cs</a>)</p>

<p>But I think you're doing searches with the autocomplete, so it seems to me it's more inefficient the db.</p>

<p>As another user said in a stackoverflow question:</p>

<p>""XML is not a database. XML is a data interchange format, and using it as a database is generally an abuse.""</p>

"3986536","<p>I have two series, series1 and series2. My aim is to find <strong>how much Series2 is different from Series1,on a bin to bin basis,</strong> (each bin represents a particular feature,) automatically/quantitatively.

<p>Series1 is the expected result.
Series2 is the test/incoming series.</p>

<p>I am providing a histogram plot, where Series2 is represented in dark brown colour. You can also note in the x-axis between 221 and 353 there is a significant variation. ie Series2 is less than Series1. I am coding using C++.</p>

<p>I think, crosscorrelation will help, but produces a value based on similarity rather than dissimilarity. I see people talk about Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. Is this the test which i should be performing?</p>

<p>UPDATE 1:
I am trying to perform a template matching. I have divided my template image in to 8x8 blocks as well as my incoming test image. I am trying to compare one block in template image with the same block(based on the spatial pixel positions) in the test image. I calculate the intensity sum within each block.I obtain series1 for the Template image and have Series2 for the test image.</p>

On page 51 he writes:</p>

<p>Different groups on different layers.</p>
<p>Sometimes we want to plot summaries
based on different levels of
aggregation. Different layers might
have different group aesthetics, so
that some display individual level
data while others display summaries of
larger groups.</p>
<p>Building on the previous example,
suppose we want to add a single smooth
line to the plot just created, based
on the ages and heights of all the
boys. If we use the same grouping for
the smooth that we used for the line,
we get the first plot in Figure 4.4.</p>
<p>p + geom_smooth(aes(group = Subject),
method=&quot;lm&quot;, se = F)</p>
<p>This is not what we wanted; we have
inadvertently added a smoothed line
for each boy. This new layer needs a
different group aesthetic, group = 1,
so that the new line will be based on
all the data, as shown in the second
plot in the figure. The modified layer
looks like this:</p>
<p>p + geom_smooth(aes(group = 1),
method=&quot;lm&quot;, size = 2, se = F)</p>
<p>[...] Using aes(group = 1) in the
smooth layer fits a single line of
best fit across all boys.&quot;</p>

<p>If you use jQuery 1.4.x you should verify whether the jqModal.js contain <code>$()</code> (for example <code>{$()[t](""keypress"",m)[t](""keydown"",m)[t](""mousedown"",m);}</code> in <a href=""http://dev.iceburg.net/jquery/jqModal/jqModal.js"" rel=""nofollow"">jqModal.js</a>). This can not be used together with jQuery 1.4.x. To fix the problem replace <code>$()</code> to <code>$(document)</code>.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED</strong>: After you post the link to site having the problem I could analyse the problem.

<p>How one can see the form element has <code>onclick</code> and <code>onsubmit</code> attributes which produce at the end the error.

How you can see in <a href=""http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/mvc/1.0/MicrosoftMvcAjax.debug.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/mvc/1.0/MicrosoftMvcAjax.debug.js</a> (uncompressed version of the <a href=""http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/mvc/1.0/MicrosoftMvcAjax.js"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/mvc/1.0/MicrosoftMvcAjax.js</a> which you use) it has <code>Sys.Mvc.AsyncForm.handleSubmit</code> but <strong>no</strong> <code>Sys.Mvc.AsyncForm.handleClick</code> function. It would be easy if you will use the MicrosoftMvcAjax.js from your current MVC project (probably MVC 2.0) because on the <a href=""http://www.asp.net/ajaxlibrary/CDN.ashx"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft Ajax CDN</a> you would not find MVC 2.0. More better would be create the dialog with respect of jQuery only without any MVC controls.</p>

<p>It is the main error, but there are some other small problems in your code. For example you should remove comma before '}' from the following code fragment</p>

<p>Next problem is: your code has two elements having id=""jqmWindowContainer"".</p>

<p>Your code has lines</p>

<pre><code>&lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" type=""text/css"" media=""screen""
      href=""http://camp.matrix6.com/content/css/jqModal.css"" /&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript""
        src=""http://camp.matrix6.com/Content/js/jqModal.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>in the middle of the HTML code. It is not allowed. The <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element should be moved inside of the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>. Moreover you include the code with <code>&lt;link href="".../jqModal.css""&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script src="".../jqModal.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code> <strong>twice</strong> on one page which is also very bad. You should not load jqModal.js twice on the same page. If you move the code to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> you can place it only once.</p>

<p>I can continue with less important errors to hold XHTML 1.0 Strict which you use. For example you should place <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code> elements inside of <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> over <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and so on. I recommend you validate your page in <a href=""http://validator.w3.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://validator.w3.org/</a>.</p>

"3992448","<p>I've subclasses UIControl and in it I am sending:</p>

<pre><code>[starView addTarget:self action:@selector(starRatingChanged:) forControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];

<p>The view shows up fine, and without the target being there the functionality works well. But with adding the target, it crashes. Any ideas why?</p>

<p>My class is declared with:</p>

<p>For what it is worth, I set up my view in <code>- (void)layoutSubviews</code>. Is there another method that I need to subclass in order for the targets to be saved properly or for the targets to be sent the right actions? I thought UIControl handled saving the targets and actions for you.</p>

    NSLog(@""sendActionsForControlEvents"");
    [self sendActionsForControlEvents:UIControlEventValueChanged];

<p>And the function that should be called (and it is in the header too):</p>

<pre><code>- (void)starRatingChanged:(id)sender {
    NSLog(@""star rating changed"");

<hr>

<p>Yep - just a matter of getting the right scale_colour_ layer figured out.  Try:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(timeSeries, aes(x = Date, y = Unique.Visitors, colour = Revenue)) +
    geom_point() +
    stat_smooth() +
    scale_y_continuous(formatter = comma) +
    scale_colour_continuous(formatter = comma)
</code></pre>

<p>I personally would also move my the colour mapping to the geom_point layer, so that it doesn't give you that odd line behind the dot in the legend:</p>

<pre><code>ggplot(timeSeries, aes(x = Date, y = Unique.Visitors)) +
    geom_point(aes(colour = Revenue)) +
    stat_smooth() +
    scale_y_continuous(formatter = comma) +

"3993782","<p>I have two tables in my application.  The first one, Sections, stores content for a specific section of an online publication.  This contains (among other things) the section title and a field CurrentRevisionId (FK).</p>

<p>A second table, Revisions, stores different revisions of that content.  It has PK RevisionId field (the FK above, used to denote current revision), the HTML content itself, and SectionId (FK), specifying which Section the revision belongs to.</p>

<p>So basically I've got these two FKs pointing to each other.  When I create a new Section, the child entity CurrentRevision is also populated with that content.  But the InsertOnSubmit fails with this error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The INSERT statement conflicted with the FOREIGN KEY constraint ""FK_Sections_Revisions"". The conflict occurred in database ""xxxx"", table ""xxxx.Sections"", column 'SectionID'. The statement has been terminated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My guess is that it can't simultaneously create both rows and populate them with each other's PKs.</p>

<p>Should I insert the Section first, then the Revision (along with Section's PK), and then update the Section with the Revision PK?  Or is there a better / more elegant solution to this?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  I've attached a screencap of the two tables with their relationships.  Each Section has many Revisions (FK SectionID inside of Revisions table).  Additionally, there is a one-to-one relationship where the CurrentRevisionId field in Section points to the revision which is ""current"".  This ""current"" revision is where the application pulls the HTML from.  Hope that clears things up a bit.</p>

In this way SQL is already doing the recursive calls, so why redo this in your application code.</p>

<p>In this way, your method can then be simplified to just multiplying the <code>TreeLevel</code> by the amount of pixels to give the correct indentation. No need for recursion. Simply loop through the resultant model.</p>

<p>In any case, I think you will have more value of having each items TreeLevel because you could possibly do other things like 'give me an overview of all root nodes' resulting in rows where <code>Number</code> equals 1, 2 and 3</p>

<pre><code>TreeLevel Number  Other_data

<p>Other notes concerning your original code - use the the TagBuilder classes when constructing HTML from code. IMO, that will be much cleaner and better. No magic strings building..</p>

"3994468","<p>""TreeNode.IsVisible"" is available but I can't tell from it whether it's visible or partially visible - ""true if the tree node is visible or partially visible"".</p>

<p>e.g. How can I tell if the following ""Temporary ASP.NET"" tree node is partially visible?</p>

<p>Also, how the text hovers directly over the node is called? Is it a tooltip in the end? Can it be controled on visibility?</p>

<p>Lastly as a failsafe you can set <code>white-space: nowrap;</code> but this should be a failsafe for funky font size issues and such not your primary solution because it will introduce complications of horizontal scroll bars etc.</p>

"3997454","<p>I'm cross-posting this from <a href=""https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/7499/help-me-understand-linearly-separability-in-a-binary-svm"">math.stackexchange.com</a> because I'm not getting any feedback and it's a time-sensitive question for me.</p>

<hr>

<p>My question pertains to linear separability with hyperplanes in a support vector machine.</p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machineclassifier."" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>...formally, a support vector machine
  constructs a hyperplane or set of
  hyperplanes in a high or infinite
  dimensional space, which can be used
  for classification, regression or
  other tasks. Intuitively, a good
  separation is achieved by the
  hyperplane that has the largest
  distance to the nearest training data
  points of any class (so-called
  functional margin), since in general
  the larger the margin the lower the
  generalization error of the
  classifier.classifier.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The linear separation of classes by hyperplanes intuitively makes sense to me. And I think I understand linear separability for two-dimensional geometry. However, I'm implementing an SVM using a popular SVM library (libSVM) and when messing around with the numbers, I fail to understand how an SVM can create a curve between classes, or enclose central points in category 1 within a circular curve when surrounded by points in category 2 if a hyperplane in an n-dimensional space V is a ""flat"" subset of dimension n − 1, or for two-dimensional space - a 1D line.</p>

<h2>Here is what I mean:</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/wqZMd.png"" alt=""circularly enclosed class separation for a 2D binary SVM""></p>

<p>That's not a hyperplane. That's circular. How does this work? Or are there more dimensions inside the SVM than the two-dimensional 2D input features?</p>

<hr>

<p>This example application can be downloaded <a href=""http://www.matthewajohnson.org/software/svm.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2><strong>Edit:</strong></h2>

<p>Thanks for your comprehensive answers. So the SVM can separate weird data well by using a kernel function. Would it help to linearize the data before sending it to the SVM? For example, one of my input features (a numeric value) has a turning point (eg. 0) where it neatly fits into category 1, but above and below zero it fits into category 2. Now, because I know this, would it help classification to send the absolute value of this feature for the SVM?</p>

"3997873","<p>In learning WPF, I (perhaps unwisely) chose to display my XML data (wisely parsed with LINQ) in a TreeView. But when I load it into a TreeView, it looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/M2IfD.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The XAML is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TreeView Name=""StoryTree""&gt;
    &lt;TreeViewItem Name=""TreeGeneral"" Header=""General""/&gt;
    &lt;TreeViewItem Name=""TreeCharacters"" Header=""Characters"" /&gt;
    &lt;TreeViewItem Name=""TreeEvents"" Header=""Events"" /&gt;
    &lt;TreeViewItem Name=""TreeFactions"" Header=""Factions"" /&gt;
    &lt;TreeViewItem Name=""TreeLocations"" Header=""Locations"" /&gt;
    &lt;TreeViewItem Name=""TreePlots"" Header=""Plots"" /&gt;
    &lt;TreeViewItem Name=""TreeReferences"" Header=""References"" /&gt;
    &lt;TreeViewItem Name=""TreeScenes"" Header=""Scenes"" /&gt;
&lt;/TreeView&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In the code-behind, I load the items into the treeview with a simple routine as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    private void Update(StoryItem[] items, TreeViewItem parentNode)
    {
        //  Suppress updating if there are no actual changes.
        if (Changed(items, parentNode))
        {

            //  Remove all items from the child node.
            ClearItem(parentNode);

            //  Reinsert the child nodes.
            foreach (var item in items)
            {
                //  Create a TreeViewItem and insert it into the TreeView.
                //  Note that the item must support double clicking so that the 
                //  user can open the item. Also, we want to support tooltips
                //  for the items so that the summary text (if any) will display
                //  when the user hovers over the item with the mouse.
                TreeViewItem treeItem = new TreeViewItem();
                TextBlock block = new TextBlock();
                block.Text = item.Name;
                block.ToolTip = item.Summary;
                block.TextTrimming = TextTrimming.WordEllipsis;
                treeItem.Items.Add(block);
                parentNode.Items.Add(treeItem);
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I kind of suspect that this is the ""cascading style inheritance"" in WPF, but I'm not entirely sure (the top-level nodes look fine), but it might be something about the way I'm creating the child nodes. </p>

<p>DISCLAIMER:
Please don't delve into talks about binding the treeview. For this particular app, the data is <em>NEVER</em> going to consist of more than a category header (top-level nodes) and the items immediately below them. What I want to know is <em>why</em> the top level nodes look fine and the ones I created are different from them. </p>

<pre><code>        foreach (var item in items)

  <p>You can also control which type of keyboard
  is displayed when a user touches a text field in a web page. To
  display a telephone keypad, an email keyboard, or a URL keyboard, use
  the tel, email, or url keywords for the type attribute on an input
  element, respectively. To display a numeric keyboard, set the value of
  the pattern attribute to ""[0-9]<em>"" or ""\d</em>"".</p>
  
  <p>These keywords and the pattern attribute are part of HTML 5, and are
  available in iOS 3.1 and later. The following list shows how to
  display each type of keyboard, including the standard keyboard.</p>

"4000903","<p>So I am trying to suppress a specific bar on my bar graph. So instead of populating the graph from the database, I am populating it from a formula field. So in my formula field, I have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if field &lt;&gt; ""Member"" then
formula = field
</code></pre>

<p>So it gets rid of the field however it leaves me with this:</p>

"4001571","<p>I have a stored procedure that is called by data collection <strong>system</strong>.</p>

<p>The procedure has many parameters that for the collected data. </p>

<p>I'm using the INFORMATION_SCHEMA to pull the parameter list into a temp table </p>

<pre>
    SELECT substring(PARAMETER_NAME , 2 , len(PARAMETER_NAME ) - 1) 'SpParam', PARAMETER_NAME, DATA_TYPE
    INTO #tempParam
    FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PARAMETERS
    WHERE SPECIFIC_NAME='InsertB2ChamberData'   
</pre>  

<p>From there I can insert any missing data tag names in my tag list table</p>

<pre>
    INSERT INTO ToolTag
    SELECT @ToolID, @ToolTagTypeID, SpParam, 'Default Description', GETDATE()
    FROM #tempParam
    WHERE spParam NOT IN (SELECT ToolTagName FROM ToolTag WHERE ToolID = @ToolID)
</pre>

<p>So far so good, now I would like to use the ToolTag and the temp table list to insert the data from each parameter. Initial I though some dynamic SQL would do the trick. </p>

<pre>
    DECLARE tag CURSOR FOR 
    SELECT t.ToolTagID, p.PARAMETER_NAME, p.DATA_TYPE
    FROM ToolTag t
        JOIN #tempParam p
            ON t.ToolTagName = p.SpParam

    OPEN tag

    FETCH NEXT FROM tag INTO @TagID, @Parameter, @DataType

    WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
    BEGIN

        SELECT @Cindex = CHARINDEX('char', @DataType)
        IF @Cindex  0
        begin

            SELECT @sql = 
            N'INSERT INTO ToolTagData VALUES('+convert(varchar(10),@TagID)+', '+convert(varchar(10),@ToolDataEventID)+', '+ @Parameter +', 0)'

        end

        EXEC(@sql)

        FETCH NEXT FROM tag INTO @TagID, @Parameter, @DataType
    END

    CLOSE tag
    DEALLOCATE tag
</pre>

<p>Of course the above doesn't work as the @sql statement ends up with something like this:</p>

<p>INSERT INTO ToolTagData VALUES(315, 50, @ShutterPosition, 0)</p>

<p>As opposed to the @ShutterPosition parameter value. I'm stuck here, I could so some kind of brute force with each name, but I'd like to be able to be abstract and have re-usability for other procedures. </p>

<p>So is there any way out this, or am I barking up the wrong tree with this approach?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
My Schema looks like this:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/yt2dZ.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The goal is to insert one record into ToolTagData Data for each stored procedure parameter. The key into ToolTag is the name of the stored procedure parameter. </p>

<p>The hope is that tags are added to the ToolTag table simply by adding a new parameter to procedure.</p>

<p>I'm limited by what the third party data acquisition program can do, so this an attempt abstract the process. </p>

<p>A KTSP tour is just an ordinary tour starting and ending in the same given arbitrary point but subject to two more constraints:
(1)It passes every type of point one and only once.
(2)The type of point the path passes has order. That is, it first starts from point V<sub>0</sub>, then first passes type T1 point, then type T2 point, then type T3 point, and so on until it passes type T<sub>K</sub> point, after which it comes back at V<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p>Here is my question:<br />
when the point location V<sub>0</sub> is given find the shortest KTSP tour.</p>

One way to find this is to use the palm-log tool in the SDK to dump out the output with your app id and see if anything is reported from V8.  You also can use the web-based Ares Log tool at <a href=""http://ares.palm.com/AresLog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ares.palm.com/AresLog/</a>.</p>

<p>If there are no syntax errors, then this happens when you don't push an initial scene, so there's nothing telling the System Manager that it's ready to show the app's card.</p>

"4005097","<p>I am currently developing a game in which a player plays slot machine.The game is based on that the user stops in money, 100sek, 300sek or 500sek. Then the user makes a bet for each game. The one-armed bandit randomly spits out 3 different symbols in nine pieces fields. See figure:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/7wPwK.jpg"" alt=""alt text"">
The goal of the game is to obtain as many rows, columns, and diagonals as possible of the same symbol. In the above example that I made, obtained a profit when the upper and lower line have equal symbols, 2 simbles of the same in a row (aaa). 
The following profit system is depending on the number of rows with the same symbol as:  </p>

<p>•A series provides 2 * bet  </p>

<p>•Two lines giving 3 * bet</p>

<p>•Three rows giving 4 * bet</p>

<p>Four rows gives 5 * bet</p>

<p>•Five lines gives 7 * bet</p>

<p>•Fully playing field gives 10 * bet</p>

  it to the form instance. It will

"4011211","<p>I have an EF4 Model that is built with abstract entities/classes:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/yYZTI.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Notice how <strong>State</strong> entity has a navigational property called <strong>Country</strong>.</p>

<p>Note: I have lazy-loading disabled, so i must eager-load on demand.</p>

<p>Now, if i have the following method:</p>

<pre><code>public Location FindSingle(int id)
{
   return _repository.Find().WithId(id).SingleOrDefault();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This does not return any associations by default. But how can i <em>dynamically</em> eager-load the associations when i explicitly want to?</p>

<p>I cannot do this:</p>

<pre><code>return _repository.Find().WithId(id).Include(""Country"").SingleOrDefault();
</code></pre>

<p>As i am working with an abstract class called <strong>Location</strong>, which does not have a navigational property called ""Country"". I do not <em>know</em> what the derived type is until i actually execute the query with <code>.SingleOrDefault</code>.</p>

<p>So, here's what i've had to do:</p>

<pre><code>public Location FindSingle(int id, bool includeAssociations = false)
{
    var location = _repository.Find().WithId(id).SingleOrDefault();
    return includeAssociations
                       ? LoadAssociation(location)
                       : location;
}

private Location LoadAssociation(Location location)
{
   // test derived-type, e.g:
   var state = location as State;

   if (state != null) 
      return _repository.Find().OfType&lt;State&gt;().Include(""Country"").WithId(id).SingleOrDefault();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, i'm doing 2 identical calls. Does it work? Yes. Is it pretty? No, and it's not really ""eager-loading"".</p>

<p>I know this is not the correct solution, can you guys think of the proper one? (and yes i know i can use stored procedures, but i really want to go through my repository/model here, so the entities are correctly attached to the graph, ready for editing).</p>

<p>Even though <code>.Include</code> causes a Left Outer Join, the problem is i'm working off the ""Locations"" entity set. I need to <code>.Include</code> on the ""State"", but ""States"" belong to the ""Locations"" entity set (derived classes belong to their parent's entity set).</p>

<p>So i guess my question is actually pretty generic - <strong>how do we do a .Include on a child of an abstract entity, when we don't know what the child is beforehand?</strong></p>

<p>Remember, i cannot use <code>.OfType&lt;T&gt;()</code> first (and then the .Include on the derived type), as i don't know what T is (and neither does the calling code), hence generics cannot be utilized here.</p>
","Entity Framework 4 Abstract Model - How to Programatically Eager-Load Navigational Properties?","<c#><linq-to-entities><entity-framework-4><abstract-class><eager-loading>","2010-10-25 00:39:12","1973","4011766","1","<p>The real issue here is that you are holding an <code>Id</code> but you don't know what it represents: it could be for a <code>Country</code> or for a <code>State</code>.  At some time you presumably did know what it was, but you didn't maintain that information.</p>

<p>After loading a <code>Location</code> from the repository, how do you know which type to cast it to in order to access the relevant relationship property on it?  Presumably you have to use <code>as</code> or <code>is</code> with cast and then you can access these properties.  Again that kinda smells bad.</p>

<p>The best option here would be to maintain both the <code>Type</code> and the <code>Id</code> of a Location object so you can reload it using the appropriate repository method.</p>

<p>Another option would be to instead move the relationship up to the <code>Location</code> class so that every <code>Location</code> object has a <code>.Parent</code> Location and a <code>.Children</code> Locations collection.  Now you can include them in your <code>Include</code> and when you find you have a <code>State</code> you know to look at <code>.Parent</code> and when you have a <code>Country</code> you know to look at <code>.Children</code>.  Use null for no parent and an empty collection for no children.  Now when you add continents or cities to your Location class you'll be in great shape to use the same model.</p>

<p>A final option which you can sometimes use in situations like this is to Union two queries after converting them to the common base type, e.g. something like:-</p>

<pre><code>context.Locations.OfType&lt;Country&gt;().Include(""States"").Cast&lt;Location&gt;().Union(context.Locations.OfType&lt;State&gt;().Include(""Countries).Cast&lt;Location&gt;());

"4014709","<p>I have a very odd problem, hopefully easily solved.</p>

<p>I am drawing a quad as a triangle strip. It simply has 2 triangles in the strip and I apply a texture containing an alpha channel to it. </p>

<p>For one of the triangles it seems the alpha is fine and exactly as I want it however for the first triangle it looks as though the alpha is either 1.0 or 0.0, rather than the correct in-between values.</p>

<p>What could be causing this? Have I assumed correctly that that's the problem? I shall attach an image so people can see what I mean:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/xzJWm.png"" alt=""Alpha problem""></p>

<p>The weird thing is this is drawn as a triangle array and from 1 texture so I am unsure how I can change settings or affect the texture in some way. I thought maybe the triangle was being drawn in a different rotation but they are both anti-clockwise.</p>

<p>Code wise drawn like so:</p>

<pre><code>    gl.glBindTexture(GL10.GL_TEXTURE_2D, texturePointer);
    //Enable the vertices buffer for writing and to be used during our rendering
    gl.glEnableClientState(GL10.GL_VERTEX_ARRAY);
    //Specify the location and data format of an array of vertex coordinates to use when rendering
    gl.glVertexPointer(3, GL10.GL_FLOAT, 0, vertexBuffer);

    //Enable the texture buffer
    gl.glEnableClientState(GL10.GL_TEXTURE_COORD_ARRAY);
    gl.glTexCoordPointer(2, GL10.GL_FLOAT, 0, textureBuffer);

    gl.glDrawElements(GL10.GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, indices.length, GL10.GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, indexBuffer);
</code></pre>

<p>So I am a little stumped if I'm honest.</p>

<p>Edit: Looking at this a bit more it's as though one of the triangles is being textured twice so the alpha obviously adds up and it gets a bit more applied. This probably means I'm doing something wrong with my triangle strip. I make the strip like so (started hand writing it out to check..):</p>

<pre><code>//Top left
    vertices[vertPlace++] = 0.0f;
    vertices[vertPlace++] = height;
    vertices[vertPlace++] = 0.0f;

    //Bottom left
    vertices[vertPlace++] = 0.0f;
    vertices[vertPlace++] = 0.0f;
    vertices[vertPlace++] = 0.0f;

    //top right
    vertices[vertPlace++] = width;
    vertices[vertPlace++] = height;
    vertices[vertPlace++] = 0.0f;

    //Bottom right
    vertices[vertPlace++] = width;
    vertices[vertPlace++] = 0.0f;
    vertices[vertPlace++] = 0.0f;

    //Now set the indices
    indices[indiPlace++] = (short)0;
    indices[indiPlace++] = (short)1;
    indices[indiPlace++] = (short)2;
    indices[indiPlace++] = (short)3;

    //Top Left
    textureCoords[textPlace++] = 0.0f;
    textureCoords[textPlace++] = 1.0f;

    ///Bottom left
    textureCoords[textPlace++] = 0.0f;
    textureCoords[textPlace++] = 0.0f;

I can't seem to find anything online that's even close either. I'd sure appreciate being pointed in the right direction!!</p>

&lt;/div&gt;

<p>And this is how we show it:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#div-dialog-warning"").dialog({
    title: t,
    resizable: false,
    height: 160,
    modal: true,
    buttons: {
        ""Ok"" : function () {
            $(this).dialog(""close"");

As you can see I tried to set the width of the Labels explicitly to force them to be smaller and therefore next to each other in the menu bar.</p>

<p>In general, you should style the outermost component (container) which will then position all of its children accordingly. As a side not, this layout would be achieved using just a single (or pair, depending on exactly what you're trying to do) or <code>FrameLayout</code>s, which would significantly reduce the layout overhead. While there's nothing <em>wrong</em> with <code>LinearLayout</code>, it <em>is</em> surprisingly computationally expensive.</p>

<p>I'm exploring the idea of using an android phone to SMS or robot talk a pin/token code to a user's home phone or mobile device. I'm looking at using android because the hardware would be cheap and I'll be able to install the application I'd make with no issues. </p>

<p>User's should be logging onto the system about once a day. The application currently has 75 users. User's are not guaranteed to have a cell phone.</p>

<p>I have a few questions:<br>
Is this a viable 2nd form of authentication?<br>
Is there a cheaper way of accomplishing this?</p>

<p>The workflow is as follows.</p>

<p>User goes to webapp enters user name, selects type of notification they want, SMS or Speech and submits.  </p>

<p>The webapp (in my case C# .net) verifies the user exists and looks up the phone number we have on record.  </p>

<p>The web app creates a token that will expire in a set amount of time and somehow communicates this and the phone number to the android device. (XML, files or anything really)</p>

<p>The android phone has an application that checks the XML file or folder containing files with the information on a set interval and performs a SMS or phones the person and tells them the token with the robot voice.</p>

<p>The phone then notifies the webapp that the message was sent or failed and the webapp notifies the user.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of what I'm thinking.
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/y8dtU.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

","Using SMS as an authentication factor for a website","<android><authentication><mobile-phones>","2010-10-25 22:47:55","582","4025741","2","<p>You can do this for SMS, but not for a voice recording.  You also probably don't want to... but I'll get to that in a moment.</p>

<p>To get the android phone to do things as the delegate of your webserver, you probably want to enable usb debugging on the phone, then use the adb tool to set up a port forward so that a particular local port on the web server forwards to a port on the phone, where you will have a service listening.  Keeping that service running may be a little tricky as android is really designed around user-interactive applications, but it probably can be done, especially if you root the phone and launch a native executable with its OOM killer values set to protect it.</p>

<p>You cannot play recorded voice messages into the call audio on today's android phones because the in-call audio bypasses the linux subsystem and is handled instead by the other (radio, etc) processor core.  You might be able to do something with a headset cable wired to loopback... but this is getting extreme.</p>

<p>Probably an android phone is not the solution to your application problem... you are going to be dependent on the cell network, on maintaining a plan, and your carrier might allege some grounds for objection.</p>

<p>I think it would be far more appropriate to look into using an sms gateway service, and probably a voip gateway service if the user elects voice notification.  Probably someone is already selling a solution to your complete problem.</p>

","visualvm monitors memory usage","<java><memory-leaks><visualvm>","2010-10-26 04:45:19","3290","4023489","1","<p>What I believe you see here is the concurrent Garbage Collector is doing young generation cleanups, but the heap is constantly churning so it can't get a hold of all the references for an old generation collection.  When you hit the perform GC button you're doing a ""stop-the-world"" collection which blocks all the threads, freezing the heap, and allowing a much larger collection to occur.  My main concerns here would be - does a large collection ever occur (after x hours)?  Are you seeing OutOfMemory errors with a smaller heap?</p>

<p>1) Do you have the auto refresh button turned on?  It may also be that profiler does a small GC (Eden space) before taking a snapshot.</p>

<p>2)  This is perfectly normal.  Garbage collection takes time and resources (processor cycles).  If you've set your heap to a large size, it will wait until it reaches some percentage of that until triggering a garbage collection itself.  I think the default free space to live object ratio is between 40% and 70%  I know tomcat specifically changed the way it does garbage collection around version 5, tomcat v4 had performance issues because it spent a lot of time running the garbage collector.  You may want to do some research here and see if tomcat has custom garbage collection options.</p>

<p>3)  No.  A nearly full heap is exactly what you're striving for.  It may make sense to make the heap smaller so that a full garbage collection doesn't take such a long time.  It's trade-off between lots of garbage collections (pauses) and lengthy garbage collections (long pauses).  Each app is different, so I generally start with the defaults and tweak as needed.   There are lots of options for garbage collection (and alternate collectors) if you're interested.</p>

"4021259","<p>I'm in the middle of a project teaching the basics of OpenGL. I've got most of the requirements working fine in terms of camera rotation, translation etc. However I'm struggling a lot with the lighting.</p>

<p>This picture is a comparison of my current program (left) vs the sample solution (right).
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/amADf.jpg"" alt=""current program compared to sample solution""></p>

<p>In case you can't tell, I'm getting very monochrome colours on the truck. The shadows are very sharp and dark, the high points are singly coloured instead of specular.
The project calls for the use of textures; the one I've shown here is a basic texture of plain grey pixels but i could use any texture (including the beach sand one being used for the ground).
I'm drawing the object from a mesh:</p>

<pre><code>GLfloat ambient[] = {0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 1};
GLfloat diffuse[] = {0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 1};
GLfloat specular[] = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0};
GLfloat shine = 100.0;

glMaterialfv(GL_FRONT, GL_AMBIENT, ambient);
glMaterialfv(GL_FRONT, GL_DIFFUSE, diffuse);
glMaterialfv(GL_FRONT, GL_SPECULAR, specular);
glMaterialf(GL_FRONT, GL_SHININESS, shine);

glEable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, textureNumber);
glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES);

for (int i = 0; i &lt; meshes[n]-&gt;nTriangles; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++) {
        glNormal3fv(mesh -&gt; normals[mesh-&gt;triangles[i][j]]);
        glTexCoord2fv(mesh-&gt;texCoords[mesh-&gt;triangles[i][j]]);
        glVertex3fv(mesh -&gt; vertices[mesh-&gt;triangles[i][j]]);
    }
}
glEnd();
</code></pre>

<p>There is one light in the scene:</p>

<pre><code>glEnable(GL_LIGHTING);
glEnable(GL_LIGHT0);
glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST)


GLfloat diffuse0[]={1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0};
GLfloat ambient0[]={1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0};
GLfloat specular0[]={1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0};
GLfloat light0_pos[]={1.0, 1.0, 1,0, 1.0};

glLightfv(GL_LIGHT0, GL_POSITION, light0_pos);
glLightfv(GL_LIGHT0, GL_AMBIENT, ambient0);
glLightfv(GL_LIGHT0, GL_DIFFUSE, diffuse0);
glLightfv(GL_LIGHT0, GL_SPECULAR, specular0);

glLightf(GL_LIGHT0, GL_CONSTANT_ATTENUATION, 2.0);
glLightf(GL_LIGHT0, GL_LINEAR_ATTENUATION, 1.0);
glLightf(GL_LIGHT0, GL_QUADRATIC_ATTENUATION, 2.0);
</code></pre>

<p>Is there something major that I'm missing that could be causing this severe difference? Particular values I should play with? Or a <code>glEnable</code> call I've missed?
Any help, advice or pointers to elsewhere much appreciated.</p>
","OpenGL Lighting struggles","<c><opengl>","2010-10-26 06:37:10","967","4022494","2","<p>To eliminate the sharp drop-off, amp up the ambient light. There's no global illumination model in OpenGL so that parameter has absolutely no effect beyond being the colour the face will be if no other light falls upon it.</p>

<p>Since you're using glVertex-type calls, I'll go out on a limb and guess you're using the fixed functionality pipeline? If so then lighting is calculated at vertices, then interpolated across polygon surfaces. That means that specular highlights don't work very well on 'large' polygons — roughly speaking, the highlight can't appear in the middle of a polygon. GPUs with programmable pipelines (which includes the ones in mobile phones nowadays) can calculate lighting per pixel instead of per vertex but OpenGL doesn't do this for you, so you'd need to delve into shader programming yourself. Or just ensure that your model is made up of small enough polygons.</p>

<p>Your shininess exponent is also quite high - have you tried dialling that down a few notches?</p>

"4021318","<p>I am doing the design of a small project where I didn't use programming against interfaces for all my classes. I found that some classes would hardly ever be needed to change, so I let them be referenced by their client classes as concrete classes.</p>

<li>You can change the way A works to not use B at all without breaking calling code.</li>
<li>Encapsulation - no one gets to tamper with B from the outside while A is running</li>

<p>Which I'm aware is not quite that impressive (given that there are tools that can be used to develop way smoother and more detailed little games like this one in a tenth of the time), but it was made for learning, and developing my notions in 3D development and spacial concepts.</p>

<p>As I'm learning Java recently, and I'm wondering: are there tools to work with 3D just as easily as in what is provided in WPF ?</p>

<p>For those who don't know: WPF provides the possiblity to create 3d objects, cameras, light, faces and render them (through the camera's view), and this little test game was made with fixed cubes and a camera that moves using user interaction. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Not a dupe, it's not about Java equivalent for WPF, i'm asking specifically about the WPF's 3D functionalities.</p>

<p>If you wish to try out other iAd designs that you are building, you need to grab the iAd JS framework from the iOS Dev Center.  This will install an iAd Tester application in the Simulator which allows you to test iAd builds.</p>

"4027164","<p>I have some code that inserts data into some tables (one table has a FILESTREAM column) and then calls SubmitChanges after it is done.</p>

<pre><code>db.Log = new System.IO.StreamWriter(@""c:\windows\temp\linq.log"") { AutoFlush = true };
db.SubmitChanges(ConflictMode.FailOnFirstConflict);
</code></pre>

<p>I have referenced the following links but they appear to not be my issue:</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3441241/linq-to-sql-submitchanges-does-not-work"">LINQ to SQL: SubmitChanges() does not work?</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/206532/linq-not-updating-on-submitchanges"">LINQ not updating on .SubmitChanges()</a></p>

<p>Each table has a primary key.
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/UyIi0.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I have 14 tables and I see 14 IsPrimaryKey=true contained in the linq.designer.cs</p>

<p>Though I do see that ""AutoSync=AutoSync.OnInsert"" is missing from the Files table but I think that is because IDENTITY is not set (using guid as primary key).</p>

<p>When I check the database, nothing was inserted into it. The linq.log shows:</p>

<p>When I look at Server Profiler it records RPC:Completed exec sp_executesql ""Good Insert Statement""</p>

<p>When I run the sql manually through Server Manager Studio, everything works fine. I can do that successfully either by logging in with SA or with the credentials used by the web service.</p>

<p>LINQ SubmitChanges is not throwing an error though. Any reason why it is not working? I have not overloaded any Insert/Update/DeleteFile functions in any partial classes.</p>

<p>Modifying other tables seem to work fine though. I am wondering if it has to do with the FILESTREAM column.</p>

<p>My connection string is:</p>

<pre><code>Data Source=IP;Initial Catalog=MyDB;User ID=myLogin;Password=myPswd
</code></pre>

<p>Once I manually put the record into the table (FILESTREAM table), I can read that data just fine.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have FILESTREAM configured for Transact-SQL access and not for file i/o streaming access. From how I understood it, I didn't see a need to have a shared folder to the data location. I wanted everything to go through the database to get to the FILESTREAM data.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>FIXED</p>

<p>I have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>public TransactionScope CreateTransactionScope(TransactionScopeOption scope, IsolationLevel level)
{
  var transactionOptions = new TransactionOptions();
  transactionOptions.IsolationLevel = level;
  transactionOptions.Timeout = TimeSpan.MaxValue;
  return new TransactionScope(scope, transactionOptions);
}
public TransactionScope CreateTransactionScope(TransactionScopeOption scope)
{
  return CreateTransactionScope(scope, IsolationLevel.ReadCommitted);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and my submitchanges looked like:</p>

<pre><code>using (var ts = db.CreateTransactionScope(TransactionScopeOption.RequiresNew, IsolationLevel.ReadUncommitted))
    {
      db.SubmitChanges(ConflictMode.FailOnFirstConflict);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>anyone? anyone? I forgot the complete statement... lol. I was thinking that I might add more in the submitchanges area and might want to rollback so I left the using statement there but never commit my changes... Thanks everyone!</p>

"4029541","<p>Folks,</p>

<p>In a nutshell, I want to replicate this dialog:

<p>It's a Visual Studio 2010 ASP.Net MVC project.  If I execute this command, I get all the files I want, including the transformed web.configs in the ""C:\ToDeploy"" directory.</p>

<p>I want to replicate this on the command line so I can use it for a QA environment build.</p>

<p>I've seen various articles on how to do this on the command line for Remote Deploys, but I just want to do it for File System deploys.</p>

<p>I know I could replicate this functionality using nAnt tasks or rake scripts, but I want to do it using this mechanism so I'm not repeating myself.</p>

<p>I've investigated this some more, and I've found these links, but none of them solve it cleanly:</p>

<ul>

<p>The command line you need is:</p>

<pre><code>msbuild path/to/your/webdirectory/YourWeb.csproj /p:Configuration=Debug;DeployOnBuild=True;PackageAsSingleFile=False
</code></pre>

<p>You can change where the project outputs to by adding a property of <code>outdir=c:\wherever\</code> in the /p: section.</p>

<p>This will create the output at:</p>

<pre><code>path/to/your/webdirectory/obj/Debug/Package/PackageTmp/

<p>You can then copy those files from the above directory using whatever method you'd like.</p>

<p>Another wrinkle I found was that it was putting in Tokenized Parameters into the Web.config.  If you don't need that feature, make sure you add:</p>

<p>Define a RelativeLayout like this one.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;RelativeLayout xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
  android:layout_width=""fill_parent""

    android:text=""@string/hello""/&gt;
  &lt;ImageButton android:id=""@+id/clear""

    android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
    android:src=""@drawable/icon""
    android:layout_alignRight=""@id/edittext""/&gt;
&lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now what happens. The ImageButton gets drawn on top of the EditText. We set its right edge to be equal to the right edge of the EditTexts in order to get it appear on the right side.</p>

<p>Now you have to assign your ImageButton an OnCLickListener with if overridden method to just set the EditTexts text to a empty string like that.</p>

<pre><code>EditText editText = null;
ImageButton clear = null;

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.clear);

    editText = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.edittext);
    clear = (ImageButton) findViewById(R.id.clear);

    clear.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
        public void onClick(View v) {
            editText.setText("""");
        }
});
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Now here we simply tell our ImageViews OnClickListener to reset our EditTexts text upon a click. Simple as that. ;)</p>

<p>Of course my example uses not very aesthetic images but you can fine tune the images yourself. The principle works.</p>

"4033531","<p>I've looked all over and haven't been able to find a clear answer to a seemingly common question: How can I do two-way databinding over a many-to-many relationship in ASP.net?</p>

<p>I have the following database structure:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/E1uRy.png"" alt=""LINQ Diagram""></p>

<p>I am currently writing a page for editing or adding a User record. Databinding things such as name and password is simple, but what I really need it to be able to display a list of all PhoneGroups and choose one or more from the list. How do I do this?</p>

<p>I tried a CheckBoxList, but while I can display the list of PhoneGroups, How do I bind the Checked state of each box based on whether the user has access? Some solutions use a loop in the OnDataBound event of the CheckBoxList. If I do this, how do I update the database when the checked state changes? I could go the brute force approach and write code to do this, but isn't there something that can make this simpler? It seems like such a common scenario.</p>

<p>I am currently using <a href=""http://www.devart.com/linqconnect/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Devart's LinqConnect</a>, but I am open to change. The backend database is MySQL.</p>

<p>It is fairly simple when you consdier what the code is doing int he background. You could write your own custom server control, but thats a lot more difficult.</p>

<p>MVC may offer you an alternative ...</p>

<p>really why not redesign and only return the objects that they ahve permission for?
as for updating items in the database you need to say more about the architecture. But ultimatley to update an item you have to take the new item ... you have to do womthing like this</p>

<pre><code>public void StoreTheUpdatedData(YourBusinessObject theBusinessObject)
{
var yourDataContext = new DataContext()
var oldObject = (from i in yourDataContext.YourbusinessObjects
                where (blah equals blah to select your item and only your item)
                select i).First();

//repeat for all properties in the object
oldObject.Property = theBusinessObject.Property;

yourDataContext.SaveChanges();

<p>Here's the code that I'm using:</p>

}

int main()
{
  int c = auto_cast( 5.0f );  // from an rvalue
}
</code></pre>

<p>To the best of my ability I've tried to follow the C++0x reference collapsing rules and the template argument deduction rules outlined <a href=""http://thbecker.net/articles/rvalue_references/section_08.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, and as far as I can tell the code given above should work.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recall that in pre-0x C++, it is not allowed to take a reference to a reference: something like A&amp; &amp; causes a compile error. C++0x, by contrast, introduces the following reference collapsing rules:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A&amp; &amp; becomes A&amp;  </li>
  <li>A&amp; &amp;&amp; becomes A&amp;  </li>
  <li>A&amp;&amp; &amp; becomes A&amp;  </li>
  <li>A&amp;&amp; &amp;&amp; becomes A&amp;&amp;  </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The second rule is a special template argument deduction rule for function templates that take an argument by rvalue reference to a template argument:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;  
void foo(T&amp;&amp;);
</code></pre>
  
  <p>Here, the following rules apply:  </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>When foo is called on an lvalue of type A, then T resolves to A&amp; and hence, by the reference collapsing rules above, the argument type effectively becomes A&amp;.  </li>
  <li>When foo is called on an rvalue of type A, then T resolves to A, and hence the argument type becomes A&amp;&amp;.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Now when I mouse over the call to <code>auto_cast( 5.0f )</code>, the tooltip correctly displays its return value as <code>auto_cast_wrapper&lt;float&gt;</code>. This meaning that the compiler has correctly followed rule 2:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When foo is called on an rvalue of type A, then T resolves to A.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So since we have an <code>auto_cast_wrapper&lt;float&gt;</code>, the constructor should instantiate to take a <code>float&amp;&amp;</code>. But the error message seems to imply that it instantiates to take a <code>float</code> by value.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ShB3F.png"" alt=""error showing tooltip""></p>

<p>Here's the full error message, showing again that T=float correctly yet the T&amp;&amp; parameter becomes T?</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code> main.cpp(17): error C2440: 'initializing' : cannot convert from 'float' to 'float &amp;&amp;'
     You cannot bind an lvalue to an rvalue reference
     main.cpp(17) : while compiling class template member function 'auto_cast_wrapper&lt;T&gt;::auto_cast_wrapper(T &amp;&amp;)'

<p>One way to do this is to make a content type representing each table (using <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/cck"" rel=""nofollow"">CCK</a>) with the foreign keys represented by type-specific node reference fields. Doing everything as nodes gives you a bunch of prebuilt functionality around nodes, but has a bit of overhead you may want to avoid.</p>

<p>Another option is to leave your database just like it is now. Drupal can do direct database queries, or you can use <a href=""http://drupal.org/project/data"" rel=""nofollow"">Data</a> to expose your tables to Views.</p>

<p>Another option, if those referenced tables really only have 1 non-ID field, is to do the project_companies_assignments as nodes and do the other 3 as taxonomies. But this won't work if those are really more complex entities, and wouldn't be very flexible if they might become more complex.</p>

"4034303","<p>I have a button.
The button is constructed from the StateListDrawable (made of 3 9-patch images).
I need to add an extra drawable that will reside on the button's right side, and i need it to be aligned with the button's right side.
I tried to use the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;

<p>it didn't work and the V image is indeed aligned right but it has a diff from the button's right side. here's a snapshot: <img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/UktI0.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I want the image to be aligned with the button's left, the only way right now i think i can do it is:</p>

<ol>
<li>inherit button, in onLayout AFTER the width has been set get the right edge.</li>
<li>get the background drawable (layerDrawable)</li>
<li>calc the button's width minus the v image width and set it as left margin in the drawable.</li>
</ol>

<p>I should not mention this sounds horrid :-) i hoped there's a better way. Oh the reason it's not part of the image is that i need to know it's width so i can calc the text padding so it wont be hidden by the button's text and because it's not so nice looking as a 9-patch.</p>

here's the code:</p>

    super.onDraw(canvas);
    if( mVImageDrawable != null &amp;&amp; mIsMarked){
        //for some reason the clip binds us to position with margins, which is not so good for us.
        //we need to save the clip, restore the canvas to pre clipping mode, do what we need then
        //put the canvas back to it's previous clipping state.
        Rect bounds = canvas.getClipBounds();
        canvas.restore();
        int right = getRight();
        int left = right - mImageWidth;
        int top = getTop();
        int bottom = top + mVImageDrawable.getIntrinsicHeight();
        mVImageDrawable.setBounds(left, top, right, bottom);
        mVImageDrawable.draw(canvas);
        canvas.save();
        canvas.clipRect(bounds);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If i don't break out the original canvas iget 'pushed down' by any margins i add, it may also be fixed i think using xml property that specifies if children should be clipped on the layout containing this button, but i find that lame solution as it makes my button dependent on our conditions.
The image itself i get from XML using new attributes and style and theme i declare.</p>

"
"4035713","<p>The description below is heavily simplified - it's only one part of a bigger problem that we are tackling but the innards can be safely left out for this question.</p>

<p>Suppose we have the following models: -</p>

    name = models.CharField(max_length=150)
    value = models.DecimalField(max_digits=12,decimal_places=2)

class Person(models.Model):

<p>So basically a person may be assigned zero, one, or more items and each assigned item's value may be overridden for a particular person by specifying the new value in the <code>through</code> model.</p>

<p>What we are aiming to achieve is an html table which has <strong>all</strong> the <code>Item.name</code> as its header row, with one extra column in that header row for <code>Person.name</code>.</p>

<p>Each <code>Person</code> may have a different set of <code>Person.items</code> assigned to them so it is expected that if a <code>Person</code> has not been assigned an <code>Item</code>, the corresponding cell for that <code>Person</code> will be blank (<strong><em>please see attached image</em></strong>).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/t1vDN.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The question is how to place the correct AssignedItem value in the corresponding column. We have a Queryset of Items that we are looping over in the template to create the header row, and then we have a list of lists containing each person's items. But how do we ensure that the correct AssignedItem is displayed under the corresponding Item header?</p>

"4036398","<p>I want to create a reusable component (a custom control) for the iPhone.  It consists of several standard controls prearranged on a View, and then some associated code.  My goals are:</p>

<ol>
<li>I want to be able to use Interface Builder to lay out the subviews in my custom control;</li>
<li>I want to somehow package the whole thing up so that I can then fairly easily drag and drop the resulting custom component into other Views, without having to manually rewire a bunch of outlets and so on.  (A little manual rewiring is fine, I just don't want to do tons and tons of it.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Let me be more concrete, and tell you specifically what my control is supposed to do.  In my app, I sometimes need to hit a web service to validate data that the user has entered.  While waiting for a reply from the web service, I want to display a spinner (an activity indicator).  If the web services replies with a success code, I want to display a ""success"" checkmark.  If the web service replies with an error code, I want to display an error icon and an error message.</p>

<p>The single-use way to do this is pretty easy: I just create a UIView that contains a UIActivityIndicatorView, two UIImages (one for the success icon and one for the error icon), and a UILabel for the error message.  Here's a screenshot, with the relevant parts marked in red:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/oMHsv.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I then wire up the pieces to outlets, and I put some code in my controller.</p>

<p>But how do I package up those pieces -- the code and the little collection of views -- so that I can reuse them?  Here are a few things I found that get me partway there, but aren't that great:</p>

<ul>
<li>I can drag the collection of views and controls into the Custom Objects section of the Library; then, later, I can drag them back out onto other views.  But (a) it forgets which images were associated with the two UIImages, (b) there is a lot of manual rewiring of four or five outlets, and (c) most importantly, this doesn't do bring along the code.  (Perhaps there's an easy way to wire up the code?)</li>
<li>I think I could create an IBPlugin; not sure if that would help, and it seems like a lot of work, and also it's not entirely clear to me whether IBPlugins work for iPhone development.</li>
<li>I thought, ""Hmm, there's code associated with this -- that smells like a controller,"" so I tried creating a custom controller (e.g. <code>WebServiceValidatorController</code>) with associated XIB file.  That actually feels really promising, but then at that point I can't figure out how, in Interface Builder, to drag this component onto other views.  The <code>WebServiceValidatorController</code> is a controller, not a view, so I can drag it into a Document Window, but not into a view.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a feeling I'm missing something obvious...</p>
","iPhone: Create a reusable component (control) that has some Interface Builder pieces and some code","<iphone><xcode><interface-builder>","2010-10-27 18:22:20","13957","4037281","2","<p>I've created similar constructs except that I do not use the result in IB, but instantiate using the code. I'll describe how that works, and at the end I'll give you a hint how that can be used to accomplish what you're after.</p>

<p>I start from an empty XIB file where I add one custom view at the top level. I configure that custom view to be my class. Below in view hierarchy I create and configure subviews as required.</p>

<p>I create all IBOutlets in my custom-view class, and connect them there. In this exercise I ignore the ""File's owner"" completely.</p>

<p>Now, when I need to create the view (usually in controller as part of while/for-loop to create as much of them as needed), I use NSBundle's functionality like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    CGRect fooBarViewFrame = CGRectMake(0, 0, self.view.bounds.size.width, FOOBARVIEW_HEIGHT);
    for (MBSomeData *data in self.dataArray) {
        FooBarView *fooBarView = [self loadFooBarViewForData:data];
        fooBarView.frame = fooBarViewFrame;
        [self.view addSubview:fooBarView];

        fooBarViewFrame = CGRectOffset(fooBarViewFrame, 0, FOOBARVIEW_HEIGHT);
    }
}

- (FooBarView*)loadFooBarViewForData:(MBSomeData*)data
{
    NSArray *topLevelObjects = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@""FooBarView"" owner:self options:nil];
    FooBarView *fooBarView = [topLevelObjects objectAtIndex:0];
    fooBarView.barView.amountInEuro = data.amountInEuro;
    fooBarView.barView.gradientStartColor = data.color1;
    fooBarView.barView.gradientMidColor = data.color2;
    fooBarView.titleLabel.text = data.name;
    fooBarView.titleLabel.textColor = data.nameColor;
    return fooBarView;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice, how I set owner of nib to <code>self</code> - there's no harm as I didn't connect ""File's owner"" to anything. The only valuable result from loading this nib is its first element - my view.</p>

<p>If you want to adapt this approach for creating views in IB, it's pretty easy. Implement loading of subview in a main custom view. Set the subview's frame to main view's bounds, so that they are the same size. The main view will become the container for your real custom view, and also an interface for external code - you open only needed properties of its subviews, the rest is encapsulated. Then you just drop custom view in IB, configure it to be your class, and use it as usual.</p>

"4036990","<p>I have a GridView in my Android application that has a number of ImageViews in it. The space on my screen is limited and I want the images to take up as much of the available space as they can. Unfortunately, the GridView always leaves 5 pixels of empty screen space around the outside edge of the ImageViews (the space between ImageViews is set with horizontal/vertical spacing and behaves correctly). The empty space acts kind of like a margin around the ImageViews, but I can't get rid of it. Does anyone know what's causing this ""border"" and how I can get rid of it (or at least make it smaller)? Thanks.</p>

<p>Update: I'm creating the ImageViews by inflating an .xml file in the getView() method of my Adapter class. Here's the xml I'm inflating:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ImageView
  xmlns:android=""http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android""
  android:background=""#FF00FF"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I defined the GridView in my layout xml file like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;GridView
   android:id=""@+id/mygrid""
   android:layout_width=""fill_parent""
   android:layout_height=""wrap_content""
   android:layout_above=""@+id/abutton""
   android:layout_marginBottom=""8dp""
   android:numColumns=""5"" android:background=""#FF0000""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a screen shot of the problem. The red area in my GridView. The purple areas are my ImageViews. The image being displayed is a simple blue rectangle with a transparent center. The image is 45x45 pixels (but is only 30x30 pixels in my app - I'll worry about that later). The red border around the purple is what I am trying to eliminate.</p>

After checking it out, @Falmarri was on the right track with his answer.  The problem is that Android's CheckBox control already uses the android:paddingLeft property to get the text where it is.</p>

<p>The red line shows the paddingLeft offset value of the entire CheckBox</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/1NpCK.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>If I just override that padding in my XML layout, it messes up the layout.  Here's what setting paddingLeft=""0"" does:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/wXT0G.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Turns out you can't fix this in XML.  You have do it in code.  Here's my snippet with a hardcoded padding increase of 10dp.</p>

<pre><code>final float scale = this.getResources().getDisplayMetrics().density;
checkBox.setPadding(checkBox.getPaddingLeft() + (int)(10.0f * scale + 0.5f),
        checkBox.getPaddingTop(),
        checkBox.getPaddingRight(),
        checkBox.getPaddingBottom());
</code></pre>

<p>This gives you the following, where the green line is the increase in padding.  This is safer than hardcoding a value, since different devices could use different drawables for the checkbox.</p>

<p>UPDATE - As people have recently mentioned in answers below, this behavior has apparently changed in Jelly Bean (4.2).  Your app will need to check which version its running on, and use the appropriate method.</p>

<p>For 4.3+ it is simply setting padding_left. See htafoya's answer for details.</p>

"4039219","<p>Let's say you have a website where the body's background color is red and a content area with a white background that is 1,000 pixels wide. Now let's say you want a drop shadow on the content area that is darkest at the juncture of the content area and the red background, and gets less opaque as it goes off the the left on the left side and the right on the right side. It basically looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/nxjK3.png"" alt=""sideways shadow""></p>

<p>So my strategy is to make the background color of the body red and grab only the shadow in photoshop with a width of ~47px and a height of 1px. My question is:</p>

<p>How do I go about inserting that onto my website such that the browser's horizontal scroll bar only shows up when it's reached 1,000 pixels and not when it's reached 1,000 + 47 + 47 (the width of the content area plus the width of the two shadows).</p>

<p>I'm sure this is a common question, but I really suck at phrasing these things.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: sorry for the lack of code. That's not usually my style. So here we go:</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""mainwrapper""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""left_shadow""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div id=""right_shadow""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    height:100%;
    margin-left:auto;
    margin-right:auto;
    background-color:#e8e8e8;

}
#left_shadow {

    right:-47px;
    width:47px;
    background:url(/images/rightshadow.png) repeat-y;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With this setup, if I shrink the browser window down to 1,095 pixels, it doesn't have a horizontal scroll bar. If I shrink it to 1,094px, it has a horizontal scroll bar because it's recognize those absolutely positioned shadows as part of the content area. My question is: how do I make it so that the scroll bar only shows up when it hits the gray center (at 1,000px)? Thanks again, guys.</p>

y = 9t^3 - 9t^2 - 6t + 4

<p>It seems to work pretty well on relatively small matrices (2x2, 3x3 and 4x4), so I'd expect it to work on 6x6 matrices too. I didn't conduct extensive tests however, and there's a possibility that it's broken.</p>

<p>Although they don't explain the algorithm they actually use there, except to say that it's from p. 137 of ""The Metafont Book"", it appears that the key to it is two important properties of Bezier curves (which are explained elsewhere on that site though I can't find the page right now):</p>

<li>A Bezier curve is always contained within the bounding box defined by its 4 control points</li>
<li>A Bezier curve can always be subdivided at an arbitrary <em>t</em> value into 2 sub-Bezier curves</li>

<p>I draw set of contours (polygons) as  GL_LINE_STRIP.
Now I want to select curve(polygon) under the mouse to delete,move..etc in 3D .</p>

<p>I am wondering which method to use:</p>

<p>1.use OpenGL picking and selection. ( glRenderMode(GL_SELECT) )</p>

<p>2.use manual collision detection , by using a pick-ray and check whether the ray is inside each polygon.</p>
","OpenGL GL_SELECT or manual collision detection?","<opengl><3d><geometry><collision-detection><picking>","2010-10-28 07:14:53","10914","4059685","7","<p>I strongly <strong>recommend against GL_SELECT</strong>. This method is very old and absent in new GL versions, and you're likely to get problems with modern graphics cards. Don't expect it to be supported by hardware - probably you'd encounter a software (driver) fallback for this mode on many GPUs, provided it would work at all. Use at your own risk :)</p>

<p>Let me provide you with an alternative.</p>

<p>For solid, big objects, there's an old, good approach of selection by:</p>

<ul>
<li>enabling and setting the scissor test to a 1x1 window at the cursor position</li>
<li>drawing the screen with no lighting, texturing and multisampling, assigning an unique solid colour for every ""important"" entity - this colour will become the object ID for picking</li>
<li>calling glReadPixels and retrieving the colour, which would then serve to identify the picked object</li>
<li>clearing the buffers, resetting the scissor to the normal size and drawing the scene normally.</li>
</ul>

<p>This gives you a very reliable ""per-object"" picking method. Also, drawing and clearing only 1 pixel with minimal per-pixel operation won't really hurt your performance, unless you are short on vertex processing power (unlikely, I think) or have really a lot of objects and are likely to get CPU-bound on the number of draw calls (but then again, I believe it's possible to optimize this away to a single draw call if you could pass the colour as per-pixel data).</p>

<p>The colour in RGB is 3 unsigned bytes, but it should be possible to additionally use the alpha channel of the framebuffer for the last byte, so you'd get 4 bytes in total - enough to store any 32-bit pointer to the object as the colour.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can create a dedicated framebuffer object with a specific pixel format (like <code>GL_R32UI</code>, or even <code>GL_RG32UI</code> if you need 64 bits) for that.</p>

<p>The above is a nice and quick alternative (both in terms of reliability and in implementation time) for the strict geometric approach.</p>

<ul>
<li>Adds the CheckedItems property</li>
<li>CheckedItems is an <code>ObservableCollection&lt;T&gt;</code> where T is the interal type of ItemsSource</li>
<li>CheckedItems supports two-way Binding to source</li>
<li>If a CheckBoxTreeViewItem hasn't been generated yet (not expanded to) then the source for it won't be in the CheckedItems collection until it has been generated</li>
</ul>

<p>The Control can be used just like a regular TreeView. To add two-way binding for the IsChecked property, the CheckBoxTreeViewItemStyle.xaml ResourceDictionary must be merged. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window.Resources&gt;
    &lt;ResourceDictionary&gt;
        &lt;ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries&gt;

        &lt;/ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries&gt;
    &lt;/ResourceDictionary&gt;
&lt;/Window.Resources&gt;

<pre><code>&lt;cbt:CheckBoxTreeView ...&gt;

"4042542","<p>In my Flash File I have a wheel. The user is able to rotate the wheel by using arrows to jump to the next ""segment"" (think 20 images attached to each other forming the circumference of the wheel).
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/4HKf6.png"" alt=""Wheel""></p>

<p>Clicking the arrows initiates this code:</p>

<pre><code>protected function rotate():void
        {
            var rotateTo:Number = (-360 / numItems) * currentItem + 90;
            TweenLite.to(planesHolder, 1, { rotationY:rotateTo, ease:Quint.easeInOut } );
        }
</code></pre>

<p>However, what I want to be able to do is, click and drag to spin the wheel, complete with acceleration and deceleration and even settling on the nearest image when the wheel reduces to a certain speed. I have no idea how to go about doing this: I'll need to kinda detect a before and after position of the cursor and translate this into a speed for the wheel which then decelerates over time and also detect which image is closest at a certain speed and ""snap"" it, both scrolling up and down. (it'll only affect the Y-axis)</p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated</p>

}
</code></pre>

<p>This should give you the current velocity. (obivously, for the wheel it's ""wheel.rotation += offset / some_value_to_slow_it_down"" in an enterFrame again).</p>

<p>to introduce ""easing"" you can use a friction variable. </p>

<p>again, in the enterFrame event:</p>

<pre><code>offset *= .8;

<p>and then in order to snap to the next image, check how fast your current velocity is; if it's below a certain tolerance set the velocity to 0 and ease it to the nearest value. (you guessed it, in an enterFrame event again</p>

"4043559","<p>I know that this has been discussed several times in many other topics, blogs, book, youtube, etc. But, let me explain my case. I want so that when an application opens up, it shows a facebook connect button to login. After the user login, then it will bring up the tabBarView. In my app delegate I first add the MainViewController and there I had shown the facebook connect login button. Then after it's logged in it adds the tabBarViewController as it's sub view. </p>

<p>Now inside this tabBarViewController I want so that it has 2 tabs. The first tab people and second is map. I want to add a navBar in the people tab. So what I did in my code was the following:</p>

<pre><code>tabBarViewController = [[TabBarViewController alloc] init];
    mvc = [[MapViewController alloc] init];
    UIImage* mapIcon = [UIImage imageNamed:@""13-target.png""];
    mvc.tabBarItem = [[[UITabBarItem alloc] initWithTitle:@""Map"" image:mapIcon tag:0] autorelease];

    tvc = [[TableViewController alloc] init];
    UIImage* peopleIcon = [UIImage imageNamed:@""112-group.png""];
    tvc.tabBarItem = [[[UITabBarItem alloc] initWithTitle:@""People"" image:peopleIcon tag:0] autorelease];

    friendsNavController = [[FriendsNavController alloc] init];


    tabBarViewController.viewControllers = [NSArray arrayWithObjects: friendsNavController, tvc, mvc, nil];
    tvc.userInfo = _userInfo;
    [self.tabBarViewController viewWillAppear:YES];
    [self.view addSubview:self.tabBarViewController.view];
</code></pre>

<p>The result now is that I have 3 tab bar, one with a nav bar, one with a table list, and one is the map. How can I change the code so that the nav bar and the table view are in one tab bar? What am I doing wrong here?</p>

<p>Here's how it looks on interface builder:</p>

<p>The TableViewController (tvc) will be in the navigation controller's viewControllers, not in the tabBarViewController's. Call <code>initWithRootViewController:tvc</code> on the friendsNavController</p>

<p>So your array should only have 2 items (friendsNavController and mvc) for the tabBarViewControllers.</p>

<p>Also, this would mean that the navigationController has a tabBar item instead of the tableViewController.</p>

"4043859","<p>I'm getting the following exception in my log when I try to perform an XA transaction:</p>

<p>I followed these tutorials <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa342335.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Understanding XA Transactions</a> and <a href=""http://www.senthilb.com/2010/01/how-to-make-xa-datasource-work-in-mssql.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">How to make MSSQL Server XA Datasource Work?</a>
After following the first tutorial I also ran the following command in SSMS:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>use master GO<br>
  EXEC sp_addrolemember [SqlJDBCXAUser], 'MyUserName' GO  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'll also add that I ran </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>use master GO EXEC sp_grantdbaccess 'MyUserName','MyUserName' GO  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>to verify that the user has access to the master db and I got an error that ""the user already exists in the current database"".
Lastly I verified, via SSMS, that the role <code>SqlJDBCXAUser</code> does have EXECUTE granted in regard to <code>xp_sqljdbc_xa_init_ex</code>.<br>
The DB I'm using is obviously not <code>master</code> but <code>myDBName</code>.
The only correlation between the two, with regard to this issue, is that <code>MyUserName</code> is the owner of <code>myDBName</code> and exists as a user in <code>master</code>.<br>
My Server is running on Windows XP SP3 (so the hotfix mentioned in the first tutorial is not relevant as it is meant for XP SP2 and under, I know as I tried to run the hotfix).</p>

<p>Has someone encountered this issue? I'd really appreciate some leads.<br>
Thanks,<br>
Ittai  </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
I've looked at the first tutorial, from <code>Microsoft</code>, again and there are two paragraphs which I'm not sure what they mean and they might contain the solution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Execute the database script xa_install.sql on every SQL Server instance that will participate in distributed transactions. This script installs the extended stored procedures that are called by sqljdbc_xa.dll. These extended stored procedures implement distributed transaction and XA support for the Microsoft SQL Server JDBC Driver. You will need to run this script as an administrator of the SQL Server instance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When they say <code>SQL Server instance</code>, do they mean the sql server which contains several databases, including <code>master</code> and <code>myDBName</code>(I'm used to oracle terms which are a bit different)? I ran the <code>xa_install.sql</code> script once as it was given and it states <code>use master</code>.</p>

<p>This is the second paragraph:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Configuring the User-Defined Roles</em><br>
  To grant permissions to a specific user to participate in distributed transactions with the JDBC driver, add the user to the SqlJDBCXAUser role. For example, use the following Transact-SQL code to add a user named 'shelby' (SQL standard login user named 'shelby') to the SqlJDBCXAUser role:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>USE master  
GO  
EXEC sp_grantdbaccess 'shelby', 'shelby'  
GO  
EXEC sp_addrolemember [SqlJDBCXAUser], 'shelby'  
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>SQL user-defined roles are <strong>defined per database</strong>. To create your own role for security purposes, you will have to define the role in each database, and add users in a per database manner. <strong>The SqlJDBCXAUser role is strictly defined in the master database</strong> because it is used to grant access to the SQL JDBC extended stored procedures that reside in master. You will have to first grant individual users access to master, and then grant them access to the SqlJDBCXAUser role while you are logged into the master database.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure but I think that the above bolded sentence says that the <code>SqlJDBCXAUser</code> role should only be defined on <code>master</code> and that other users which access <code>myDBName</code> should be granted access to <code>master</code> and then added to the role and that will <strong>somehow</strong>(don't know how) will enable them when using the <code>myDBName</code> database to use the xa packages.</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong>
This is a screenshot from SSMS of the stored procedure's security settings under the SqlJDBCXAUser role

"4044107","<p>Previously, when I first design a stock application related software, I decide to use <code>java.util.Date</code> to represent date/time information of a stock.</p>

<p>Later, I realize most of the methods in <code>java.util.Date</code> is deprecated. Hence, very soon, I refactor all my code to make use of <code>java.util.Calendar</code></p>

<p>However, there is 2 shortcomings I encounter.</p>

<ol>
<li>Construct <code>java.util.Calendar</code> is comparative slower than <code>java.util.Date</code></li>
<li>Within the accessors getCalendar method of <code>Stock</code> class, I need to clone a copy, as <code>Calendar</code> is a mutable class</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is the current source code for <a href=""http://jstock.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jstock/jstock/src/org/yccheok/jstock/engine/Stock.java?revision=1.18&amp;view=markup"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stock.java</a></p>

<p>Recently, I discover <a href=""http://www.joda.org/joda-time/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Joda-Time</a>. I do the following benchmarking, by creating 1,000,000 <code>java.util.Date</code>, <code>java.util.Calendar</code> and <code>org.joda.time.DateTime</code>. I found <code>org.joda.time.DateTime</code> performs better than <code>java.util.Calendar</code>, during instantiation.</p>

<p>Here is the benchmarking<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/YDq2E.png"" alt=""alt text""> result.</p>

<p>This instantiation speed is important, especially many instance of Stocks will be created, to represent a long price history of a stock.</p>

<p>Do you think is it worth to migrate from Java Calendar to Joda Date Time, to gain application speed performance? Is there any trap I need to pay attention to?</p>
","Migrating from Java Calendar to Joda Date Time","<java><jodatime>","2010-10-28 14:57:49","9610","4044159","5","<p>Note that <code>java.util.Date</code> is mutable too - so if it's a problem now you're using <code>Calendar</code>, it would have been a problem using <code>Date</code> too. That said, using Joda Time is <em>definitely</em> worth doing just because it's a much, much better API.</p>

<p>How certain are you that performance is <em>actually</em> an issue in your particular app? You say there will be ""many instances"" of <code>Stock</code> created... how many? Have you profiled it? I wouldn't expect it to actually make a significant difference in most situations. It's not obvious from your benchmarking graph what you're actually measuring.</p>

<p>Moving to Joda Time is a good idea in general, but I would measure the performance to see how much difference it <em>really</em> makes for you.</p>

"4044146","<p>I <strong><em>think</em></strong> I want to show some kind of confirmation tick type thing by a textbox - (it's traditional windows forms stuff, not WPF) - but not sure if it's a bit naff.  I would like some kind of slick way of showing that a value is incorrect or valid after some tests have been done i.e. a web service is valid with that name or SMTP server seems to running with that name etc.</p>

<p>Should there be even any visual stuff going on or should a simple message on a status strip at the bottom of the window be enough.....</p>

<p>Any ideas are most welcome.
PS - if the tick thing is a good idea what's the best way to implement this with a textbox control.</p>

The custom control could raise a validation event which checks the text and then sets the imagebox graphic based on whether or not the validation passed (or sets it blank if there is not text in the textbox).</p>

<p>The .net centric way would probably be to implement validation providers and some type of custom error provider, like what Henrik is mentioning.</p>

"4044759","<p>For a small timer app I want to write a GTK interface where I can set the desired time. Here is a picture of the interface:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/shq8D.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>However, I am having trouble reading out the fields of the spin buttons. My envisaged procedure for this is the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read out the buttons using methods for each button</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is one  of the methods that does this:</p>

<pre><code># Get the fields of the spinbuttons
def get_seconds(self, widget, spin):
    self.rSeconds = spin.get_value_as_int()
</code></pre>

<p>It is then called like this:</p>

<pre><code>    button = gtk.Button(""Start"")
    button.connect(""clicked"", self.get_seconds, spinnerS)
</code></pre>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Create a timer object with the data from the buttons</li>
</ol>

<p>This is planned to be accomplished using this method:</p>

<pre><code>    # Create the timer object ...
   def prepare_timer(self, widget, hours, minutes, seconds, title, text):
     self.timer = eggTimer(hours, minutes, seconds, title, text)
</code></pre>

<p>Which is called here:</p>

<pre><code>button.connect(""clicked"", self.prepare_timer, self.rHours, self.rMinutes, self.rSeconds, ""some title"", ""some text"")
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, when running the script I get the following error message:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
File ""GTKInterface.py"", line 140, in &lt;module&gt;
SpinButtonExample()
File ""GTKInterface.py"", line 126, in __init__
button.connect(""clicked"", self.prepare_timer, self.rHours, self.rMinutes, self.rSeconds, ""Title"", ""Text"")
AttributeError: SpinButtonExample instance has no attribute 'rSeconds'
</code></pre>

<p>To check whether there really is no instance of that variable, I programmed a short method to print it:</p>

<pre><code>   def returnS(self, widget):
       print self.rSeconds
</code></pre>

<p>And surprisingly this method <em>can</em> ""see"" self.rSeconds. This makes me wonder what determines the visibility of the variable. What am I doing wrong to read this out?</p>
","How can I properly read out spin buttons in pyGTK?","<python><pygtk>","2010-10-28 16:02:48","594","4045533","2","<p>You try to pass the attribute <code>self.rHours</code> to the <code>connect</code> method, but at that point the attribute doesn't exist yet (the <code>clicked</code> handlers haven't executed yet).</p>

<p>Note that even if you fill in <code>self.rHours</code> before calling connect, it will pass the value at the time of connecting, not at the time of the handler executing.</p>

<p>You can solve this by passing <code>self.rHours</code> etc directly to <code>eggTimer</code> in <code>prepare_timer</code>.</p>

<p>But it would be even easier to just combine all the click handlers into one, and use local variables instead of <code>self.rHours</code> etc. There's no reason to split your code over many click handlers like this.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: BTW, you can also use nested functions instead of methods:</p>

<pre><code>...
def prepare_timer(widget):
    self.timer = eggTimer(
        spinnerH.get_value_as_int(),
        spinnerM.get_value_as_int(),
        spinnerS.get_value_as_int(),
        ""Title"", ""Text"")
button.connect(""clicked"", prepare_timer)

So the 'abstract' user makes sense I think, although I don't think it needs to be ‘abstract’, it can be an actor in its own right?</p>

<p>No matter what style you prefer the purpose of modeling is to abstract information away. If the login use case is very significant in a way that it needs to be in the diagram, this diagram is not telling me anything special about it. This diagram tells me that in this system the login use case precedes all other use cases? Duh? Any system will have a login use case so for most systems it won’t be (architecturally/very) significant.  If the use case is special for some reason I would put in the diagram without relationships, that suffices I think. The diagram will communicate: we have a special login use case, we want you to take note of it. Does the system have anonymous use cases? Use cases that can be executed without the login use case? That is significant, worthy of some model elements. Otherwise it is implied IMHO.</p>

<p>If your modeling needs to do more than enable understanding and communication e.g. needs to drive code generation, this is different of course. But then you can – depending on your modeling environment – make it part of the model but not the diagram. That way it can do both: drive code generation and enable understanding, communication.</p>

<pre><code>CommandTarget=""{Binding ElementName=userControl11}""

<p>If you look in the Output window while your program's running, you'll see this:</p>

<pre><code>System.Windows.Data Error: 4 : Cannot find source for binding with reference 'ElementName=userControl11'. BindingExpression:(no path); DataItem=null; target element is 'Button' (Name=''); target property is 'CommandTarget' (type 'IInputElement')
</code></pre>

<p>This is because there's no element named <code>userControl11</code> in the current namescope.  See <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms746659.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> for full details on how XAML namescopes work, but in short, XAML names are only visible within the page, window, or user control that they're declared in.  You can't reference a name declared in your window from inside a user control.</p>

<p>If you want to be able to set a command target on a user control via binding, it needs to be exposed as a dependency property.  You'd add a declaration like this to the control:</p>

<pre><code>public IInputElement CommandTarget
{
    get { return (IInputElement)GetValue(CommandTargetProperty); }
    set { SetValue(CommandTargetProperty, value); }
}

public static readonly DependencyProperty CommandTargetProperty =
        DependencyProperty.Register(""CommandTarget"", typeof(IInputElement), typeof(UserControl1), new UIPropertyMetadata(null));

<p>and in the user control's XAML, bind to this property:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Button Content=""Click"" 
        Command=""local:Commands.ClickCommand"" 
        CommandTarget=""{Binding RelativeSource={RelativeSource AncestorType=UserControl}, Path=CommandTarget}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I can't actually get this to work in your project, but that's because I can't figure your project out.  You seem to have two or three user controls named <code>UserControl1</code> in different namespaces, and the names of the files in the project don't correspond to their contents, and there's not very much in the way of useful commentary.  (Just in general, instead of saying ""this doesn't work,"" describe the behavior you're expecting; that makes it a lot clearer to someone trying to help you what your actual problem might be.)</p>

<p>I hope this is helpful anyway.</p>
"
"4050303","<p>I am creating a Text Editor Type app. I can have multiple editors open via tabs. In my first try, I used simple <code>TextBox</code>es to edit text. Everything worked ok. Then I created a <code>UserControl</code> encapsulating the text box + buttons to perform text manipulation eg. bold/italic etc. I found out that when I open different tabs, they all contain the same content. eg. In Tab1 i enter ""hello world"" that will appear in all tabs. There is ""no separation"" even though they are in different tabs</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window.Resources&gt;
    &lt;DataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type vm:EditorTabViewModel}""&gt;
        &lt;me:MarkdownEditor /&gt;
    &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
&lt;/Window.Resources&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I then as a test, tried a textbox and the usercontrol together to see if I have the same problem. </p>

<pre><code>&lt;Window.Resources&gt;
    &lt;DataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type vm:EditorTabViewModel}""&gt;
        &lt;StackPanel&gt;
            &lt;me:MarkdownEditor Text=""{Binding Content}"" Height=""360"" /&gt;
            &lt;TextBox Text=""{Binding Content}"" Height=""360"" /&gt;
        &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
    &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
&lt;/Window.Resources&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I then discovered a few strange things. With a new document, where content should be nothing, my <code>MarkdownEditor</code> had ""System.Windows.Controls.Grid"" in its text box as it a Grid was bound to the text. Text simple <code>TextBox</code> works as expected. Also I still had the same problem with all <code>UserControl</code>s in the app having the same content.</p>

<p><strong>The XAML for the <code>UserControl</code></strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl x:Class=""MarkdownEditMVVM.Controls.MarkdownEditor.MarkdownEditor"" ...&gt;
    &lt;Grid&gt;
        &lt;ToolBar Grid.Row=""0""&gt;
            &lt;Button Command=""{x:Static local:Commands.PreviewCommand}""&gt;
                &lt;Image Source=""../../Images/16/zoom.png"" /&gt;
            &lt;/Button&gt;
            &lt;!-- more buttons --&gt;
        &lt;/ToolBar&gt;
        &lt;TextBox Grid.Row=""1"" x:Name=""txtEditor"" AcceptsReturn=""True"" Text=""{Binding Path=Text, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}"" /&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/UserControl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><br /></p>

<h1>Update</h1>

<p>I discovered that this has something to do with the way I have usercontrols rendered in the tabs where tabs are bound to <code>ObservableCollection&lt;TabViewModel&gt;</code></p>

<p>Suppose I have a <strong><code>TabViewModel</code></strong> even just a empty class</p>

<pre><code>public class TabViewModel {}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in my <strong>Window</strong></p>

<pre><code>public partial class Window1 : Window
{
    protected ObservableCollection&lt;TabViewModel&gt; _tabs;
    protected ICollectionView _tabsCollectionView;

    public Window1()
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        this.DataContext = this;
        _tabs = new ObservableCollection&lt;TabViewModel&gt;();
        _tabs.Add(new TabViewModel());
        _tabs.Add(new TabViewModel());
        _tabsCollectionView = CollectionViewSource.GetDefaultView(_tabs);
    }

    public ICollectionView Tabs
    {
        get { return _tabsCollectionView; }            
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>XAML</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;TabControl ItemsSource=""{Binding Tabs}"" IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem=""True""&gt;
    &lt;TabControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;TextBlock /&gt;
        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/TabControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
    &lt;TabControl.ContentTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;TextBox /&gt;
        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/TabControl.ContentTemplate&gt;
&lt;/TabControl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I have created a simple Visual Studio Project hosted @<a href=""http://www.mediafire.com/?61aydndajjj6o3n"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mediafire</a> illustrating this problem. I have a feeling it got something to do with the <code>TabViewModel</code>s or the Tab Data Templates</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h1>Update 2</h1>

<p>I further tested the user control problem by adding another tab control, this time without the <code>TabViewModel</code></p>

<pre><code>&lt;TabControl Grid.Column=""1""&gt;
    &lt;TabItem Header=""Tab 1""&gt;
        &lt;TextBox /&gt;
    &lt;/TabItem&gt;
    &lt;TabItem Header=""Tab 2""&gt;
        &lt;TextBox  /&gt;
    &lt;/TabItem&gt;
&lt;/TabControl&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It all worked ok. update also posted to <a href=""http://www.mediafire.com/?mcf7960f84tpn28"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mediafire</a></p>

<p>Made yet another finding. This time, I tested with a binding. things worked fine ...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TabControl Grid.Column=""2"" ItemsSource=""{Binding Tabs}"" IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem=""True""&gt;
    &lt;TabControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;

        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/TabControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
    &lt;TabControl.ContentTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;TextBox Text=""{Binding Text}"" /&gt;

<p>I can get your mediafire example to work correctly by taking the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the dependency property <code>Text</code> from your user control - you don't need it</li>
<li><p>Change your <code>ContentTemplate</code> on the <code>TabControl</code> to the below.  This causes the <code>UserControl.DataContext</code> property to be set to the tab item <code>DataContext</code></p>

<pre><code> &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
      &lt;local:UserControl1 /&gt;
 &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Change your <code>UserControl</code> to the below.  This binds the <code>Text</code> property to the <code>UserControl.DataContext.Text</code> property.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextBox Text=""{Binding Text}"" /&gt;
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Remove the line <code>this.DataContext = this</code> from the constructor of <code>UserControl1</code> - this will obviously replace the <code>DataContext</code> for the user control.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This caused the tabs to be correctly bound with the expected values in the sample app you uploaded</p>

<p><strong>Original Answer</strong></p>

<p>You can have multiple instances of a <code>UserControl</code> - that isn't your problem here.</p>

<p>The reason you are seeing the ""System.Windows.Controls.Grid"" text is because in your <code>UserControl</code> you are binding the <code>Text</code> property to <code>this.DataContext.Text</code> instead of <code>this.Text</code> - the property <em>of</em> your <code>UserControl</code>.</p>

<p>I think what you want to do is change the <code>TextBox</code> binding in your user control to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TextBox Grid.Row=""1"" x:Name=""txtEditor"" AcceptsReturn=""True""
Text=""{Binding Path=Text,
        UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged,
        RelativeSource={RelativeSource Mode=FindAncestor, AncestorType={x:Type me:MarkDownEditor}}}"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note: this relies on the <code>me</code> namespace being set up to point to wherever your <code>MarkDownEditor</code> is located</p>
"
"4050651","<p>Here's my issue,</p>

<p>I'm using a namespace to remove ambiguity from a factory class which is creating domain objects from entity framework entity objects (a POCO factory,.. if that makes sense!). Call me old fashioned but I like things this way :-)</p>

<p>The namespaces I'm working with are aliased as such -</p>

<pre><code>using Entities = DataAccess.Models.AccessControl;
using Cases = DomainModel.BusinessObjects.Implimentations.Cases;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the <code>DomainModel.BusinessObjects.Implimentations.Cases</code> namespace only has one type so far called <code>CaseType</code>. However whilst I was working on another type which consumes the <code>CaseType</code> class I noticed that when I 'dot' into the <code>Cases</code> alias, it points to a totally different namespace in my <code>DataAccess</code> assembly and gives me the <code>CaseTypeFactory</code> in intellisense.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/WLU2O.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>So I checked the <code>CaseType</code> and <code>CaseTypeFactory</code> classes and they are namespaced correctly.  What in god's name is going on?  I really can't work this one out.</p>

<p>Here's the code for the <code>CaseType</code> and <code>CaseTypeFactory</code> if it helps.</p>

<p><strong>CaseTypeFactory</strong></p>

<pre><code>using Domain = DomainModel.BusinessObjects.Implimentations.Cases;
using Entities = DataAccess.Models.AccessControl;
using Interfaces.DataAccess;

    namespace DataAccess.Factories.Cases
    {
        public class CaseTypeFactory :
            IEntityPOCOFactory&lt;Domain.CaseType, Entities.CaseType&gt;
        {
            #region IEntityPOCOFactory&lt;CaseType,CaseType&gt; Members

            public Domain.CaseType CreatePOCO(Entities.CaseType entity)
            {
                return new Domain.CaseType(entity.Id, entity.Name, entity.LastChanged);
            }

            public IList&lt;Domain.CaseType&gt; CreatePOCOs(
                IEnumerable&lt;Entities.CaseType&gt; entities)
            {
                var toReturn = new List&lt;Domain.CaseType&gt;();

                foreach (var entity in entities)
                {
                    toReturn.Add(CreatePOCO(entity));
                }
                return toReturn;
            }

            #endregion
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>CaseType</strong></p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using DomainModel.BusinessObjects.Base;

namespace DomainModel.BusinessObjects.Implimentations.Cases

    public class CaseType : NamedNumberedAndVersioned
    {
        public CaseType(string name, DateTime lastChanged)
            : this(0, name, lastChanged) { }

"4050749","<p>this is a question how to override themable items in Drupal 6.</p>

<p>According to the book ""Pro Drupal Development"", we can override themable items in two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>overriding via Theme functions</li>
<li>overriding via Template files</li>
</ol>

<p>So for example, in order to reformat the breadcrumb, I can:</p>

<ol>
<li>via <strong>function theme_breadcrumb</strong>($breadcrumb)</li>
<li>via <strong>breadcrumb.tpl.php</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>But on my local testing server, the second approach (i.e. via template file) is not working! I see no breadcrumbs at all, while the first approach works fine.</p>

<p>Any idea how could this happen? any special settings I need to configure my Drupal?</p>

","Why is Drupal not aware of my template file?","<drupal><themes>","2010-10-29 09:49:14","5264","4051432","2","<p>Theme functions are setup to either use a template <strong>or</strong> a function to generate the markup, it will never use both as that's pointless.</p>
<p>For a theme function to use a template, it must be defined when you define it in <code>hook_theme</code>.</p>
<p>A template + preprocess function and a theme function really does the same thing: produce markup. It depends on the situation which method is best to use, that's why we have two. The good thing about templates, is that it allows themers to change the markup, without know much about PHP or Drupal.</p>

","ERD diagram and SQL relationships linking user, project and dataset tables","<sql><mysql><relational-database><erd>","2010-10-29 11:08:18","6864","4051428","3","<blockquote>
  <p>Every project has multiple datasets (currDataXXX columns in 'projects')</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that there is a one-to-many relationship from project to dataset. As such, the project ID should be a foreign key on the dataset table, while the currDataXX columns should be removed from the project table. (The current design represents a denormalisation.)</p>

<p>Having done this, you now have two many-to-many relationships between project and user - one with a link entity of roles, and one with a link entity of dataset. Such relationships are normally redundant - in this case, I would assume that a) only users with a role on a project can add datasets, and b) that a single user can add many datasets for a single project.</p>

<p>If both of these assumptions are correct, then there is actually a one to many relationship from role to dataset, and therefore the role ID should be a foreign key on the dataset table, while the user and project IDs become redundant on the dataset table and can be removed. Like this:</p>

<pre><code>+----------+    +----------+    +----------+
|   User   +---&lt;|   Role   |&gt;---+  Project |
+----------+    +----+-----+    +----------+

                |  Dataset |
                +----------+
</code></pre>

<p>[If assumption b) is incorrect, then role and dataset can be combined into a single table, while if assumption a) is incorrect then role and dataset remain two distinct linking entities, unrelated to each other.]</p>

<p>EDIT - updated proposed structure, following Rhizosis' edits:</p>

<pre><code>                +----------+
                |   Role   |

<p>each name has a four digit number followed by - and a number: this number refer to the number of times that sequence is represented. That means 1578 - 22, that node should represent 22sequences.</p>

<p>the file with the sequences aligned: <a href=""http://pastie.org/1266360"" rel=""noreferrer"">file</a><br>
the file with the distance to build a tree: <a href=""http://pastie.org/1266361"" rel=""noreferrer"">file</a></p>

<p>So now I known how to change each size of the node. Each node has a different size, this is easy doing an array of the different values:</p>

<pre><code>    fh = open(MEDIA_ROOT + ""groupsnp.txt"")    
    list_size = {}
    for line in fh:
        if '&gt;' in line:
            labels = line.split('&gt;')
            label = labels[-1]
            label = label.split()
            num = line.split('-')
            size = num[-1]
            size = size.split()
            for lab in label:
                for number in size:
                    list_size[lab] = int(number)

    a = array(list_size.values())
</code></pre>

<p>But the array is arbitrary, I would like to put the correct node size into the right node, I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>         for elem in list_size.keys():
             if labels == elem:
                 Phylo.draw_graphviz(tree_xml, prog=""neato"", node_size=a)
</code></pre>

<p>but nothing appears when I use the if statement.</p>

<p>Anyway of doing this?</p>

<p>I would really appreciate!</p>

The basic premise is that you're going to use the <code>labels/nodelist</code> to build your <code>node_sizes</code>. This way they correlate properly.

"4051853","<p>Is there a way to prevent closed branches from showing up <em>at the top</em> when running the hg view command?  I know about the 'limit' option.  I don't really need closed branches to completely disappear from the view, but it would be nice if they would stay down (they were closed long ago), rather than popping up near the top every time I perform a merge.</p>

<p>Here is an example screenshot where this happens. You can see on the right that the times are all mixed up, which isn't too terrible in this case, but in my real repo the closed-off branches pop up near the top everytime I have a merge, which gets annoying when the closed-off branch is well over a year ago and truly not interesting.</p>

"4053396","<p>I'm coding a flocking algorithm in Java but I'm stuck at a certain point (using the Ardor3D libraries, in a 2D plane).</p>

<p>Basically, I need to find the angle difference to add to the current rotation. If you can only get the way it should be pointing with polar coordinates with 0 degs at north and not the difference, not to worry -- I have a method which returns the angle difference taking into account the wraparound on the angle and negative angles.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/3LX3Z.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>At the moment, I have the following code, which clearly wouldn't work since the algorithm has no reference to the initial rotation:</p>

  Vector2 pos = new Vector2();
  rt.getPosition(pos);

  double rot = pos.angleBetween(app.getAvgBoidPos(new Vector2()).normalizeLocal());
  rt.setRotation(rot);

  pos.addLocal(
   Math.cos((rot - MathUtils.HALF_PI)) * (tpf / 10f),
   Math.sin((rot - MathUtils.HALF_PI)) * (tpf / 10f)
  );
  rt.setPosition(pos);

  super.updateLogic();
</code></pre>

<p>Updated code (not working, from first answer):</p>

<pre><code>    long tpf = currUpdateTimeMS - lastUpdateTimeMS;
    //rt.setRotation(rt.getRotation() + ((tpf / (ROT_SPEED / 2f)) % 360));

    Vector2 avgpos = app.getAvgBoidPos(new Vector2());
    Vector2 pos = rt.getPosition(new Vector2());
    avgpos.subtractLocal(pos);

    double angleRads = rt.getRotation() * FastMath.DEG_TO_RAD;
    double rot = MathUtils.acos((
        (avgpos.getX() * MathUtils.sin(angleRads)
    ) +
        (avgpos.getY() * MathUtils.cos(angleRads)
    )) / ((Math.pow(avgpos.getX(), 2) + Math.pow(avgpos.getY(), 2)) * 0.5));

    double adegdiff = rot * FastMath.RAD_TO_DEG;

    rt.setRotation(rt.getRotation() - adegdiff);
    double newrot = rt.getRotation();

    pos.addLocal(

<p>Another modification based on the other answer:</p>

<pre><code>    long tpf = currUpdateTimeMS - lastUpdateTimeMS;

<p>This won't be cross-browser friendly, though, IE (for certain) is likely to have problems with, <em>at least</em>, the <code>:last-child</code> pseudo-selector, so a JavaScript solution might be better for you in this instance. Although there is a more simple option to wrap the inner <code>div</code>s (in this case the <code>#left</code> and <code>#right</code> <code>div</code>s) in another div:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""wrap""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""left""&gt;

<p>There appears to be some debate regarding just how much of a bug it is and whether it's fixable.  It does seem like bad behavior to me.  It was especially troubling to me because, in Chrome at least, it occurs when the code resides in scripts that are executed immediately (before the page is loaded), even when the console is open, whenever the page is refreshed.  Calling console.log when the console is not yet active only results in a reference to the object being queued, not the output the console will contain.  Therefore, the array (or any object), will not be evaluated until the console is ready.  It really is a case of lazy evaluation.</p>

<p>However, there is a simple way to avoid this in your code:</p>

<pre><code>var s = [""hi""];
console.log(s.toString());
s[0] = ""bye"";
console.log(s.toString());
</code></pre>

<p>By calling toString, you create a representation in memory that will not be altered by following statements, which the console will read when it is ready.  The console output is slightly different from passing the object directly, but it seems acceptable:</p>

<pre><code>hi
bye

<p><strong>Response to Martin Smith's Post</strong></p>

<p>a. Me: <em>The clustered index (and not non-clustered indices) can be used for range queries</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MS: <em>Incorrect: Non-clustered indices can be used perfectly well for range queries as long as the Non Clustered Index is covering.</em></p>
  
  <p>It appears you understand a Covered Query, but you do not understand a Range Query.  Please read up on it.  It is unfortunately named ""query"", but actually it is a performance technique that all the SQL vendors provide. Say you have a real Relational table, which means a composite key, eg. Invoice PK is (CustomerId, InvoiceNo) [not InvoiceId].  Then a query such as:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM Invoice WHERE CustomerId = @CustomerId
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>will navigate the B-Tree of the ClusteredIndex <strong>once</strong>, to find the fist Invoice for the CustomerId.  It will then follow the PageChain of the LeafLevel (data rows) to obtain the second and subsequent Invoice for the CustomerId.  There is no further use of the B-Tree for the query.  The Range Query ends when the first Invoice with CustomerId > 1 is encountered.</p>
  
  <p>That is only <strong>possible</strong> with a ClusteredIndex, where the B-Tree is married to the Data, in a single physical structure.</p>
  
  <p>That is physically impossible with a NonClusteredIndex-plus-Data (which is a Heap or a ClusteredIndex).  Which is why Range Queries <em>cannot</em> be supported for NCIs.  Even if you had an NCI with (CustomerId, InvoiceNo), the data rows will not be in that order; they will be in chronological order in the Heap; so the query that uses that NCI will extract one-row-per-NCI-entry.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>b. Me: <em>CIs are much faster than NCIs; they are far more enhanced because the NCI depends on them</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MS: <em>The B tree structure of a clustered index is no different from a non clustered index. CIs are not enhanced or somehow have a different and superior structure ...</em></p>
  
  <p>No dispute there.  You have simply misunderstood me, re <em>speed</em>, I was talking about the table overall (NonClusteredIndices cannot exist on their own).  Let me clarify: Given the same Key, a ClusteredIndex (which includes data) is always much faster than a NonClusteredIndex-plus-Heap. Navigating, maintaining, creating, deleting from, a single data-storage structure (the CI), is obviously much faster than doing the same to two data-storage structures (NCI+Heap).</p>
  
  <p>It is not physically possible to make two DSs faster than one DS (assuming with the same key.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>c. Not worth a response.  It appears you do not realise that my comments pertain to the incorrect diagrams.  Put another way, your comments (and proof) are <em>also</em> quite correct.</p>

","Objective-C, how do I convert a double to an int?","<iphone><objective-c><xcode>","2010-10-30 10:12:54","54023","4058206","5","<p>A double is a C type, not an Objective-C object. Hence you use C casts:</p>

<pre><code>double myDouble = 3.2;
int myInt = (int)myDouble;
</code></pre>

"4058348","<p>This is probably a dumb post but I've Googled it for about an hour now and can't find anything about it anywhere... I'd like to know how I can have a little movie ""square"" similar to the ones presented in Safari to play Quicktime Movies or YouTube movies.</p>

<p>I'm talking about that :). Is that an Apple private API or can we use the API?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>-Create a UIWebview in the size you desire on screen.</p>

<p>-Disable zooming and scrolling.</p>

<p>-Load custom HTML presenting an embedded video referencing your project bundle (or wherever your video is).</p>

<p>The UIWebview will automatically interpret the embedded video as the ""movie square"" and will provide exactly the same functionality as anyone would expect.</p>

<p>Please let me know if you understood what I described.</p>
