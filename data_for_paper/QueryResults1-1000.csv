"1679","<p>I'm writing an app to help facilitate some research, and part of this involves doing some statistical calculations. Right now, the researchers are using a program called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spss"" rel=""noreferrer"">SPSS</a>. Part of the output that they care about looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/m0swl.png"" alt=""[Part of the SPSS output""></p>

<p>They're really only concerned about the <code>F</code> and <code>Sig.</code> values. My problem is that I have no background in statistics, and I can't figure out what the tests are called, or how to calculate them.</p>

<p>I thought the <code>F</code> value might be the result of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-test#Table_on_F-test"" rel=""noreferrer"">F-test</a>, but after following the steps given on Wikipedia, I got a result that was different from what <code>SPSS</code> gives.</p>
","How do I calculate these statistics?","<statistics><spss>","2008-08-04 22:56:45","10788","1704","6","<p><a href=""http://people.richland.edu/james/lecture/m170/ch13-2wy.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This website</a> might help you out a bit more.  Also <a href=""http://www.unesco.org/webworld/idams/advguide/Chapt4_3.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one</a>.</p>

<p>I'm working from a fairly rusty memory of a statistics course, but here goes nothing:</p>

<p>When you're doing analysis of variance (ANOVA), you actually calculate the F statistic as the ratio from the mean-square variances ""between the groups"" and the mean-square variances ""within the groups"".  The second link above seems pretty good for this calculation.</p>

<p>This makes the F statistic measure exactly how powerful your model is, because the ""between the groups"" variance is explanatory power, and ""within the groups"" variance is random error.  High F implies a highly significant model.</p>

<p>As in many statistical operations, you back-determine Sig. using the F statistic.  Here's where your Wikipedia information comes in slightly handy.  What you want to do is - using the degrees of freedom given to you by SPSS - find the proper P value at which an <a href=""http://www.ento.vt.edu/~sharov/PopEcol/tables/f005.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">F table</a> will give you the F statistic you calculated.  The P value where this happens [F(table) = F(calculated)] is the significance.</p>

<p>Conceptually, a lower significance value shows a very strong ability to reject the null hypothesis (which for these purposes means to determine your model has explanatory power).</p>

<p>Sorry to any math folks if any of this is wrong.  I'll be checking back to make edits!!!</p>

<p>Good luck to you.  Stats is fun, just maybe not this part.  =)</p>

"3725","<p>I'm writing an application that is basically just a preferences dialog, much like the tree-view preferences dialog that Visual Studio itself uses. The function of the application is simply a pass-through for data from a serial device to a file. It performs many, many transformations on the data before writing it to the file, so the GUI for the application is simply all the settings that dictate what those transformations should be.</p>

<p>What's the best way to go about designing/coding a tree-view preferences dialog? The way I've been going about it is building the main window with a docked tree control on the left. Then I have been creating container controls that correspond to each node of the tree. When a node is selected, the app brings that node's corresponding container control to the front, moves it to the right position, and maximizes it in the main window. This seems really, really clunky while designing it. It basically means I have tons of container controls beyond the edge of the main window during design time that I have to keep scrolling the main window over to in order to work with them. I don't know if this totally makes sense the way I'm writing this, but maybe this visual for what I'm talking about will make more sense:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/bVRJB.png"" alt=""form design""></p>

<p>Basically I have to work with this huge form, with container controls all over the place, and then do a bunch of run-time reformatting to make it all work. This seems like a <em>lot</em> of extra work. Am I doing this in a totally stupid way? Is there some ""obvious"" easier way of doing this that I'm missing?</p>

<p>That way, each of these forms can be laid out in its own designer, instantiated one or more times at runtime, and added to the empty area like a normal control.</p>

<p>Perhaps the main form could use a <code>SplitContainer</code> with a static <code>TreeView</code> in one panel, and space to add these forms in the other. Once they are added, they could be flipped through using <code>Hide/Show</code> or <code>BringToFront/SendToBack</code> methods.</p>

"4225","<p>Is there a trivial, or at least moderately straight-forward way to generate territory maps (e.g. Risk)?</p>
<p>I have looked in the past and the best I could find were vague references to Voronoi diagrams.  An example of a Voronoi diagram is this:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/aX9Tp.gif"" alt=""here"" />.</p>

"7477","<p>I'm currently working on an internal sales application for the company I work for, and I've got a form that allows the user to change the delivery address.</p>

<p>Now I think it would look much nicer, if the textarea I'm using for the main address details would just take up the area of the text in it, and automatically resize if the text was changed.</p>

<p>Here's a screenshot of it currently.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/XK48E.png"" alt=""ISO Address""></p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<hr>

<p>@Chris</p>

<p>A good point, but there are reasons I want it to resize. I want the area it takes up to be the area of the information contained in it. As you can see in the screen shot, if I have a fixed textarea, it takes up a fair wack of vertical space.</p>

<p>I can reduce the font, but I need address to be large and readable. Now I can reduce the size of the text area, but then I have problems with people who have an address line that takes 3 or 4 (one takes 5) lines. Needing to have the user use a scrollbar is a major no-no.</p>

<p>I guess I should be a bit more specific. I'm after vertical resizing, and the width doesn't matter as much. The only problem that happens with that, is the ISO number (the large ""1"") gets pushed under the address when the window width is too small (as you can see on the screenshot).</p>

<p>It's not about having a gimick; it's about having a text field the user can edit that won't take up unnecessary space, but will show all the text in it.</p>

<p>Though if someone comes up with another way to approach the problem I'm open to that too.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've modified the code a little because it was acting a little odd. I changed it to activate on keyup, because it wouldn't take into consideration the character that was just typed.</p>

<pre><code>resizeIt = function() {
  var str = $('iso_address').value;
  var cols = $('iso_address').cols;
  var linecount = 0;

  $A(str.split(""\n"")).each(function(l) {
    linecount += 1 + Math.floor(l.length / cols); // Take into account long lines
  })

  $('iso_address').rows = linecount;

"8472","<p>It looks like we'll be adding <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha"" rel=""noreferrer"">CAPTCHA</a> support to Stack Overflow. This is necessary to prevent bots, spammers, and other malicious scripted activity. We only want human beings to post or edit things here!</p>

<pre class=""lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;input type=""hidden"" name=""antispam"" value=""lalalala"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I then have a piece of JavaScript which updates the value every second with the number of seconds the page has been loaded for:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>var antiSpam = function() {
        if (document.getElementById(""antiSpam"")) {
                a = document.getElementById(""antiSpam"");
                if (isNaN(a.value) == true) {
                        a.value = 0;
                } else {
                        a.value = parseInt(a.value) + 1;
                }
        }
        setTimeout(""antiSpam()"", 1000);
}

antiSpam();
</code></pre>

<p>Then when the form is submitted, If the antispam value is still ""lalalala"", then I mark it as spam. If the antispam value is an integer, I check to see if it is above something like 10 (seconds). If it's below 10, I mark it as spam, if it's 10 or more, I let it through.</p>

<pre class=""lang-asp prettyprint-override""><code>If AntiSpam = A Integer
    If AntiSpam &gt;= 10
        Comment = Approved
    Else
        Comment = Spam
Else
    Comment = Spam
</code></pre>

<p>The theory being that:</p>

<ul>
<li>A spam bot will not support JavaScript and will submit what it sees</li>
<li>If the bot does support JavaScript it will submit the form instantly</li>
<li>The commenter has at least read some of the page before posting</li>
</ul>

<p>The downside to this method is that it requires JavaScript, and if you don't have JavaScript enabled, your comment will be marked as spam, however, I do review comments marked as spam, so this is not a problem.</p>

<p><strong>Response to comments</strong></p>

<p>@MrAnalogy: The server side approach sounds quite a good idea and is exactly the same as doing it in JavaScript. Good Call.</p>

<p>@AviD: I'm aware that this method is prone to direct attacks as I've mentioned on <a href=""http://gatekiller.co.uk/Post/JavaScript_Captcha"" rel=""noreferrer"">my blog</a>. However, it will defend against your average spam bot which blindly submits rubbish to any form it can find.</p>

<p>I have my main form validation done using the built in .Net Validation Controls, but now I need to verify that the data sufficiently satisfies the criteria for the Service Layer.</p>

<p>Let's say the following Service Layer messages can show up:</p>

<ul>
<li>E-mail account already exists (failure)</li>
<li>Refering user entered does not exist (failure)</li>
<li>Password length exceeds datastore allowed length (failure)</li>
<li>Member created successfully (success)</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's also say that more rules will be in the service layer that the UI cannot anticipate.</p>

<p>Currently I'm having the service layer throw an exception if things didn't go as planned. Is that a sufficent strategy? Does this code smell to you guys? If I wrote a service layer like this would you be annoyed at having to write Presenters that use it in this way? Return codes seem too old school and a bool is just not informative enough.</p>

<hr>

<p>Cheekysoft, I like the concept of a ServiceLayerException. I already have a global exception module for the exceptions that I don't anticipate. Do you find making all these custom exceptions tedious? I was thinking that catching base Exception class was a bit smelly but wasn't exactly sure how progress from there.</p>

<p>tgmdbm, I like the clever use of the lambda expression there!</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks Cheekysoft for the follow-up. So I'm guessing that would be the strategy if you don't mind the user being displayed a separate page (I'm primarily a web developer) if the Exception is not handled.</p>

<p>However, if I want to return the error message in the same view where the user submitted the data that caused the error, I would then have to catch the Exception in the Presenter?</p>

<p>Here's what the CreateUserView looks like when the Presenter has handled the ServiceLayerException:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/HOJU7.png"" alt=""Create a user""></p>

<p>For this kind of error, it's nice to report it to the same view. </p>

<p>Anyways, I think we're going beyond the scope of my original question now. I'll play around with what you've posted and if I need further details I'll post a new question.</p>
","How Do You Communicate Service Layer Messages/Errors to Higher Layers Using MVP?","<c#><asp.net><exception><mvp><n-tier-architecture>","2008-08-22 03:12:59","6194","22043","3","<p>That sounds just right to me. Exceptions are preferable as they can be thrown up to the top of the service layer from anywhere inside the service layer, no matter how deeply nested inside the service method implementation it is. This keeps the service code clean as you know the calling presenter will always get notification of the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Don't catch Exception</strong></p>

<p>However, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21938/is-it-really-that-bad-to-catch-a-general-exception"">don't catch Exception</a> in the presenter, I know its tempting because it keeps the code shorter, but you need to catch specific exceptions to avoid catching the system-level exceptions. </p>

<p><strong>Plan a Simple Exception Hierarchy</strong></p>

<p>If you are going to use exceptions in this way, you should design an exception hierarchy for your own exception classes. 
At a minumum create a ServiceLayerException class and throw one of these in your service methods when a problem occurs. Then if you need to throw an exception that should/could be handled differently by the presenter, you can throw a specific subclass of ServiceLayerException: say, AccountAlreadyExistsException.</p>

<p>Your presenter then has the option of doing</p>

<pre><code>try {
  // call service etc.
  // handle success to view
} 
catch (AccountAlreadyExistsException) {
  // set the message and some other unique data in the view
}
catch (ServiceLayerException) {
  // set the message in the view
}
// system exceptions, and unrecoverable exceptions are allowed to bubble 
// up the call stack so a general error can be shown to the user, rather 
// than showing the form again.
</code></pre>

<p>Using inheritance in your own exception classes means you are not required to catch multipile exceptions in your presenter -- you can if there's a need to -- and you don't end up accidentally catching exceptions you can't handle. If your presenter is already at the top of the call stack, add a catch( Exception ) block to handle the system errors with a different view.</p>

<p>I always try and think of my service layer as a seperate distributable library, and throw as specific an exception as makes sense. It is then up to the presenter/controller/remote-service implementation to decide if it needs to worry about the specific details or just to treat problems as a generic error.</p>

"31826","<p>I need to know how the performance of different XML tools (parsers, validators, XPath expression evaluators, etc) is affected by the size and complexity of the input document. Are there resources out there that document how CPU time and memory usage are affected by... well, what? Document size in bytes? Number of nodes? And is the relationship linear, polynomial, or worse?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>In an article in IEEE Computer Magazine, vol 41 nr 9, sept 2008, the authors survey four popular XML parsing models (DOM, SAX, StAX and VTD). They run some very basic performance tests which show that a DOM-parser will have its throughput halved when the input file's size is increased from 1-15 KB to 1-15 MB, or about 1000x larger. The throughput of the other models is not significantly affected.</p>

<p>Unfortunately they did not perform more detailed studies, such as of throughput/memory usage as a function of number of nodes/size.</p>

<p>The article is <a href=""https://www.computer.org/10.1109/MC.2008.403"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here.</a></p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I was unable to find any formal treatment of this problem. For what it's worth, I have done some experiments measuring the number of nodes in an XML document as a function of the document's size in bytes. I'm working on a warehouse management system and the XML documents are typical warehouse documents, e.g. advanced shipping notice etc.</p>

<p>The graph below shows the relationship between the size in bytes and the number of nodes (which should be proportional to the document's memory footprint under a DOM model). The different colors correspond to different kinds of documents. The scale is log/log. The black line is the best fit to the blue points. It's interesting to note that for all kinds of documents, the relationship between byte size and node size is linear, but that the coefficient of proportionality can be very different.</p>

One of the great (and fairly simple) visual aids in Eclipse is if you select a particular token, say a declared variable, then the IDE will automatically highlight all other references to that token on your screen.  <a href=""https://notepad-plus-plus.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Notepad++</a>, my preferred Notepad replacement, also does this.</p>

<p>Another neat and similar feature in Eclipse was the vertical ""error bar"" to the right of your code (not sure what to call it).  It display little red boxes for all of the syntax errors in your document, yellow boxes for warnings like ""variable declared but not used"", and if you select a word, boxes appear in the bar for each occurrence of the word in the document.</p>

<p>A screenshot of these features in action:

<p>After a half hour of searching, I've determined that Visual Studio cannot do this on its own, so my question is:  does anyone know of any add-ins for 2005 or 2008 that can provide either one of the aforementioned features?</p>

<p>Being able to highlight the current line your cursor is on would be nice too.  I believe the add-in ReSharper can do this, but I'd prefer to use a free add-in rather than purchase one.</p>

<p>bigbrother82: That didn't work.</p>

<p>SCdF: I tried your suggestion, and now the scrollbars are gone.  I need to work some more on that.</p>
","Prevent SWT ScrolledComposite from eating part of it's children","<java><eclipse><swt><rcp>","2008-08-29 19:36:33","12054","159454","4","<p>This is a common hurdle when using <code>ScrolledComposite</code>.  When it gets so small that the scroll bar must be shown, the client control has to shrink horizontally to make room for the scroll bar.  This has the side effect of making some labels wrap lines, which moved the following controls farther down, which increased the minimum height needed by the content composite.</p>

<p>You need to listen for width changes on the content composite (<code>mParent</code>), compute the minimum height again given the new content width, and call <code>setMinHeight()</code> on the scrolled composite with new height.</p>

<pre><code>public void createPartControl(Composite parent) {
  parent.setLayout(new FillLayout());
  ScrolledComposite scrollBox = new ScrolledComposite(parent, SWT.V_SCROLL);
  scrollBox.setExpandHorizontal(true);
  scrollBox.setExpandVertical(true);

  // Using 0 here ensures the horizontal scroll bar will never appear.  If
  // you want the horizontal bar to appear at some threshold (say 100
  // pixels) then send that value instead.
  scrollBox.setMinWidth(0);

  mParent = new Composite(scrollBox, SWT.NONE);

  FormLayout layout = new FormLayout();
  mParent.setLayout(layout);

  // Adds a bunch of controls here

  mParent.addListener(SWT.Resize, new Listener() {
    int width = -1;
    public void handleEvent(Event e) {
      int newWidth = mParent.getSize().x;

        scrollBox.setMinHeight(mParent.computeSize(newWidth, SWT.DEFAULT).y);
        width = newWidth;
      }
    }
  }

  // Wait until here to set content pane.  This way the resize listener will
  // fire when the scrolled composite first resizes mParent, which in turn
  // computes the minimum height and calls setMinHeight()
  scrollBox.setContent(mParent);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In listening for size changes, note that we ignore any resize events where the width stays the same.  This is because changes in the height of the content do not affect the <i>minimum</i> height of the content, as long as the width is the same.</p>

"37317","<p>I'm working on a windows forms application (C#) where a user is entering data in a form.  At any point while editing the data in the form the user can click one of the buttons on the form to perform certain actions.  By default the focus goes to the clicked button so the user has to click back on to the control they want to edit in order to continue modifying the data on the form.  What I need to be able to do is return the focus to the last edited control after the button click event has been processed.  Here's a sample screenshot that illustrates what I'm talking about:</p>

<p><img src=""https://lh6.ggpht.com/joe.r.barone/SLs4KZMBqfI/AAAAAAAABNw/P6xtqhCo8Y4/s800/SampleApp1.jpg"" alt=""Sample App Screen Shot""></p>

<p>The user can be entering data in textbox1, textbox2, textbox3, etc and click the button.  I need the button to return the focus back to the control that most recently had the focus before the button was clicked.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if anyone has a better way of implementing this functionality than what I've come up with.  Here's what I'm doing right now:</p>

<pre><code>   public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        Control _lastEnteredControl;

        private void textBox_Enter(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            _lastEnteredControl = (Control)sender;
        }

        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            MessageBox.Show(""Do something here"");
            _lastEnteredControl.Focus();
        }


    }
</code></pre>

<p>So basically what we have here is a class variable that points to the last entered control.  Each textbox on the form is setup so the textBox_Enter method is fired when the control receives the focus.  Then, when the button is clicked focus is returned to the control that had the focus before the button was clicked.  Anybody have any more elegant solutions for this?</p>

  <p>If *.mvc extension is not registered
  to the hosting , it will give 404
  exception. The working way of hosting
  MVC apps in that case is to modify
  global.asax routing caluse in the
  following way.</p>
  
  <p>routes.Add(new
  Route(""{controller}.mvc.aspx/{action}"",
  new MvcRouteHandler()) {
      Defaults = new RouteValueDictionary (new{ controller
  = ""YourController""} ) });</p>
  
  <p>In this way all your controller
  request will end up in *.mvc.aspx,
  which is recognized by your hosting.
  And as the MVC dlls are copied into
  your local bin , no special setttings
  need to be done for it.</p>

"59309","<p>What is the best way to vertically center the content of a div when the height of the content is variable.  In my particular case, the height of the container div is fixed, but it would be great if there were a solution that would work in cases where the container has a variable height as well. Also, I would love a solution with no, or very little use of CSS hacks and/or non-semantic markup.</p>

<p>What it does is moving the inner div's top border to the half height of the outer div (<code>top: 50%;</code>) and then the inner div up by half its height (<code>transform: translateY(-50%)</code>). This will work with <code>position: absolute</code> or <code>relative</code>.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that <code>transform</code> and <code>translate</code> have vendor prefixes which are not included for simplicity.</p>

"67665","<p>I recently came across an IE7 only bug that I thought I'd share so when I come to this site 6 months from now to figure out the same thing, I'll have it on hand. </p>

<p>I believe the easiest way to recreate this bug would be the following html in a page with a declared doctype (it works correctly in ""quirks mode"" / no-doctype):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""overflow: auto; height: 150px;""&gt;
    &lt;div style=""position: relative;""&gt;[...]&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In IE7, the outer div is a fixed size and the inner div is relatively positioned and contains more content (assuming the inner div causes an overflow). In all other browsers, this seems to work as expected.</p>

"94007","<h2>Question</h2>

<p>I'm wondering how different ExtendScript is from JavaScript? Could I theoretically hire a web developer who has JavaScript savvy to develop it without demanding an excessive amount of learning on their part?</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>I'm working on a media database (or a so-called ""multimedia library"") project and it is based on XMP (the eXtensible Metadata Platform). The logical tool for administering the metadata and keywording seems to be Adobe Bridge, however I need to contract out the development of a couple of scripts to add a few key functions to Bridge, mainly for interfacing with a server-stored controlled keyword vocabulary.</p>

<p>Upper management, in their infinite wisdom, has decided that putting a software alpha/beta tester and Adobe heavy-lifter [me] in charge of developing the project discovery is the best way to go about this. Whilst I know what I need done, I'm unsure who can actually do it.</p>

<p>Regrettably, my programming knowledge is limited to C++, XML, Apple Script and web languages (unfortunately not including JavaScript), so I'm way out in the weeds when it comes to questions about JavaScript.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.adobe.com/devnet/bridge/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bridge Developer Center</a></p>

<p>Adobe has a handy SDK out there on the subject, but I can't really make much sense of the overall picture. Much of the Adobe user-to-user forum content is old or unrelated.</p>

<h2><strong>Project description</strong></h2>

<p>I need a menu added to the menu bar with three options. The three options would all use ""Clear and Import"" function possible in Bridge's Keywords panel to import 1 of 3 different tab-delimited text files from the database server using either the FTP or HTTP object. </p>

<p>The reading I've done in the Bridge SDK and JavaScript guide suggests that menu items can be added as I've shown in the image below for clarity. Additionally, I've managed to get a very rough version of the ""Clear and Import"" method to work as a startup script, however I'd like to be able to call them on the fly by clicking on the appropriate menu entry.</p>

"94556","<p>We've got a multiproject we're trying to run Cobertura test coverage reports on as part of our mvn site build. I can get Cobertura to run on the child projects, but it erroneously reports 0% coverage, even though the reports still highlight the lines of code that were hit by the unit tests. </p>

<p>We are using mvn 2.0.8. I have tried running <code>mvn clean site</code>, <code>mvn clean site:stage</code> and <code>mvn clean package site</code>. I know the tests are running, they show up in the surefire reports (both the txt/xml and site reports). Am I missing something in the configuration? Does Cobertura not work right with multiprojects?</p>

So the test runs aren't picked up because they run on non-instrumented code. Analyze your build logs more carefully - if I'm right, you'll notice that surefire tests are executed before cobertura:instrument.</p>

<p>My configuration is similar to yours, but in addition to specifying the clean exectution in pluginManagement (like you), I specify the cobertura plugin explicitly in build plugins section:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;build&gt;
  ...
    &lt;plugins&gt;

    &lt;/plugins&gt;
  &lt;/build&gt;

<p>My configuration sorta works, and all Cobertura stuff is in the global organization-wide pom, which all projects use as a parent.</p>

<p>This way projects don't specify anything Cobertura-related in their pom.xml's, but they still generate coverage reports.</p>

"104850","<p>I want to try to convert a string to a Guid, but I don't want to rely on catching exceptions (</p>

<ul>
<li>for performance reasons - exceptions are expensive</li>
<li>for usability reasons - the debugger pops up </li>
<li>for design reasons - the expected is not exceptional</li>

<p>I would try using RegEx, but since the guid can be parenthesis wrapped, brace wrapped, none wrapped, makes it hard. </p>

<p>Additionally, I thought certain Guid values are invalid(?)</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/104850/c-test-if-string-is-a-guid-without-throwing-exceptions#137829"">ChristianK</a> had a good idea to catch only <code>FormatException</code>, rather than all. Changed the question's code sample to include suggestion.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>Why worry about thrown exceptions? Am I really expecting invalid GUIDs all that often? </p>

<p>The answer is <em>yes</em>. That is why I am using TryStrToGuid - I <strong>am</strong> expecting bad data.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong> <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc144096(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Namespace extensions can be specified by appending a GUID to a folder name</a>.

c:\Users.old
c:\UserManager.{CE7F5AA5-6832-43FE-BAE1-80D14CD8F666}
c:\Windows
c:\Windows.old
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong> I might be running a heavily used web-server wants to check the validity of some posted back data. I don't want invalid data tying up resources 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than it needs to be.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong> I might be parsing a search expression entered by a user. </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Ghb12.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I am making a 2d game based on dexter's lab theme. I've got the sprite of dexter from GSA. basically I'm not an artist, so I have to depend on already available sprites, backgrounds, sfx on websites like GameSpriteArchive etc.</p>

<p>But is it okay/legal to use the dexter sprite I have got ?</p>

<p>I wish to release it publicly too, so shall I have to make lot of changes to do that?</p>

<p>Is it possible to get a permission to use the sprite?? My hopes are very less in getting permission.</p>

<p><strong>Besides all that my basic plan is -</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dexter's sprite from google search</p></li>
<li><p>Enemy sprites from various GBA/SNES/etc games</p></li>
<li><p>tiles/objects from these retro games</p></li>
<li><p>Background art and style from blogs and portfolios of artists behind dexter, powerpuff girls, and samurai jack</p></li>

<p>If you made the sprite yourself, you'd be fine.  If you got a release to use it from the creator, you'd be fine.  If it was released into the public domain, you'd be fine.</p>

<p>Anything else, you'd have a definate problem with.</p>

<p>There's also the possible problem you'd have even if you create the sprite yourself -- the likeness of the character is likely copyrighted.  However, that's not as cut-and-dried of an issue.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is one of the things you'd need to ask a real lawyer to get a firm answer on.  If it's for your own use and that of some close friends, you might be able to get away with hoping you don't get noticed (like most people who speed).  If you're planning to include this in something you distribute to the public (even more so if you sell it), you're likely to run into problems.</p>

"129920","<p>I have developed a couple of extensions for Firefox, and am annoyed that it is so hard to get the extension signed.  When an extension isn't signed, it says ""Author not verified"" when it is installed, and to me that just looks wrong.</p>

<p>Since my extensions are free, I don't want to spend $400 on a commercial certificate, but I don't mind spending $50 or so to get it done.  I have both Linux and Windows machines, although my build script currently uses Windows and that would be most convenient to use.</p>

<p>It looks like the IE flash player version is not high enough to properly play the flash file. It looks like it is loading the first frame (which has all of the assets laid out on it to aid with pre-loading). Then, the Actionscript that is supposed to play the movie fails because of the improper flash player version. So, the file stays at frame 1.</p>

<p>Your player detection/inclusion script should catch situations like this and provide alternate content to users without a high enough version of the Flash player.

"155920","<p>I have one of those ""I swear I didn't touch the server"" situations. I honestly didn't touch any of the php scripts. The problem I am having is that php data is not being saved across different pages or page refreshes. I know a new session is being created correctly because I can set a session variable (e.g. $_SESSION['foo'] = ""foo"" and print it back out on the same page just fine. But when I try to use that same variable on another page it is not set! Is there any php functions or information I can use on my hosts server to see what is going on?</p>

<p>Here is an example script that does not work on my hosts' server as of right now:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
session_start();
if(isset($_SESSION['views']))
    $_SESSION['views'] = $_SESSION['views']+ 1;
else
    $_SESSION['views'] = 1;

echo ""views = "". $_SESSION['views'];
echo '&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""page1.php""&gt;Refresh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;';
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The 'views' variable never gets incremented after doing a page refresh. I'm thinking this is a  problem on their side, but I wanted to make sure I'm not a complete idiot first.</p>

<p>Here is the phpinfo() for my hosts' server (PHP Version 4.4.7):

I talked with the host and they explicitly set the session path to a real path that did exist. Hope this helps anyone having session path troubles.</p>

"159262","<p>i have a flow panel that i'm adding extra items to it at runtime based on whether they have chosen to show all the items.  that's all works fine; the expansion is controlled by a toolbar button.</p>

<p>the trouble is we'd like the user to be able to move his mouse over the ""+"" sign to expand the section.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/TRHTG.gif"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>initially i looked at TSpeedButton (OnMouseEnter) but even when it's ""Flat"", the focus rectangle still shows and so the glyph isn't centered.  the main problem with this solution is it's appearance.</p>

<p>then i looked at making a descendant of TImage.  that's a bit ""unconventional"" but it'd work.  in OnMouseEnter or OnClick, it'd toggle an internal boolean ""Expanded"" flag and then load the appropriate picture from a resource.  i have a dislike for unconventional solutions like that.</p>

<p>i need to add it to a few different screens so it's probably prudent for me to have/build a component for this.  i have JVCL but i don't see anything suitable offhand.</p>

"161093","<p>I have a table that looks like that:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/R0TIr.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The rows are sorted by CLNDR_DATE DESC.</p>

<p>I need to find a CLNDR_DATE that corresponds to the highlighted row, in other words:<br>
Find the topmost group of rows WHERE EFFECTIVE_DATE IS NOT NULL,
and return the CLNR_DATE of a last row of that group.</p>

<p>Normally I would open a cursor and cycle from top to bottom until I find a NULL in EFFECTIVE_DATE. Then I would know that the date I am looking for is CLNDR_DATE, obtained at the previous step.</p>

<p>However, I wonder if the same can be achieved with a single SQL?</p>

  AND (CLNDR_DATE &gt; (
    SELECT max(CLNDR_DATE) FROM [TABLE] WHERE EFFECTIVE_DATE IS NULL

<p>Assuming you want the <strong>first</strong> CLNDR_DATE <strong>with</strong> EFFECTIVE_DATE after the <strong>last without</strong>.</p>

"163604","<p>I'm trying to select a random 10% sampling from a small table.  I thought I'd just use the RAND() function and select those rows where the random number is less than 0.10:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM SomeTable
WHERE SomeColumn='SomeCondition' AND
      RAND() &lt; 0.10
</code></pre>

<p>But I soon discovered that RAND() always returns the same number!  Reminds me of this <a href=""http://xkcd.com/221/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">xkcd cartoon</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/random_number.png""></p>

<p>OK, no problem, the RAND function takes a seed value.  I will be running this query periodically, and I want it to give different results if I run it on a different day, so I seed it with a combination of the date and a unique row ID:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM SomeTable
WHERE SomeColumn='SomeCondition' AND
      RAND(CAST(GETDATE) AS INTEGER) + RowID) &lt; 0.10
</code></pre>

<p>I still don't get any results!  When I show the random numbers returned by RAND, I discover that they're all within a narrow range.  It appears that getting a random number from RAND requires you to use a random seed.  If I had a random seed in the first place, I wouldn't need a random number!</p>

<p>I've seen the previous discussions related to this problem: </p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52964/sql-server-random-sort"">SQL Server Random Sort</a><br>
<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19412/how-to-request-a-random-row-in-sql"">How to request a random row in SQL?</a></p>

<p>They don't help me.  TABLESAMPLE works at the page level, which is great for a big table but not for a small one, and it looks like it applies prior to the WHERE clause.  TOP with NEWID doesn't work because I don't know ahead of time how many rows I want.</p>

<p>Anybody have a solution, or at least a hint?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Thanks to AlexCuse for a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/163604/what-am-i-doing-wrong-when-using-rand-in-ms-sql-server-2005#163843"">solution</a> which works for my particular case. Now to the larger question, how to make RAND behave?</p>

<pre><code>select top 10 percent * from MyTable order by NEWID()

Sorry.. missed the UpdatePanel piece.  Make sure that your submit button is also within that UpdatePanel.  A page refresh would not affect your AJAX call, but when the button is outside the panel, it's doing a regular postback so you would be sending the Add Request again.</p>

<p>For most people, this will contain only ""Contacts"".  For corporate networks, it'll probably also contain ""Global Address List"".  The problem is that in my company the GAL is many tens of thousands large, and it's common that conflicts occur in name resolution when attempting to send email and it goes to the wrong person in another country.</p>

<p>Instead, I would like to place a separate Exchange address list ""X"" at the top of that list, to first resolve against names in our own company before checking the GAL.  Then, resolve against ""Contacts"", then GAL.  This configuration would need to be deployed to many hundreds of PCs.</p>

<p>I've been able to do this on my own PC by hacking registry key:

<p>The IDs of the GAL and ""X"" address list are static.  However, the problem is that the ""Contacts"" ID is apparently not static, perhaps unique to the user and/or computer.

"197407","<p>I need to define a calculated member in MDX (this is SAS OLAP, but I'd appreciate answers from people who work with different OLAP implementations anyway).</p>

<p>The new measure's value should be calculated from an existing measure by applying an additional filter condition. I suppose it will be clearer with an example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Existing measure: ""Total traffic""</li>
<li>Existing dimension: ""Direction"" (""In"" or ""Out"")</li>
<li>I need to create a calculated member ""Incoming traffic"", which equals ""Total traffic"" with an additional filter (Direction = ""In"")</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is that I don't know MDX and I'm on a very tight schedule (so sorry for a newbie question). The best I could come up with is:</p>

<pre><code>([Measures].[Total traffic], [Direction].[(All)].[In])
</code></pre>

<p>Which almost works, except for cells with specific direction:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/z3BxZ.png"" alt=""example""></p>

<p>So it looks like the ""intrinsic"" filter on Direction is overridden with my own filter). I need an intersection of the ""intrinsic"" filter and my own. My gut feeling was that it has to do with Intersecting <code>[Direction].[(All)].[In]</code> with the intrinsic coords of the cell being evaluated, but it's hard to know what I need without first reading up on the subject :)</p>

<p><strong>[update]</strong> I ended up with </p>

<pre><code>IIF([Direction].currentMember = [Direction].[(All)].[Out],
    0,
    ([Measures].[Total traffic], [Direction].[(All)].[In])
)
</code></pre>

<p>..but at least in SAS OLAP this causes extra queries to be performed (to calculate the value for [in]) to the underlying data set, so I didn't use it in the end.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Whenever you show the new measure on a report, it will behave as if it has a filter of 'Direction > In' on it, regardless of whether the Direction dimension is used at all.</p>

<p>But in your case, you WANT the Direction dimension to take precendence when used....so things get a little messy. You will have to detect if this dimension is in use, and act accordingly:</p>

<pre><code>WITH MEMBER [Measures].[Incoming Traffic] AS
'IIF([Direction].currentMember = [Direction].[(All)].[Out],
    ([Measures].[Total traffic]),
    ([Measures].[Total traffic], [Directon].[(All)].[In])

<p>To see if the Dimension is in use, we check if the current cell is using OUT. If so we can return Total Traffic as it is. If not, we can tell it to use IN in our tuple.</p>

<p>So far so good - the popups show up and have the correct text in them. Here's the weird thing: I'm trying to use CSS to format what goes in the popups, and it halfway works.</p>
<p>Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h4&gt;</code> elements are rendered using the colors and background images I've specified in my stylesheet.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Everything shows up in Arial, not in the font I've specified in my CSS.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The class names seem to be ignored (e.g. none of the <code>a.Button</code> formatting is applied; if I define a style like the one below, it's ignored.)</p>
<pre><code>  div.MapPopup { background:pink; }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any ideas? I wouldn't have been surprised for the CSS not to work at all, but it's weird that it only partly works.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>Here's a screenshot to better illustrate this. I've reproduced the <code>&lt;div class=&quot;MapPopup&quot;&gt;</code> markup further down on the page (in yellow), to show how it should be rendered according to my CSS.</p>

"210905","<p>I have a table (volunteers_2009) that has all the volunteers stored within, then I have a table (venues) that list all the different venues a volunteer could work (volunteers are assigned to one venue each, and that is stored within volunteers_2009.venue_id, which equals venues.id)</p>

<p>The venues table also has a column for emails, each email is for the chairman of each venue.</p>

<p>What I want to do is be able to automatically send each chairman an email with a CSV file of the volunteers table (volunteers_2009), and during that process, I want it to match up volunteers_2009.venue_id with venues.id and send the CSV with only the volunteers assigned to that chairman's venue, so the chairman only receives a CSV of the volunteers that were assigned to their venue.</p>

<p>I would run thru the venues table, start at the beginning, match the venues.id to volunteers_2009.venue_id, then run the CSV export function to pull all the data WHERE venue_id = #, then attach it into the email and the recipient would be venues.chair_email.</p>

<p>I already have a export CSV function, I could just pass it the venue_id to pull the appropriate volunteers, and I have a working email function as well, so I can pass it the attachment and recipient.</p>

"218337","<p>i'm fairly new to NHibernate and although I'm finding tons of infos on NHibernate mapping on the web, I am too silly to find this piece of information.</p>

<p>this is how I'd like it to look. One clean person that has two Address Properties. </p>

"222716","<p>I am interested in writing a simplistic navigation application as a pet project.  After searching around for free map-data I have settled on the <a href=""http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tgrshp2007/tgrshp2007.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">US Census Bureau TIGER</a> 2007 Line/Shapefile map data.  The data is split up into zip files for individual counties and I've downloaded a single counties map-data for my area.</p>

<p><strong>What would be the best way to read in this map-data into a useable format?</strong> </p>

<p>How should I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read in these files</li>
<li>Parse them - Regular expression or some library that can already parse these Shapefiles?</li>
<li>Load the data into my application - Should I load the points directly into some datastructure in memory?  Use a small database?   I have no need for persistence once you close the application of the map data.  The user can load the Shapefile again.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What would be the best way to render the map once I have read the in the Shapefile data?</strong></p>

<p>Ideally I'd like to be able to read in a counties map data shapefile and render all the poly-lines onto the screen and allow rotating and scaling.</p>

<p>How should I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Convert lat/lon points to screen coordinates?  - As far as I know the Shapefile uses longitude and latitude for its points.  So obviously I'm going to have to convert these somehow to screen coordinates to display the map features.</li>
<li>Render the map data (A series of polylines for roads, boundaries, etc) in a way that I can easily rotate and scale the entire map?</li>
<li>Render my whole map as a series of ""tiles"" so only the features/lines within the viewing area are rendered?</li>
</ul>

<p>Ex. of TIGER data rendered as a display map:<br>
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/mNJ9X.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Anyone with some experience and insight into what the best way for me to read in these files, how I should represent them (database, in memory datastructure) in my program, and how I should render (with rotating/scaling) the map-data on screen would be appreciated.  </p>

<p>EDIT: To clarify, I do not want to use any Google or Yahoo maps API.  Similarly, I don't want to use OpenStreetMap. I'm looking for a more from-scratch approach than utilizing those apis/programs.  This will be a <strong>desktop</strong> application.</p>
","What is the best way to read, represent and render map data?","<java><graphics><rendering><maps>","2008-10-21 17:22:45","8967","488178","11","<p>First, I recommend that you use the <a href=""http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tgrshp2008/tgrshp2008.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2008 TIGER files</a>.</p>
<p>Second, as others point out there are a lot of projects out there now that already read in, interpret, convert, and use the data.  Building your own parser for this data is almost trivial, though, so there's no reason to go through another project's code and try to extract what you need unless you plan on using their project as a whole.</p>
<h2>If you want to start from the lower level</h2>
<p><strong>Parsing</strong></p>
<p>Building your own TIGER parser (reasonably easy - just a DB of line segments), and building a simple render on top of that (lines, polygons, letters/names) is also going to be fairly easy.  You'll want to look at various <a href=""http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/mapproj/mapproj_f.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">map projection types</a> for the render phase.  The most frequently used (and therefore most familiar to users) is the <a href=""http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/mapproj/mapproj_f.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mercator projection</a> - it's fairly simple and fast.  You might want to play with supporting other projections.</p>
<p>This will provide a bit of 'fun' in terms of seeing how to project a map, and how to reverse that projection (say a user clicks on the map, you want to see the lat/lon they clicked - requires reversing the current projection equation).</p>
<p><strong>Rendering</strong></p>
<p>When I developed my renderer I decided to base my window on a fixed size (embedded device), and a fixed magnification.  This meant that I could center the map at a lat/lon, and with the center pixel=center lat/lon at a given magnification, and given the mercator projection I could calculate which pixel represented each lat/lon, and vice-versa.</p>
<p>Some programs instead allow the window to vary, and instead of using magnification and a fixed point, they use two fixed points (often the upper left and lower right corners of a rectangle defining the window).  In this case it becomes trivial to determine the pixel to lat/lon transfer - it's just a few interpolation calculations.  Rotating and scaling make this transfer function a little more complex, but shouldn't be considerably so - it's still a rectangular window with interpolation, but the window corners don't need to be in any particular orientation with respect to north.  This adds a few corner cases (you can turn the map inside out and view it as if from inside the earth, for instance) but these aren't onerous, and can be dealt with as you work on it.</p>
<p>Once you've got the lat/lon to pixel transfer done, rendering lines and polygons is fairly simple except for normal graphics issues (such as edges of lines or polygons overlapping inappropriately, anti-aliasing, etc).  But rendering a basic ugly map such as it done by many open source renderers is fairly straightforward.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to play with distance and great circle calculations - for instance a nice rule of thumb is that every degree of lat or lon at the equator is approximately 111.1KM - but one changes as you get closer to either pole, while the other continues to remain at 111.1kM.</p>
<p><strong>Storage and Structures</strong></p>
<p>How you store and refer to the data, however, depends greatly on what you plan on doing with it.  A lot of difficult problems arise if you want to use the same database structure for demographics vs routing - a given data base structure and indexing will be fast for one, and slow for the other.</p>
<p>Using zipcodes and loading only the nearby zipcodes works for small map rendering projects, but if you need a route across the country you need a different structure.  Some implementations have 'overlay' databases which only contain major roads and snaps routes to the overlay (or through multiple overlays - local, metro, county, state, country).  This results in fast, but sometimes inefficient routing.</p>
<p><strong>Tiling</strong></p>
<p>Tiling your map is actually not easy.  At lower magnifications you can render a whole map and cut it up.  At higher magnifications you can't render the whole thing at once (due to memory/space constraints), so you have to slice it up.</p>
<p>Cutting lines at boundaries of tiles so you can render individual tiles results in less than perfect results - often what is done is lines are rendered beyond the tile boundary (or, at least the data of the line end is kept, though rendering stops once it finds it's fallen off the edge) - this reduces error that occurs with lines looking like they don't quite match as they travel across tiles.</p>
<p>You'll see what I'm talking about as you work on this problem.</p>
<p>It isn't trivial to find the data that goes into a given tile as well - a line may have both ends outside a given tile, but travel across the tile.  You'll need to consult graphics books about this (<a href=""https://www.jagregory.com/abrash-black-book/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Michael Abrash's book is the seminal reference</a>, freely available now at the preceding link).  While it talks mostly about gaming, the windowing, clipping, polygon edges, collision, etc all apply here.</p>
<h2>However, you might want to play at a higher level.</h2>
<p>Once you have the above done (either by adapting an existing project, or doing the above yourself) you may want to play with other scenarios and algorithms.</p>
<p><strong>Reverse geocoding is reasonably easy.</strong>  Input lat/lon (or click on map) and get the nearest address.  This teaches you how to interpret addresses along line segments in TIGER data.</p>
<p><strong>Basic geocoding is a hard problem.</strong>  Writing an address parser is a useful and interesting project, and then converting that into lat/lon using the TIGER data is non-trivial, but a lot of fun.  Start out simple and small by requiring exact name and format matching, and then start to look into 'like' matching and phonetic matching.  There's a lot of research in this area - look at search engine projects for some help here.</p>
<p><strong>Finding the shortest path between two points is a non-trivial problem.</strong>  There are many, many algorithms for doing that, most of which are patented.  I recommend that if you try this go with an easy algorithm of your own design, and then do some research and compare your design to the state of the art.  It's a lot of fun if you're into graph theory.</p>
<p><strong>Following a path and pre-emptively giving instructions</strong> is not as easy as it looks on first blush.  Given a set of instructions with an associated array of lat/lon pairs, 'follow' the route using external input (GPS, or simulated GPS) and develop an algorithm that gives the user instructions as they approach each real intersection.  Notice that there are more lat/lon pairs than instructions due to curving roads, etc, and you'll need to detect direction of travel and so forth.  Lots of corner cases you won't see until you try to implement it.</p>
<p><strong>Point of interest search.</strong>  This one is interesting - you need to find the current location, and all the points of interest (not part of TIGER, make your own or get another source) within a certain distance (as the crow flies, or harder - driving distance) of the origin.  This one is interesting in that you have to convert the POI database into a format that is easy to search in this circumstance.  You can't take the time to go through millions of entries, do the distance calculation (sqrt(x^2 + y^2)), and return the results.  You need to have some method or algorithm to cut the amount of data down first.</p>
<p><strong>Traveling salesman.</strong>  Routing with multiple destinations.  Just a harder version of regular routing.</p>
<p>You can find a number of links to many projects and sources of information on this subject <a href=""http://delicious.com/stienman/gis"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Good luck, and please publish whatever you do, no matter how rudimentary or ugly, so others can benefit!</p>

"225309","<p>Today i stumbled upon an interesting performance problem with a stored procedure running on Sql Server 2005 SP2 in a db running on compatible level  of 80 (SQL2000).</p>

<p>The proc runs about 8 Minutes and the execution plan shows the usage of an index with an actual row count of 1.339.241.423 which is about factor 1000 higher than the ""real"" actual rowcount of the table itself which is 1.144.640 as shown correctly by estimated row count. So the actual row count given by the query plan optimizer is definitly wrong!</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/kESKH.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Interestingly enough, when i copy the procs parameter values inside the proc to local variables and than use the local variables in the actual query, everything works fine - the proc runs 18 seconds and the execution plan shows the right actual row count.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> As suggested by TrickyNixon, this seems to be a sign of the parameter sniffing problem. But actually, i get in both cases exact the same execution plan. Same indices are beeing used in the same order. The only difference i see is the way to high actual row count on the PK_ED_Transitions index when directly using the parametervalues.</p>

<p>I have done dbcc dbreindex and UPDATE STATISTICS already without any success.
dbcc show_statistics shows good data for the index, too.</p>

<p>The proc is created WITH RECOMPILE so every time it runs a new execution plan is getting compiled.</p>

<p>To be more specific - this one runs fast:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE  Proc [dbo].[myProc](
@Param datetime
)
WITH RECOMPILE 
as

set nocount on

declare @local datetime
set @local = @Param

select 
some columns
from 
table1
where
column = @local
group by
some other columns
</code></pre>

<p>And this version runs terribly slow, but produces exactly the same execution plan (besides the too high actual row count on an used index):</p>

<pre><code>CREATE  Proc [dbo].[myProc](
@Param datetime
)
WITH RECOMPILE 
as

set nocount on

select 
some columns
from 
table1
where
column = @Param
group by
some other columns
</code></pre>

<p>Any ideas?
Anybody out there who knows where Sql Server gets the actual row count value from when calculating query plans?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: I tried the query on another server woth copat mode set to 90 (Sql2005). Its the same behavior. I think i will open up an ms support call, because this looks to me like a bug.</p>

<p>The two query plans are different in a small detail which i missed at first. the slow one uses a nested loops operator to join two subqueries together. And that results in the high number at current row count on the index scan operator which is simply the result of multiplicating the number of rows of input a with number of rows of input b.</p>

<p>I still don't know why the optimizer decides to use the nested loops instead of a hash match which runs 1000 timer faster in this case, but i could handle my problem by creating a new index, so that the engine does an index seek statt instead of an index scan under the nested loops.</p>

  <p>The balance factor of a node is the height of its right subtree minus the height of its left subtree and a node with balance factor 1, 0, or -1 is considered balanced. A node with any other balance factor is considered unbalanced and requires rebalancing the tree. The balance factor is either stored directly at each node or computed from the heights of the subtrees.</p>

<p>What you basically need to do:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use the EnumDisplayDevices() API call
  to enumerate the display devices on
  the system and look for those that
  don't have the
  <code>DISPLAY_DEVICE_ATTACHED_TO_DESKTOP</code>
  flag set (this will include any
  mirroring devices so not all will be
  physical displays.) Once you've found
  the display device you'll need to get
  a valid display mode to change it to,
  you can find this by calling the
  EnumDisplaySettingsEx() API call -
  Generally you'd display all the
  available modes and allow the user to
  choose however in your case it sounds
  like this may be possible to hard-code
  and save you an additional step. For
  the sake of future-proofing your
  application though I'd suggest having
  this easily changeable without having
  to dig through the source every time,
  a registry key would be the obvious
  choice. Once you've got that sorted
  out populate a DevMode display
  structure with the information about
  the display positioning (set the
  PelsWidth/Height, Position,
  DisplayFrequency and BitsPerPel
  properties) then set these flags in
  the fields member. Finally call
  ChangeDisplaySettingsEx() with this
  settings structure and be sure to send
  the reset and update registry flags.
  That should be all you need, hope this
  helps,</p>

<p>Using method A, I have fewer surfaces. However, with backface culling turned on, the surfaces will be visible from only one side. If backface culling is turned off, then the flanges (horizontal plates) and web (vertical plate) may be rendered in the wrong order.</p>

<p>Method B seems correct (and I could keep backface culling turned on), but in my model the thickness of plates in the I-section is of no importance and I would like to avoid having to create a separate triangle strip for each side of the plates.</p>

<p>Is there a better solution? Is there a way to switch off backface culling for only certain calls of DrawIndexedPrimitives? I would also like a platform-neutral answer to this, if there is one.</p>

"242894","<p>When writing CUDA applications, you can either work at the driver level or at the runtime level as illustrated on this image (The libraries are CUFFT and CUBLAS for advanced math):</p>

<p>I assume the tradeoff between the two are increased performance for the low-evel API but at the cost of increased complexity of code. What are the concrete differences and are there any significant things which you cannot do with the high-level API?</p>

<p>I am using CUDA.net for interop with C# and it is built as a copy of the driver API. This encourages writing a lot of rather complex code in C# while the C++ equivalent would be more simple using the runtime API. Is there anything to win by doing it this way? The one benefit I can see is that it is easier to integrate intelligent error handling with the rest of the C# code.</p>
","CUDA Driver API vs. CUDA runtime","<c#><c++><cuda><gpgpu><cuda.net>","2008-10-28 11:03:26","42816","254521","4","<p>The CUDA runtime makes it possible to compile and link your CUDA kernels into executables.  This means that you don't have to distribute cubin files with your application, or deal with loading them through the driver API.  As you have noted, it is generally easier to use. </p>

<p>In contrast, the driver API is harder to program but provided more control over how CUDA is used.  The programmer has to directly deal with initialization, module loading, etc.  </p>

<p>Apparently more detailed device information can be queried through the driver API than through the runtime API.  For instance, the free memory available on the device can be queried only through the driver API. </p>

<p>From the CUDA Programmer's Guide:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is composed of two APIs:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>A low-level API called the CUDA driver API,</li>
  <li>A higher-level API called the CUDA runtime API that is implemented on top of
  the CUDA driver API.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>These APIs are mutually exclusive: An application should use either one or the
  other.</p>
  
  <p>The CUDA runtime eases device code management by providing implicit
  initialization, context management, and module management. The C host code
  generated by nvcc is based on the CUDA runtime (see Section 4.2.5), so
  applications that link to this code must use the CUDA runtime API.</p>
  
  <p>In contrast, the CUDA driver API requires more code, is harder to program and
  debug, but offers a better level of control and is language-independent since it only
  deals with cubin objects (see Section 4.2.5). In particular, it is more difficult to
  configure and launch kernels using the CUDA driver API, since the execution
  configuration and kernel parameters must be specified with explicit function calls
  instead of the execution configuration syntax described in Section 4.2.3. Also, device
  emulation (see Section 4.5.2.9) does not work with the CUDA driver API.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no noticeable performance difference between the API's.  How your kernels use memory and how they are laid out on the GPU (in warps and blocks) will have a much more pronounced effect.  </p>

<p>UPDATE:  I'd like to note I did find the issue, and I would like to thank everyone that gave suggestions.  It was the WebKit's ""Inspect Element"" that gave the most useful information.  It appears that their were conflicts with inline styles and styles from the CSS.  While safari grabed the styles from the .css file, the rest of the browsers were using the inline styles.  i was able to see those conflicts with the information in the tool that was suggested. </p>

","Div with Border Images","<css><html>","2008-11-11 23:20:56","20072","282515","2","<p>While none of this is recommendable (mixing markup and design), it's often not the integrator who gets the final word. However, you should still attempt to keep everything as clean as possible. </p>

<p>Your structure is pretty much the only kind of structure you can use to your ends, although if your width  is static (300px?), I'd advise you to have your div background as one larger image repeated vertically. </p>

<p>You'd then have a kind of footer within your div, where you could put the two bottom corners and the bottom picture all in one single image. Instead of having 5 divs inside one, you'd only have one. Note that in bigger environment, this also means the user can download 2 more images in parallel (4 max from a single host), making the overall download of the page faster.</p>

<p>This obviously doesn't work if your width is relative to the parent or can change in any manner though.</p>

<hr>

<p>EDIT: as it happens you specified the width is variable, I don't think there's a cleaner light way to do it HTML-wise.</p>

<p>However, if you still want to maximize the speed of download for the images, consider using sprites: the east and west side images can be put inside the same bigger image: the only thing you modify is the background position:</p>

<pre><code>background-position: 32px 0px; /* this should move the background to the right */
</code></pre>

<p>The advantage is you only need one picture, less connections are needed to download them for the client (faster) and it takes as much place.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

"289176","<p>I keep seeing the phrase ""duck typing"" bandied about, and even ran across a code example or two. I am way too <strike>lazy</strike> busy to do my own research, can someone tell me, briefly:</p>

<ul>
<li>the difference between a 'duck type' and an old-skool 'variant type', and </li>
<li>provide an example of where I might prefer duck typing over variant typing, and</li>
<li>provide an example of something that i would <em>have</em> to use duck typing to accomplish?</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://regmedia.co.uk/2007/05/03/cartoon_duck.jpg"" alt=""duck typing illustration courtesy of The Register""></p>

<p>I don't mean to seem fowl by doubting the power of this 'new' construct, and I'm not ducking the issue by refusing to do the research, but I am quacking up at all the flocking hype i've been seeing about it lately. It looks like <em>no</em> typing (aka dynamic typing) to me, so I'm not seeing the advantages right away.</p>

<p>ADDENDUM: Thanks for the examples so far. It seems to me that using something like 'O->can(Blah)' is equivalent to doing a reflection lookup (which is probably not cheap), and/or is about the same as saying (O is IBlah) which the compiler might be able to check for you, but the latter has the advantage of distinguishing my IBlah interface from your IBlah interface while the other two do not. Granted, having a lot of tiny interfaces floating around for every method would get messy, but then again so can checking for a lot of individual methods...</p>

<p>...so again i'm just not getting it. Is it a fantastic time-saver, or the same old thing in a brand new sack? Where is the example that <em>requires</em> duck typing?</p>

<p>Duck typing can be summed up nicely as ""if it walks like a duck, looks like a duck, acts like a duck, then it's a duck.""  It computer science terms consider duck to be the following interface.</p>

<pre><code>interface IDuck {
  void Quack();

<p>Now let's examine Daffy</p>

<pre><code>class Daffy {
  void Quack() {
    Console.WriteLine(""Thatsssss dispicable!!!!"");
  }
}

<p>Daffy is not actually an IDuck in this case.  Yet it acts just like a Duck.  Why make Daffy implement IDuck when it's quite obvious that Daffy is in fact a duck.  </p>

<p>This is where Duck typing comes in.  It allows a type safe conversion between any type that has all of the behaviors of a IDuck and an IDuck reference.</p>

<pre><code>IDuck d = new Daffy();
d.Quack();
</code></pre>

<p>The Quack method can now be called on ""d"" with complete type safety.  There is no chance of a runtime type error in this assignment or method call. </p>

"291527","<p>I'm working on a website that uses not just frames, but frames within frames (ew, I know, but I don't get to choose).  It actually works OK most of the time, but I'm running into a problem with some of the frames within frames in Safari (only).</p>

<p>Some of the two-deep frames render in Safari with a small space on the right-hand side of the frame - I think it's just the ones with scroll set to ""no"", but fiddling with the scroll settings hasn't fixed it yet.  It basically looks like there should be a scroll bar there, but there isn't.</p>

<p>I've been working on this awhile and tried a lot of things: changing the heights of the rows, changing the scroll settings, adding a <code>colls='100%'</code> tag, changing the heights of the contents of the frames, as well as checking to make sure widths are set to 100% throughout.  Nothing's fixed it so far.  </p>

<p>Does any one know what's happening here?</p>

<p>Here's the basic gist of the code and some screenshots - please forgive the lack of proper quotes; it still renders and fixing them all in this codebase would be a losing battle:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;frameset id=fset frameborder=0 border=0 framespacing=0 onbeforeunload=""onAppClosing()""  onload=""onAppInit()"" rows=""125px,*,0""&gt;
        &lt;frame src=""navFrame.html"" name=ControlPanel marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 frameborder=0 scrolling=no noresize&gt;
        &lt;frame src=""contentFrame.html"" name=C marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 frameborder=0 scrolling=no&gt;
        &lt;frame src=""invisiFrame.html"" name=PING marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 frameborder=0 noresize&gt;
        &lt;noframes&gt;&lt;body&gt;Tough luck.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/noframes&gt;
    &lt;/frameset&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Inside that second frame (named ""C"" and with src of ""contentFrame"") is this:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;HTML&gt;
    &lt;HEAD&gt;&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=""Content-Type"" CONTENT=""text/html; charset=utf-8""&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;frameset rows=""48px,*,28px"" border=0 frameborder=0 framespacing=0&gt;
       &lt;frame src=""pageTitle.html"" name=Title marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 noresize scrolling=no frameborder=0&gt;
       &lt;frame src=""content.html"" name=ScreenBody marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 frameborder=0&gt;
       &lt;frame src=""submitBar.html"" name=ContextPanel marginwidth=0 marginheight=0 frameborder=0 scrolling=no noresize&gt;
    &lt;/FRAMESET&gt;
 &lt;/HTML&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The frames that are troublesome are the first frame (named ""Title"" with src of ""pageTitle.html"") and the last frame (named ""ContextPanel"" with src of ""submitBar.html"") both have their widths set to 100% and heights are either 100%, not set, or a value less than or equal to their row height.</p>

"294773","<p>First of all, I'm kinda new to the barcode formats and what I do know, I've learned from Wikipedia.</p>

<p>We have some barcodes generated by an existing app that uses the Barcode.4NET library. The barcode is in Code 128A format. The code to generate them is pretty simple, looking something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Create the barcode
Code128ABarcode c128A = new Code128ABarcode(""045746201627080857"");
</code></pre>

<p>No other parameters are set for it - after setting the data, we just get a GIF version of the barcode back from the library.</p>

<p>I'm working on a new app that is using iTextSharp for PDF generation and I figured that instead of using two libraries, I would use iTextSharp's barcode generation library since it supports Code128 barcodes. It has a few different variations of Code 128, but none of them are ""Code 128A"".</p>

<p>Here is what the code looks like for it:</p>

<pre><code>Barcode128 code128 = new Barcode128();
code128.CodeType = Barcode.CODE128;
code128.ChecksumText = true;
code128.GenerateChecksum = true;
code128.StartStopText = true;
code128.Code = ""045746201627080857"";

<p>The image on top is generated by iTextSharp and the one on the bottom is generated by Barcode4Net. Obviously, they aren't the same (and not just in the size and the font - the barcoded data is pretty different).</p>

<p>Is anyone out there familiar enough with iTextSharp's (or iText itself) barcode components or with Code 128A barcodes to tell me how to make the iTextSharp one look exactly like the Barcode.4NET one?</p>

"304745","<p>I am currently writing an financial application, and we have a pretty standard customer table. It consists of many mandatory fields, and some optional like Cell/Fax etc.. I'm using NHibernate as a ORM and have all the mappings right. It already works.</p>

<p>I just wonder, how do I ""express"" in code that a field is not-null without commenting? I have the hbm.xml files that document this, but it's kinda awkward to look at them for things like this. </p>

<p>The other thing that comes to mind is that I don't want the repository to throw NHibernate Exceptions at my Logic, so maybe I should go the validation route in the Controller.
Still, how can I make the POCO code express that some fields can be null?</p>

<p><img src=""https://www.tigraine.at/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/demo.png"" alt=""Class Diagram""></p>

<p>As you can see, I want to have Cellular and Fax be optional while Phone mandatory. They are all just composite mappings, so the mapping file just specifies that the single elements of each have to be not-null, but I hate to do the Person.Cellular != null check all the time to avoid having a NullReferenceException.</p>
","Not-Null constraints in POCO Objects","<c#><nhibernate><class-design><dbnull>","2008-11-20 09:18:12","1115","305136","2","<p>There are a few ways of doing this depending on your POCO behaviour and coding style.
Firstly, you could use nullable types to express that this field is nullable and it would therefore be implicit that the rest are not nullable.
Alternatively you could introduce a Phone value type as the type for the Phone property of the POCO you illustrated, implying that because it is not a primitive type it is ""more important"" - this would also enable you to encapsulate phone number validation within the class itself.</p>

<p>In my mind, to be a true POCO object, it need not worry about the underlying nullability within the database table it is persited in... it should actually have validation and value types that express its behaviour as a stand alone entity; thus before it gets to NHibernate it is already in a valid state.</p>

Then, I need to forward resize events using Qt <code>resizeEvent</code> that calls <code>::MoveWindow</code> on the child windows.</p>

<p>Is there a better or more generic mechanism for doing this? Some suggested that I use ActiveX, but I'm not familiar enough with this technology.</p>
","How to combine GUI applications in Windows","<windows><qt><winapi><user-interface><ipc>","2008-11-23 14:32:40","2617","314738","2","<p>Here is how some Windows applications deal with this problem:</p>

<p>If the widget application <em>must</em> be in it's own EXE, then you could use OLE document object embedding (I think that's the right term). This is the same technology that is used to embed a live Excel document into a Word document. Basically, WMF-like data is used across processes to render the UI. This requires tons of work in both the host and widget programs <strong><em>unless</em></strong> the frameworks you're building on top of support this automatically. MFC did a nice job with this... (man, did I just compliment MFC??)</p>

<p>A better solution would be to use some type of in-process solution. Have all the widgets be DLLs. This is how ActiveX works. If widgets needed to run out of process, split the rendering and the out-of-process stuff into 2 parts. An EXE that does the out-of-process stuff and do the rendering locally in the hosting processes. Use some type of IPC to glue them together.</p>

<p>I suspect that the ""restrictions you can't control"" are going to make nearly any ""sane"" implementation impossible...</p>

<p>Preconditions are common relationship constraints.  Some of us write the preconditions and postconditions in the text of the use case.  You can draw it, but it isn't required. </p>

<p>Do not try to sequence the use case bubbles.  That's what activity diagrams and sequence diagrams are for.  That's what narrative text is for.  That's something the users already know.</p>

<p>Also, don't waste a lot of time treating the use cases as a super-high-level programming language.  Remember, the actors already know what they're doing; they don't need help sequencing things.  </p>

<p>You need to focus on capturing the actors, the use cases, and basic ""extends"", ""uses"", ""includes"" among the use cases.  Use Case models are not programming.  The use case diagram is knowledge capture of ""who"" and ""what"".  </p>

<p>Think of it as more like a security model that defines what the actors can do.  Order, sequence, and other details don't matter as much as what the actors do.</p>

<p>When you have Actor associated with actor (like Technician and Front Desk), you're saying that the actors interact outside the system.  You're saying that the tech never logs in to the system to do get their work or log their time.</p>

<p>If the technician actually will log in to get work and record time, then the technician participates in some use cases.  </p>

<p>Use cases aren't programming.  They're things actors do.  Use cases are connected by virtue of being built in a big, common piece of software.  You don't need to draw data flow or logic arrows among the use cases.  They can all be largely independent.</p>

<p>When you design the system, you'll implement UI features and database features that connect the use cases in some sequence.</p>

"320721","<p>I have a list of items (blue nodes below) which are categorized by the users of my application. The categories themselves can be grouped and categorized themselves.</p>

<p>The resulting structure can be represented as a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</a> where the items are sinks at the bottom of the graph's topology and the top categories are sources. Note that while some of the categories might be well defined, a lot is going to be user defined and might be very messy.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/j2MOp.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/j2MOp.png"" alt=""example data""></a><br>

<p>On that structure, I want to perform the following operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>find all items (sinks) below a particular node (all items in Europe)</li>
<li>find all paths (if any) that pass through all of a set of n nodes (all items sent via SMTP from example.com)</li>
<li>find all nodes that lie below all of a set of nodes (intersection: goyish brown foods)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first seems quite straightforward: start at the node, follow all possible paths to the bottom and collect the items there. However, is there a faster approach? Remembering the nodes I already passed through probably helps avoiding unnecessary repetition, but are there more optimizations?</p>

<p>How do I go about the second one? It seems that the first step would be to determine the height of each node in the set, as to determine at which one(s) to start and then find all paths below that which include the rest of the set. But is this the best (or even a good) approach?</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_traversal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">graph traversal algorithms listed at Wikipedia</a> all seem to be concerned with either finding a particular node or the shortest or otherwise most effective route between two nodes.

You're always asking ""Find all X below node(s) Y, where X is of type Z"".  All you need is a generic mechanism for 'locate all nodes below node', (solves Q3) and then you can filter the results for 'nodetype=sink' (solves Q1).  For Q2, you have the starting-point (your node set) and your ending point (any sink below the starting point) so your solution set is all paths from starting node specified to the sink.  So I would suggest that what you basically have a is a tree, and basic tree-traversal algorithms would be the way to go.</p>

<p>The accepted answer to this question in short: YES...</p>

<p>...but what about something like this:</p>

<p>which, in plain English, roughly translates to the two queries:</p>

  <p>Add a new record to the Students table with a Name value of 'Robert'</p>

<p>I could do it, with your helps. However Now I have a small problem too.</p>

<p>When I write query with pivot, products' name become column header. if a product name's length is bigger than 30 character, Oracle don't accept it as a column header. So I have croped and make the product names 30 character to solve this problem. After that a problem occured too.</p>

<p>When I crop product name as 30 character, some products become same name and ""ORA-00918: column ambiguously defined"" error message occured.</p>

<p>I worry that we may run the risk of not having sufficient precision and accuracy in our database or in .NET numeric types. I am also worried that we may see artifacts of floating-point maths (although that is probably a question all to itself). </p>

<p>For example, the source data may have been a pressure quantity expressed (and read in from some 3rd party service) in Psi (pounds per square inch). The engineers will have chosen this unit of measure because (for the quantity being expressed) this will tend to give easily-digested, human-readable numbers without requiring scientific notation.</p>

<p>When we 'standardise' the number, i.e. when we convert this quantity for our own persistence, we might convert it to Pa (Pascals) which will require either multiplying or dividing the number by some other potentially large number.</p>

<p>We often end up storing very large or very small numbers, and worse - we might do further calculations on these numbers.</p>

<p>At present we use ORACLE float and System.Double.</p>

","Modeling Relational Entities for Auditing Question States","<database-design><relational>","2008-12-05 16:58:21","321","344598","6","<p>I think the gist of what you're asking is: Should the state of the question be based on an intermediary table between Questions and State that has a time component (A) or should the table be more static, but with a log-oriented history table on the side (B). </p>

<p>(Note: If you wanted to do a pure version of (A), then Boofus is right, you probably wouldn't put the state_id in the Questions table as well, as it's redundant; but that would definitely be inconvenient because it would make simple queries to get questions in a particular state much harder. So you've got a hybrid version here.)</p>

<p>In general, if the requirement of keeping historical information about the state is really just for audit purposes - that is, if it won't be regularly queried by the application itself - you're probably better off going with option B, because it's a little simpler (there's really just the one ""Questions"" table, with a reference table for the states, and a ""log"" table for previous states). I think that shows your intent a little better. </p>

<p>However, if the application semantics are more complex (e.g., if you have queries like ""show all questions that have been in state X within the last 24 hours ...""), then an approach like (A) might make more sense. It's essentially making the state of a question into a time-dependent fact. If you do that, just be aware that it complicates things - either all your queries are harder and have to consider time, or you have to worry about keeping the state_id on Questions in sync with the most recent state in the Questions table.

"345758","<p>What is the issue with the Silverlight Tools for VS2008? I can't seem to place controls on the designer surface. This didn't work for me on two different machines.
Do you have to tweak the XAML to be able to place the first control?<br>
Cursor stays a compass-like-cross when over the surface. Are you supposed to drag-n-drop controls or draw them?</p>

","Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio 2008 - Placing a Control Issue","<visual-studio-2008><silverlight><silverlight-2.0>","2008-12-06 02:06:23","1671","540045","3","<p>This is in response to your request for my thoughts on this question from your comments on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/539754/silverlight-getting-the-domain-information"">this post</a>.</p>

<p>As both Aaron Fischer and Boyan have mentioned, the Visual Studio 2008 Silverlight 2 Designer installed by the 'Microsoft Silverlight Tools for Visual Studio 2008 SP1' package is <strong>currently</strong> read-only.</p>

<p>In Visual Studio 2008 you cannot currently drag and drop Silverlight 2 controls from the Toolbox onto the designer.  You can however drag controls from the Toolbox to the Xaml editor if your place your cursor in the Xaml editor before initiating the drag.</p>

<p>This will more than likely change in a future version of the tools package, possibly this year.  There will be a few announcements on Silverlight 3 at MIX 09, I don't know if this will be one of them.</p>

<p>To get design control over your Silverlight 2 Xaml you need to install Expression Blend 2.  You can download a trial <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=5ff08106-b9f4-43cd-abad-4cc9d9c208d7&amp;displaylang=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, make sure you also <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/details.aspx?familyid=EB9B5C48-BA2B-4C39-A1C3-135C60BBBE66&amp;displaylang=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">install Service Pack 1 from here</a>.  If you have this installed then right click on Page.xaml in Visual Studio 2008 and select 'Open in Expression Blend...'</p>

<p>Once open in Expression Blend you can drag and drop controls from the toolbox onto the designer.  In Expression Blend 2 the Toolbox is called the 'Asset Library' and it can be accessed by left clicking the double right arrow &gt;&gt; at the bottom of the list on the left of the screen:</p>

<p><img src=""https://silverlight2blogpost.s3.amazonaws.com/step6.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Once the Asset Library is open, a good tip if you can't find the control you are looking for (you mention you cannot find the Button control in Expression Blend 2) is to type it's name in the Search area at the top left or click the 'Show All...' check-box as shown above.</p>

<p>This blog post is a good place to start for a <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/02/28/first-look-at-using-expression-blend-with-silverlight-2.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">First Look at Using Expression Blend with Silverlight 2</a> with plenty of screenshots.

"348291","<p>Working in C# win forms, I'm trying to create a list of items where each item is compromised of an icon and 3 labels in a specific layout.</p>

<p>Here's an illustration of it</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Z1Kj4.jpg"" alt=""http://hosting04.imagecross.com/image-hosting-13/3535help.jpg""></p>

<p>The user should be able to select a single row, just like in a normal Listview.</p>

<p>My first attempt was creating the icon and labels in a user control, and then putting the user control in a FlowLayoutPanel in a vertical layout (which would create a list).
The problem was the selection. Since the clicking event was captured by the user control, there was no easy way on letting the other user controls in the list know that the control was selected and if they are currently selected they now should be unselected. (I hope this makes sense...)</p>

<p>I also tried using some open source custom Listview I found here: <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/list/aa_listview.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/list/aa_listview.aspx</a>
but it's too buggy.</p>

<p>I also thought about creating a custom control that will inherit from Listview and render my user control in the list, but I also read about someone who tried to do that and got into a lot of difficulties.</p>

<p>I'd be very happy to hear any suggestions you might have.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

One control which you seem to already have, which is the icon and the labels. This will be an internal control that you can't instantiate outside of your assembly. The second user control, will just be a container of sorts (you can do this either by actually using a user control, or inheriting from a panel or whatever, doesn't matter). This will just serve as a collection of the individual items, and it will manage the selecting and unselecting of the items. </p>

<p>Basically, each user control will raise the click event, which your container user control will hook up to. It will then know which to select, and which to unselect. </p>

<p>Hope that makes sense!</p>

"349409","<p>Tk GUI's seem to be universally considered ugly, but  I'd like to know why specifically.  Some in the Tcl/Tk world would argue that this is a moot point as there is much better support now for native look and feel, which is a big reason I decided on Tcl/Tk.  Now, however, the problem is, because I'm leveraging a Tcl/Starkit vfs (virtual file system), the native file dialogs don't work, and I'm going to have to revert to pure Tk file dialogs.</p>

<p>Please I'm looking for specific, technical reasons, e.g. regarding font aliasing (or lack thereof) or font style, or color, etcetera.  Because I personally don't buy the ""it's just ugly to me"".  To me, its just different, and I switch between Mac and Windows and Linux with regularity, so I'm used to different looks/feels.</p>

<p>Specifically, motif-ish look of a traditional Tk GUI is regarded as ugly:<br></p>

<p><img src=""https://web.archive.org/web/20140120195559/http://ascend4.org/images/e/e4/Browser01.png"" alt=""Tcl/Tk GUI Sample""></p>
","Why are Tk GUI's considered ugly?","<user-interface><tk-toolkit>","2008-12-08 12:45:18","36573","349792","8","<p>I think part of the reason is that Tk is surprisingly powerful and easy to use but it doesn't do much hand-holding. Since it is so easy, people with little experience in UI design can get something to work in very short order. But, without a lot of experience they rely on defaults and shortest-path-to-a-solution (read: don't take time to hide scrollbars when they aren't needed, don't use common idioms for toolbars, don't properly align widgets, etc). </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Tk's defaults aren't always the prettiest. As the screenshot in the question shows, the default uses relatively thick border widths and suboptimal fonts, and the checkboxes are indeed straight out of the 80's. In the hands of an expert, though, all these problems are minor issues that can be take care of in idle moments. </p>

<p>For example, with five minutes of tweaking, the original screenshot can look like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/md7eD.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/md7eD.png"" alt=""slightly improved ui""></a></p>

<p>Certainly that's still a bit clunky looking, but arguably it's better than the original by a considerable bit. With an hour dedicated to the task, several more improvements could be made.</p>

<p>With tk 8.5 (and actually for a couple years prior) there is support for themes and for native widgets, and even the X11 version gets a minor facelift. Tk is still behind the curve in eye candy though, forcing one to ""roll their own"" if the design calls for gradients, animations and so forth.</p>

<p>Tcl and Tk, however, remain a good pragmatic solution for most types of applications. If you're trying to compete with a flash application you'll lose. But if you have an industrial application that just needs to work and be usable and perhaps multi-platform, Tk is still one of the best choices out there.</p>

<p>When I import it it has a folder called <strong>Web App Libraries</strong>.  So here are a few of my newbie questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I am unsure about what the exact purpose is of this folder is?  What does it do, why would you choose to have it in your project?  </p></li>
<li><p>I see that it has a folder called <strong>Improted Classes</strong> and foobar.class files inside it - why?<br>
<em>(These seemed to be mirrored in <strong>Web Content</strong> folder - although here you can modify the code as they are foobar.java.)</em></p></li>
<li><p>There are references to foobar.jar files too - these are also mirrored in <strong>WEB-INF/lib</strong> folder too - why?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I know these are basic type questions but I'm just getting to grips with Java and website dev, so apologies if they sound a bit dumb! - BTW if anyone knows any good online resource to understand more about project file structures like this, then let me know.

<li>During a WAR file import, Eclipse basically does two things: 

<ul>
<li>Creates a new web project and copies WAR's content to 'WebContent'  subfolder of the new project.</li>
<li>Based on the WAR,  it constructs project's metadata  (.project and .classpath files).</li>

<li>What does the ""readonly"" keyword in C# mean?</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it usually helps to ask your applicants to complete a simple coding exercise such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write your own linked list class without using the built-in classes.</li>
<li>Write your own hashtable class without using the built-in classes.</li>
<li>Write a class that represents a binary tree. Write a method that traverses all nodes of the tree.</li>
<li>Write a method to perform a binary search on an array without using built-in methods.</li>
<li>Draw a database schema for a blog. Each user only has one blog, each blog has many categories, each category has many posts, and each post can belong to more than one category. Ask your applicant to write queries to pull specific information out.</li>
</ul>

<p>Next, look for specific technical know-how:</p>

<ul>
<li>(Event handlers) Create a class with a custom event handler, create another class which hooks onto the custom event handler.</li>
<li>(XML) Load an XML document and select all of the nodes with properties x, y, and z.</li>
<li>(Functional programming) Create a function that accepts another function as a parameter. A Map or Fold function works really good for this.</li>
<li>(Reflection) Write a function which determines if a class has a particular attribute.</li>
<li>(Regex) Write a regular expression which removes all tags from a block of HTML.</li>
</ul>

<p>None of these are particularly difficult questions for a proficient C# programmer to answer, and they should give you a good idea of your applicants particular strengths. You may also want to work in a few questions/code sample that make use of specific design patterns.</p>

<p><strong>[Edit for clarification]</strong>: </p>

<p>Seems that a lot of people don't understand why I'd ask these types of questions. Let me touch on a few peoples comments (I'm not quoting directly, but paraphrasing instead):</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> When was the last time anyone used volatiles or weak references?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> When I give technical interviews, I look to see whether a person understands the high-level <em>and</em> low-level features of .NET. Volatiles and weak references are two low-level features provided by .NET -- even if these features aren't used often in practice, answers to these questions are extremely revealing:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A good understanding of volatiles demonstrates that a person understands how compiler optimizations change the correctness of code, how threads keep local copies of shared state which may be out of sync at any given time, and is minimally aware of some of the complexities of multithreaded code.</p></li>
<li><p>A good understanding of weak references demonstrates that a person knows about the intimate details of the garbage collector and how it decides when to free memory. Sure, you could ask candidates ""how does a garbage collector work"", but asking about weak references gets a much better, more thoughtful reply.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>.NET is a fairly abstract language, but star developers almost always have a deep understanding of the CLR and the low-level details of .NET's runtime.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why would anyone need to implement their own hashtable or linked list?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> I'm not implying that the Dictionary class is inferior or that people should roll their own hashtable. This is a basic question which tests whether a person has a <em>minimal</em> understanding of datastructures. Thats what these questions test for: bare minimum understanding.</p>

<p>You learn about these hashtables and linked lists on the first day of Data Structures 101. If someone can't write a hashtable or a linked list from scratch, then they have a <em>huge</em> gap in their technical knowledge.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Q:</strong> Why are these questions so crud-oriented?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Because the title of this thread is ""questions every good .NET developer should know"". Every .NET developer begins their career writing crud apps, and 90% of all application development people do for a living is concerned with line-of-business applications.</p>

<p>I think questions testing a persons knowledge of line-of-business apps are appropriate in most cases, unless you're looking for developers in very specific niches, such as compiler development, game-engine development, theorem-proving, image processing, etc.</p>

<p>I've added the CSS for the divs that the drop downs are contained in. Also changing the line height doesn't make a difference. The only difference between the two drop downs (Item and Quantity) is the width. Changing the width on Item doesn't make a difference.</p>

"376642","<p>I'm not really sure how to title this question but basically I have an interface like this:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IFoo
{
    string ToCMD();
}
</code></pre>

<p>a couple of absract classes which implement IFoo like:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Foo : IFoo
{
   public abstract string ToCMD();
}

public abstract class Bar : IFoo
{
    public abstract string ToCMD();
}
</code></pre>

<p>then classes which inherit Foo and Bar:</p>

<pre><code>public class FooClass1 : Foo
{
    public override string ToCMD()
    {return ""Test"";}
} ///there are about 10 foo classes.

public class BarClass : Bar
{
    public override string ToCMD()
    {return ""BarClass"";}
} ///about the same for bar classes.
</code></pre>

<p>I am doing this so that when I have my custom list like:</p>

<pre><code>public class Store&lt;T&gt; : List&lt;T&gt;  where T : IFoo {}
</code></pre>

<p>I then can restrict the types that go in it but by having the interface it will still take any type of IFoo.</p>

<p>Something like:</p>

<pre><code>Store&lt;Foo&gt; store = new Store&lt;Foo&gt;(); //Only Foo types will work.
store.Add(new FooClass1()); //Will compile.

Store&lt;IFoo&gt; store = new Store&lt;IFoo&gt;(); //All IFoo types will work.
store.Add(new FooClass1()); //Will compile.
store.Add(new BarClass()); //Will compile.

","Inheritance design using Interface + abstract class. Good practice?","<c#><oop><inheritance>","2008-12-18 01:34:52","13828","376673","5","<p>The need for an inheritance chain is questionable, in general. </p>

<p>However the specific scenario of combining an abstract base class with an interface.. I see it this way:</p>

<p>If you have an abstract base class like this, you should also have a corresponding interface. If you have an interface, then use the abstract base class only where the inheritance chain is sensible.</p>

<p>That said, if I'm writing a library and this is part of my API/Framework, I will generally include a ""default implementation"" that can be used as a base class. It will implement the interface methods in a naive, general way, where possible, and leave the rest for inheritors to implement/override as needed.</p>

<p>This is just a convenience feature of the library though, to assist people who want to implement the interface by providing a functional example that may cover most of what they need to implement already.</p>

<p>In short, the interface is more valuable than the base class, but a base class might save a lot of time and reduce buggy interface implementations. </p>

"378265","<p>i'm using the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb775248(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Win32 progress dialog</a>. The damnest thing is that when i call:</p>

<pre><code>progressDialog.StopProgressDialog();
</code></pre>

<p>it doesn't disappear. It stays on screen until the user moves her mouse over it - <em>then</em> it suddenly disappers. </p>

<p>The call to <code>StopProgressDialog</code> returns right away (i.e. it's not a synchronous call). i can prove this by doing things after the call has returned:</p>

<pre><code>private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
   //Force red background to prove we've started
   this.BackColor = Color.Red;
   this.Refresh();

   //Start a progress dialog
   IProgressDialog pd = (IProgressDialog)new ProgressDialog();
   pd.StartProgressDialog(this.Handle, null, PROGDLG.Normal, IntPtr.Zero);

   //The long running operation
   System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10000);

   //Stop the progress dialog
   pd.SetLine(1, ""Stopping Progress Dialog"", false, IntPtr.Zero);
   pd.StopProgressDialog();
   pd = null;

   //Return form to normal color to prove we've stopped.
   this.BackColor = SystemColors.Control;
   this.Refresh();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The form:</p>

<ul>
<li>starts gray</li>
<li>turns red to show we've stared</li>
<li>turns back to gray color to show we've called <strong>stop</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>So the call to <code>StopProgressDialog</code> has returned, except the progress dialog is still sitting there, mocking me, showing the message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stopping Progress Dialog</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/5YXHR.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/5YXHR.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Doesn't Appear for 10 seconds</h2>

<p>Additionally, the progress dialog does not appear on screen until the</p>

<pre><code>System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(10000); 
</code></pre>

<p>ten second sleep is over.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Not limited to .NET WinForms</h2>

<p>The same code also fails in Delphi, which is also an object wrapper around Window's windows:</p>

<pre><code>procedure TForm1.Button1Click(Sender: TObject);
var
   pd: IProgressDialog;
begin
   Self.Color := clRed;
   Self.Repaint;

   pd := CoProgressDialog.Create;
   pd.StartProgressDialog(Self.Handle, nil, PROGDLG_NORMAL, nil);

   Sleep(10000);

   pd.SetLine(1, StringToOleStr('Stopping Progress Dialog'), False, nil);
   pd.StopProgressDialog;
   pd := nil;

   Self.Color := clBtnFace;
   Self.Repaint;
end;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>PreserveSig</h2>

<p>An exception would be thrown if <code>StopProgressDialog</code> was failing.</p>

<p><em>Most</em> of the methods in IProgressDialog, when translated into C# (or into Delphi), use the compiler's automatic mechanism of converting failed COM HRESULTS into a native language exception. </p>

<p>In other words the following two signatures will throw an exception if the COM call returned an error HRESULT (i.e. a value less than zero):</p>

<pre><code>//C#
void StopProgressDialog();

//Delphi
procedure StopProgressDialog; safecall;
</code></pre>

<p>Whereas the following lets you see the HRESULT's and react yourself:</p>

<pre><code>//C#
[PreserveSig]
int StopProgressDialog();

//Delphi
function StopProgressDialog: HRESULT; stdcall;
</code></pre>

<p>HRESULT is a 32-bit value. If the high-bit is set (or the value is negative) it is an error.</p>

<p>i am using the former syntax. So if <code>StopProgressDialog</code> is returning an error it will be automatically converted to a language exception. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Just for SaG i used the <code>[PreserveSig]</code> syntax, the returned HRESULT is zero;</p>

<hr>

<h2>MsgWait?</h2>

<p>The symptom is similar to what <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/02/17/375307.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Raymond Chen described once</a>, which has to do with the incorrect use of PeekMessage followed by MsgWaitForMultipleObjects:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Sometimes my program gets stuck and
  reports one fewer record than it
  should. I have to jiggle the mouse to
  get the value to update. After a while
  longer, it falls two behind, then
  three...""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that would mean that the failure is in IProgressDialog, since it fails equally well on CLR .NET WinForms and native Win32 code.</p>

"383921","<p>I have the types <code>Rock</code>, <code>Paper</code>, and <code>Scissors</code>.  These are components, or ""hands"" of the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.  Given two players' hands the game must decide who wins.  How do I solve the problem of storing this chain chart</p>

<p>without coupling the various hands to each other?  The goal is to allow adding a new hand to the game (Jon Skeet, for instance) without changing any of the others.</p>

<p>I am open to any idea of proxies, but not to large switch statements or duplication of code.  For instance, introducing a new type that manages the chain's comparisons is fine as long as I don't need to change it for every new hand I add.  Then again, if you can rationalize having a proxy that must change for every new hand or when a hand changes, that is welcome as well.</p>

<p>This is sort of a Design 101 problem, but I am curious what solutions people can come up with for this.  Obviously, this problem can easily scale to much larger systems with many more components with any arbitrarily complex relationships among them.  That's why I'm laying a very simple and concrete example to solve.  Any paradigm used, OOP or otherwise, is welcome.</p>

<p>To add a new hand value, just add the value to RPSEnum in the proper sequence.  If it is the new ""lowest"" hand, update FirstRPS.  If it is the new ""highest"" hand, update LastRPS.  You shouldn't need to change the actual algorithm at all.</p>

"388677","<p>I have a multi-browser page that shows vertical text.</p>

<p>As an ugly hack to get text to render vertically in all browsers I've created a custom page handler that returns a PNG with the text drawn vertically.</p>

<p>Here's my basic code (C#3, but small changes to any other version down to 1):</p>

<pre><code>Font f = GetSystemConfiguredFont();
//this sets the text to be rotated 90deg clockwise (i.e. down)
StringFormat stringFormat = new StringFormat { FormatFlags = StringFormatFlags.DirectionVertical };

SizeF size;
// creates 1Kx1K image buffer and uses it to find out how bit the image needs to be to fit the text
using ( Image imageg = (Image) new Bitmap( 1000, 1000 ) )
    size = Graphics.FromImage( imageg ).
        MeasureString( text, f, 25, stringFormat );

using ( Bitmap image = new Bitmap( (int) size.Width, (int) size.Height ) )
{
    Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage( (Image) image );
    g.FillRectangle( Brushes.White, 0f, 0f, image.Width, image.Height );
    g.TranslateTransform( image.Width, image.Height );
    g.RotateTransform( 180.0F ); //note that we need the rotation as the default is down

    // draw text
    g.DrawString( text, f, Brushes.Black, 0f, 0f, stringFormat );

    //make be background transparent - this will be an index (rather than an alpha) transparency
    image.MakeTransparent( Color.White );

    //note that this image has to be a PNG, as GDI+'s gif handling renders any transparency as black.
    context.Response.AddHeader( ""ContentType"", ""image/png"" );
    using ( MemoryStream memStream = new MemoryStream() )
    {
        image.Save( memStream, ImageFormat.Png );
        memStream.WriteTo( context.Response.OutputStream );
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This creates an image that looks how I want it to, except that the transparency is index based. As I'm returning a PNG it could support a proper alpha transparency.</p>

<p>Is there any way to do this in .net?</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks to Vlix (see comments) I've made some changes, though it still isn't right:</p>

<pre><code>using ( Bitmap image = new Bitmap( (int) size.Width, (int) size.Height, PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb ) )
{
    Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage( (Image) image );
    g.TranslateTransform( image.Width, image.Height );
    g.RotateTransform( 180.0F ); //note that we need the rotation as the default is down

    // draw text
    g.DrawString( text, f, Brushes.Black, 0f, 0f, stringFormat );

    //note that this image has to be a PNG, as GDI+'s gif handling renders any transparency as black.
    context.Response.AddHeader( ""ContentType"", ""image/png"" );
    using ( MemoryStream memStream = new MemoryStream() )
    {
        //note that context.Response.OutputStream doesn't support the Save, but does support WriteTo
        image.Save( memStream, ImageFormat.Png );
        memStream.WriteTo( context.Response.OutputStream );
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now the alpha appears to work, but the text appears blocky - as if it still has the jaggie edges but against a black background.</p>

<p>Is this some bug with .Net/GDI+? I've already found that it fails for even index transparencies for gifs, so I don't have much confidence it it.</p>

<p>This image shows the two ways this goes wrong:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ONFOT.png"" alt=""vertical text comparison""></p>

<p>The top image shows it with no white background or <code>MakeTransparent</code> call. The second with  the background filled with white and then <code>MakeTransparent</code> called to add the index transparency.</p>

<p>Neither of these is correct - the second image has white aliasing jaggies that I don't want, the first appears to be solidly aliased against black.</p>

"413876","<h3>Boring introduction:</h3>

<p>In my workplace, we have a very old WinForms product (in market since 1994, and still running on VB3). It has three very different versions, each of them goes to one client. The clients pass it on to their users, some of which are shared. The versions can live side-by-side.</p>

<p>Five years ago, we rewrote one of those versions in C#.Net. Two years later, another version (let's call it version M) was rewritten, and two years after that, it was time for the last remaining version (let's call it version C) to be converted. We've been working for one year, and are going to production this week.</p>

<p>During the conversions, it has been decided not to convert anything that was sold as an external module; these were built in VB6, and they used several controls from <a href=""http://www.becubed.com/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BeCubed</a> and <a href=""http://www.fpoint.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FarPoint</a>. There are two such modules in version M, and three modules in version C.
Each module has it's own MSI installer, which is run quietly by the main product's installer.</p>

<h3>The bug</h3>

<p>During production, we found a bug: when version C in installed on a fresh computer, then version M is installed, we get a message as soon as an external module is opened in version C:</p>

<p><img src=""https://lh3.ggpht.com/_L2AGN2rr3tM/SWJBoWNPcVI/AAAAAAAACaA/pPNTMywh4Gw/BeCubed.PNG"" alt=""BeCubed error""></p>

<p>After clicking Ok, the module works. Also, this doesn't happen when they are installed in any other order and both modules in version M work perfectly.</p>

<h3>Other details</h3>

<ul>
<li>All OCX and DLL files have been compared through all the module setups; the files are identical.  </li>
<li>All modules work when only one version M or C is installed, or when M is installed first.  </li>
<li>We have licenses for all the software we use, including BeCubed.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Does anyone know what could cause such an error, what could be a possible solution?</p>

That probably causes a conflict in doubly registering the OCX's or something like that. I have no idea what was wrong there, but when we changed the one module to install in the <code>Shared Files</code> folder like everyone else, the problem was fixed. I'm writing this here so if anyone has a similar problem, he could check to make sure all the files are installed at the same location.</p>

"424927","<p>I've been developing a very large LOB app using my flavor of M-V-VM which I call M-V-MC (Model-View-ModelController), which is a kind of a combination between M-V-C and M-V-VM. I had posted <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/322612/what-are-the-most-common-mistakes-made-in-wpf-development#322679"">this answer</a> regarding how views get instantiated in M-V-VM to the question ""<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/322612/what-are-the-most-common-mistakes-made-in-wpf-development"">what-are-the-most-common-mistakes-made-in-wpf-development</a>"".</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/7021/sam"">Sam</a> made the following comment regarding my answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This creates a follow-up-question: how
  do you create the views? I use
  RelayCommands to bind actions from the
  view to the ViewModel, so the view
  does not even know an action has
  fired, does not know he should open a
  new view. Solution: create an event in
  the VM for the View to subscribe to?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I originally started M-V-VM development I had this notion that EVERYTHING should live in the ViewModel, and have studied a lot of examples from guys like <a href=""http://joshsmithonwpf.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Josh Smith</a> and <a href=""http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Karl Shifflett</a>. However I have yet to come up with a good example of when a command needs to live in the ViewModel.</p>

<p>For instance, let's say I have a ListView that displays Customers, and a button that I click to allow me to edit the currently selected customer. The ListView (View) is bound to  a CustomerVM (ViewModel). Clicking the button fires the EditCustomerCommand which opens a popup window which allows me to edit all the properties of the CustomerVM. Where does this EditCustomerCommand live? If it involves opening a window, (UI functionality), shouldn't it be defined in the code-behind of the view?
<img src=""https://codingcontext.files.wordpress.com/2009/01/commandflow.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Does anyone have any examples of when I should define a command in the View versus the ViewModel?</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/47006/matthew-wright"">Matthew Wright</a> states below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>New and delete from a list would be
  good examples. In those cases, a blank
  record is added or the current record
  is deleted by the ViewModel. Any
  action taken by the view should be in
  response to those events occurring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if I click the new button, what happens? A new instance of the CustomerVM is created by the Parent ViewModel and added to it's collection right? So how then would my editing screen get opened? The view should create a new instance of the Customer ViewModel, and pass it in to the ParentVM.Add(newlyCreatedVM) method right? </p>

<p>Let's say I delete a customer record via the DeleteCommand living on the VM. the VM calls into the business layer and tries to delete the record. It can't so it returns a message to the VM. I want to display this message in dialogbox. How does the view get the message out of the command action? </p>
","M-V-VM - Any Examples of using commands in the ViewModel?","<wpf><mvvm>","2009-01-08 16:30:11","2275","450178","4","<p>Never thought I'd see myself being quoted in a question.</p>

<p>I pondered this question myself for some time, and made a rather pragmatic decision for my code base:</p>

<p>In my code base, the ViewModel is getting called when actions happen, and I wanted it to stay this way. Additionally I do not want the ViewModel to control the views.</p>

<p><strong>What did I do?</strong><br>
I added a controller for navigation:</p>

<pre><code>public interface INavigation
{
  void NewContent(ViewModel viewmodel);
  void NewWindow(ViewModel viewmodel);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This controller does contain two actions: NewContent() does show new content in the current window, NewWindow() creates a new Window, populates it with the content and shows it.<br>
Of course my viewmodels have no clue which view to show. But they do know which viewmodel they want to show, so according to your example when DeleteCommand is executed, it would call the navigation service function <em>NewWindow(new ValidateCustomerDeletedViewModel())</em> to show a window stating 'the customer has been deleted' (overkill for this simple messagebox, but it would be easy to have a special navigator function for simple messageboxes).</p>

<p><strong>How does the viewmodel get the navigation service?</strong></p>

<p>My viewmodel class has a property for the navigation controller:</p>

<pre><code>public class ViewModel
{
  public INavigation Navigator { get; set; }
  [...]
}
</code></pre>

<p>When a viewmodel is attached to a window (or whatever displays the view), the window will set the Navigator property, so the viewmodel can call it.</p>

<p><strong>How does the navigator create the view to the viewmodel?</strong></p>

<p>You could have a simple list which view to create for which viewmodel, in my case I can use simple reflection since the names are matching:</p>

<pre><code>public static FrameworkElement CreateView(ViewModel viewmodel)
{
  Type vmt = viewmodel.GetType();
  // big bad dirty hack to get the name of the view, but it works *cough*
  Type vt = Type.GetType(vmt.AssemblyQualifiedName.Replace(""ViewModel, "", ""View, "")); 
  return (FrameworkElement)Activator.CreateInstance(vt, viewmodel);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course the view needs a constructor accepting the viewmodel as parameter:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class ValidateCustomerDeletedView : UserControl
{
  public ValidateCustomerDeletedView(ValidateCustomerDeletedViewModel dac)
  {
    InitializeComponent();
    this.DataContext = dac;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How does my window look like?</strong></p>

<p>Simple: my main window does implement the INavigation interface, and shows a start page on creation. See for yourself:</p>

<pre><code>public partial class MainWindow : Window, INavigation
{
  public MainWindow()
  {
    InitializeComponent();
    NewContent(new StartPageViewModel());
  }

  public MainWindow(ViewModel newcontrol)
  {
    InitializeComponent();
    NewContent(newcontrol);
  }

  #region INavigation Member
  public void NewContent(ViewModel newviewmodel)
  {
    newviewmodel.Navigator = this;
    FrameworkElement ui = App.CreateView(newviewmodel);
    this.Content = ui;
    this.DataContext = ui.DataContext;
  }

  public void NewWindow(ViewModel viewModel)
  {
    MainWindow newwindow = new MainWindow(viewModel);
    newwindow.Show();
  }
  #endregion
}
</code></pre>

<p>(This does work equally well with a NavigationWindow and wrapping the view into a Page)</p>

<p>Of course this is testable, since the navigation controller can be mocked easily.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure if this is a perfect solution, but it works nicely for me right now. Any ideas and comments are welcome!</p>

","WPF v/s System.Drawing","<wpf><system.drawing>","2009-01-09 12:08:47","4376","427881","3","<p>While WPF probably does have drawing capabilities, it is really a completely different UI toolkit than WinForms. If you are planning on porting your app to WPF eventually, I could see drawing your image using it, but otherwise I don't really see why you'd want to introduce WPF just to draw one image. That seems like overkill to me.</p>

"432404","<p>I'm designing this forum layout where I come up with a nice design to draw the forum tables, however, I'm not sure that this can be easily done in HTML/CSS.</p>

<p>Before I continue to draw the whole layout, I need to know if this is achievable and how, otherwise, I'll have to ditch this effect and rethink things...</p>

<p>For instance, the design I currently have is this one:</p>

</p>

<p>The rows on this example have all the same height but this is just an example. The real table will actually have different row heights and the code needs to take that into account...</p>

<p>How can this be done?</p>
","How to create a table inner bevel in HTML/CSS?","<html><css><html-table>","2009-01-11 05:06:10","10257","432414","3","<p>CSS can do something like that very easily, provided you don't have to scale the gradient vertically as the table size increases. Below is an example you could use that would give you the effect you depicted above.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I somehow didn't see the bevels (I guess I have to blame it being too late at night and my vision being too blurry). I had to zoom in to really see them, but I've updated my solution to fit. You need to add an extra ""div"" tag to make this solution work, but it is possible, although I don't think it works too the extent that your image shows. It will work fairly decently though. Down below I include some jQuery script that will remove the need for an extra <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<p>For markup, you'd use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;table cellspacing=""0""&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=""side""&gt;&lt;div class=""bevel""&gt;lorem&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=""side""&gt;&lt;div class=""bevel""&gt;ipsum&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=""main""&gt;&lt;div class=""bevel""&gt;dolor sit amet, consectetur&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=""side""&gt;&lt;div class=""bevel""&gt;lorem&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=""side""&gt;&lt;div class=""bevel""&gt;ipsum&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=""main""&gt;&lt;div class=""bevel""&gt;dolor sit amet, consectetur&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=""side""&gt;&lt;div class=""bevel""&gt;lorem&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=""side""&gt;&lt;div class=""bevel""&gt;ipsum&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=""main""&gt;&lt;div class=""bevel""&gt;dolor sit amet, consectetur&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And in your stylesheet you'd use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>td {
    border: 1px solid #777;
}

.bevel {
    background: url('img.png') top left repeat-x;
    margin: -1px;
    border-top: 1px solid #fbfbfb;
    border-left: 1px solid #fbfbfb;
    border-right: 1px solid #bfbfbf;
    border-bottom: 1px solid #e8e8e8;
}

.side {
    width: 30px;
}

.main {
    width: 170px;
}

table {
    border-collapse: collapse;
    border-spacing: 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>For the image, make it 1px wide. It will repeat itself to fit the width of the cell. If you want the gradient to stretch vertically, you're out of luck. CSS can not scale images, only repeat them. In order to make a vertically scaled background image, you'd need to either have nightmarish markup, or some sort of JavaScript to make it work. </p>

<p>To get rid of the <code>&lt;div /&gt;</code> tag soup, you can use jQuery to insert the  tags so you don't clutter up your source. All you need to do is add an '<code>outerBevel</code>' class to the <code>&lt;td /&gt;</code> tags instead, then call this jQuery script (if you're using jQuery. I'm sure other JavaScript APIs can do similar things):  </p>

<pre><code>$('.outerBevel').wrapInner('&lt;div class=""bevel""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;');

"438196","<p>I have three applications that talk to each other using sockets. They can all live on their own machines but they can also share a machine. Right now I'm having two of them on the same and the third on its own machine. I'm trying to make my communication bullet proof so I unplug cables and kill the applications to make sure everything works as intended.</p>

<p>Now, when I unplug the network cable to PC2 (the red connection ""Con B""), the internal connection stops talking (the blue connection ""Con A""). I send stuff from ""App 1"" on the socket that never gets to ""App 2"".</p>

<p>I have made a mechanism that discovers this and disconnects and then reconnects and after that I can unplug the cable all I want and ""Con A"" just keeps working. It's only that first time.</p>

<p>I have confirmed having communication through ""Con A"" before disconnecting ""Con B"".<br>
I connect and reconnect exactly the same way, it's the same code, so there's no difference.</p>

<p>What's happening?</p>

PC 1 and PC 2 share addresses down to the last byte.<br>

<p>Can you give any advice for someone interested in writing an emulator (particularly a game system)?</p>
","How do emulators work and how are they written?","<emulation><c64>","2009-01-15 22:10:15","340135","448689","16","<p>Emulation is a multi-faceted area.  Here are the basic ideas and functional components.  I'm going to break it into pieces and then fill in the details via edits.  Many of the things I'm going to describe will require knowledge of the inner workings of processors -- assembly knowledge is necessary.  If I'm a bit too vague on certain things, please ask questions so I can continue to improve this answer.</p>
<h2>Basic idea:</h2>
<p>Emulation works by handling the behavior of the processor and the individual components.  You build each individual piece of the system and then connect the pieces much like wires do in hardware.</p>
<h2>Processor emulation:</h2>
<p>There are three ways of handling processor emulation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interpretation</li>
<li>Dynamic recompilation</li>
<li>Static recompilation</li>
</ul>
<p>With all of these paths, you have the same overall goal: execute a piece of code to modify processor state and interact with 'hardware'.  Processor state is a conglomeration of the processor registers, interrupt handlers, etc for a given processor target.  For the 6502, you'd have a number of 8-bit integers representing registers: <code>A</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>Y</code>, <code>P</code>, and <code>S</code>; you'd also have a 16-bit <code>PC</code> register.</p>
<p>With interpretation, you start at the <code>IP</code> (instruction pointer -- also called <code>PC</code>, program counter) and read the instruction from memory.  Your code parses this instruction and uses this information to alter processor state as specified by your processor.  The core problem with interpretation is that it's <em>very</em> slow; each time you handle a given instruction, you have to decode it and perform the requisite operation.</p>
<p>With dynamic recompilation, you iterate over the code much like interpretation, but instead of just executing opcodes, you build up a list of operations.  Once you reach a branch instruction, you compile this list of operations to machine code for your host platform, then you cache this compiled code and execute it.  Then when you hit a given instruction group again, you only have to execute the code from the cache.  (BTW, most people don't actually make a list of instructions but compile them to machine code on the fly -- this makes it more difficult to optimize, but that's out of the scope of this answer, unless enough people are interested)</p>
<p>With static recompilation, you do the same as in dynamic recompilation, but you follow branches.  You end up building a chunk of code that represents all of the code in the program, which can then be executed with no further interference.  This would be a great mechanism if it weren't for the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code that isn't in the program to begin with (e.g. compressed, encrypted, generated/modified at runtime, etc) won't be recompiled, so it won't run</li>
<li>It's been proven that finding all the code in a given binary is equivalent to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem"" rel=""noreferrer"">Halting problem</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These combine to make static recompilation completely infeasible in 99% of cases.  For more information, Michael Steil has done some great research into static recompilation -- the best I've seen.</p>
<p>The other side to processor emulation is the way in which you interact with hardware.  This really has two sides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Processor timing</li>
<li>Interrupt handling</li>
</ul>
<h2>Processor timing:</h2>
<p>Certain platforms -- especially older consoles like the NES, SNES, etc -- require your emulator to have strict timing to be completely compatible.  With the NES, you have the PPU (pixel processing unit) which requires that the CPU put pixels into its memory at precise moments.  If you use interpretation, you can easily count cycles and emulate proper timing; with dynamic/static recompilation, things are a /lot/ more complex.</p>
<h2>Interrupt handling:</h2>
<p>Interrupts are the primary mechanism that the CPU communicates with hardware.  Generally, your hardware components will tell the CPU what interrupts it cares about.  This is pretty straightforward -- when your code throws a given interrupt, you look at the interrupt handler table and call the proper callback.</p>
<h2>Hardware emulation:</h2>
<p>There are two sides to emulating a given hardware device:</p>
<ul>
<li>Emulating the functionality of the device</li>
<li>Emulating the actual device interfaces</li>
</ul>
<p>Take the case of a hard-drive.  The functionality is emulated by creating the backing storage, read/write/format routines, etc.  This part is generally very straightforward.</p>
<p>The actual interface of the device is a bit more complex.  This is generally some combination of memory mapped registers (e.g. parts of memory that the device watches for changes to do signaling) and interrupts.  For a hard-drive, you may have a memory mapped area where you place read commands, writes, etc, then read this data back.</p>
<p>I'd go into more detail, but there are a million ways you can go with it.  If you have any specific questions here, feel free to ask and I'll add the info.</p>
<h2>Resources:</h2>
<p>I think I've given a pretty good intro here, but there are a <strong>ton</strong> of additional areas.  I'm more than happy to help with any questions; I've been very vague in most of this simply due to the immense complexity.</p>

<h2>Addendum:</h2>
<p>It's been well over a year since this answer was submitted and with all the attention it's been getting, I figured it's time to update some things.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most exciting thing in emulation right now is <a href=""http://www.libcpu.org/wiki/Main_Page"" rel=""noreferrer"">libcpu</a>, started by the aforementioned Michael Steil.  It's a library intended to support a large number of CPU cores, which use LLVM for recompilation (static and dynamic!).  It's got huge potential, and I think it'll do great things for emulation.</p>
<p><a href=""http://emudocs.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">emu-docs</a> has also been brought to my attention, which houses a great repository of system documentation, which is very useful for emulation purposes.  I haven't spent much time there, but it looks like they have a lot of great resources.</p>
<p>I'm glad this post has been helpful, and I'm hoping I can get off my arse and finish up my book on the subject by the end of the year/early next year.</p>

            DirectoryEntry dir = new DirectoryEntry(""IIS://"" + serverName + ""/W3SVC/1/ROOT"" + vDir, @""adminusername"", @""password"");
            dir.AuthenticationType = AuthenticationTypes.Secure;

            }

            Console.WriteLine("""");
</code></pre>

<p>I get the exception: 
""The system cannot find the path specified""</p>

<p>Now if I go back to IIS and then perform the following steps:
Right click on TestV/Folder <i>and enable Anonymous authentication mode and  then disable it again</i></p>

<p>Right click on TestV/Folder/file.aspx <i>and enable Anonymous authentication mode and  then disable it again</i></p>

<p>Essentially i just performed some manual access on the aspx file Testv/Folder/file.aspx.</p>

<p>After the above steps if i re run the program, the code is successfully able to access the directory entry and successfully prints the name (file.aspx)</p>

<p>What is the problem here?</p>

<p>One more information:</p>

<p>I see this behavior on IIS 6.0 also. So it appears like until and unless I do some manual operation in IIS for a folder/file in virtual directory, it does not create the corresponding metadata in the active directory?</p>

<p>Here is the solution: 
1. The program needs to add (pseudo?)entries to the IIS metadata before it access the file/folder under the virtual directory, before we access the entry:</p>

<pre><code>try
            {
                // make pseudo entries:
                DirectoryEntry folder = rootDir.Children.Add(""Folder"", ""IISWebDirectory"");

                file.CommitChanges();
            }
</code></pre>

<p>Then voila it works</p>

<p>PS:</p>

<pre><code>DirectoryEntry dir = new DirectoryEntry(""IIS://"" + serverName + ""/W3SVC/1/ROOT"" + vDir, @""adminusername"", @""password"");
dir.AuthenticationType = AuthenticationTypes.Secure;
dir.RefreshCache();

<pre><code>src=""/Content/Img/stackoverflow-logo-250.png"" 
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: Sometime in the last 10 years they changed the path - but this is what it used to be.</p>

<p>I dont particularly like this. My HTML ends up with <code>/content</code> all over it, and its slightly harder to migrate existing pages that just have /image. Fortunately my stylesheet doesnt end up with <code>content</code> all over it, as long as I save it in <code>content\site.css</code>.</p>

<p>An alternative is to put an <code>images</code> directory in the root, but then you get <code>images</code> at the same level as <code>Controllers</code> and <code>Views</code> which is pretty horrible.</p>

"496195","<p>I'm using Linq-to-SQL with a SQL Server backend (of course) as an ORM for a project. I need to get the result set from a stored procedure that returns from a dynamically-created table. Here's what the proc looks like:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE procedure [RetailAdmin].[TitleSearch] (

    [ISBN] [varchar](50) NULL,
    [Imprint] [varchar](255) NULL,
    [Edition] [varchar](255) NULL,
    [Copyright] [varchar](100) NULL,
    [stockonhand] [int] NULL
)

set @sql  = 'select  a.storeid, Author,Title, thirteendigitisbn ISBN,

begin
    insert into #mytemp
    EXECUTE sp_executesql  @sql
end 


select * from #mytemp
drop table #mytemp
</code></pre>

<p>I didn't write this procedure, but may be able to influence a change if there's a really serious problem.</p>

<p>My present problem is that when I add this procedure to my model, the designer generates this function:</p>

<pre><code>[Function(Name=""RetailAdmin.TitleSearch"")]
public int TitleSearch([Parameter(DbType=""VarChar(50)"")] string isbn,  
  [Parameter(DbType=""VarChar(50)"")] string author, 
  [Parameter(DbType=""VarChar(50)"")] string title)
{
    IExecuteResult result = this.ExecuteMethodCall(this, 
        ((MethodInfo)(MethodInfo.GetCurrentMethod())), isbn, author, title);

    return ((int)(result.ReturnValue));
}
</code></pre>

<p>which doesn't look anything like the result set I get when I run the proc manually:</p>

<p>Can anybody tell me what's going wrong here?</p>

<p>This is basically the same problem as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/404186/problem-with-the-return-type-of-a-stored-procedure"">this question</a> but due to the poor phrasing from the OP it was never really answered.</p>

<hr>

<p>Thanks Marc for your reply. I will see about making the changes you suggested.</p>

<p>The problem was the temp table. Linq to Sql just doesn't know what to do with them. This was particularly difficult to diagnose, because Visual Studio caches information about stored procs, so when it initially failed to find a result set it set the return as a default integer type and didn't update when I made changes to the stored proc. Getting VS to recognize a change requires you to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Delete proc from the dbml</li>
<li>delete the server connection from Server Explorer</li>
<li>save the dbml to force a recompile</li>
<li>close the project and restart VS</li>
<li>recreate the server connection and import the proc</li>
</ul>

<p>You might not have to do every one of those steps, but that's what worked for me. What you need to do, if you must use a temp table, is to create a barebones proc that simply returns the correct schema, and then alter it to do what you want after you've imported it into the OR Designer.</p>

<pre><code>if len(@l_author) &gt; 0
set @sql =  @sql + ' and author like ''%''+@author+''%'''

EXECUTE sp_executesql  @sql, N'@author varchar(100)', @L_author
</code></pre>

<p>This passes the value of <code>@L_author</code> in as the <code>@author</code> parameter in the dynamic command - preventing injection attacks.</p>

<hr>

<p>Second - you don't really need the temp table. It isn't doing anything for you... you just INSERT and SELECT. Perhaps just EXEC and let the results flow to the caller naturally?</p>

<p>In other circumstances a table-variable would be more appropriate, but this doesn't work with INSERT/EXEC.</p>

<hr>

<p>Are the columns the same for every call? If so, either write the dbml manually, or use a temp SP (just with ""WHERE 1=0"" or something) so that the <code>SET FMT_ONLY ON</code> can work.</p>

<p>If not (different columns per usage), then there isn't an easy answer. Perhaps use regular ADO.NET in this case (<code>ExecuteReader</code>/<code>IDataReader</code> - and perhaps even <code>DataTable.Fill</code>).</p>

<p>Of course, you could let LINQ take the strain... (C#):</p>

<pre><code>...
if(!string.IsNullOrEmpty(author)) {
    query = query.Where(row =&gt; row.Author.Contains(author));
}

"497233","<p>I'm writing a script that has to move some file around, but unfortunately it doesn't seem <code>os.path</code> plays with internationalization very well. When I have files named in Hebrew, there are problems. Here's a screenshot of the contents of a directory:</p>

test_source\joe True
test_source\mie.txt True

<p>Notice how <code>os.path.exists</code> thinks that the hebrew-named file doesn't even exist?
How can I fix this?</p>

<p>Some important observations here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows XP (like all NT derivatives) stores <em>all</em> filenames in unicode</li>
<li><code>os.listdir</code> (and similar functions, like <code>os.walk</code>) should be passed a unicode string in order to work correctly with unicode paths. Here's a quote from the aforementioned link:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>os.listdir(), which returns filenames,
  raises an issue: should it return the
  Unicode version of filenames, or
  should it return 8-bit strings
  containing the encoded versions?
  os.listdir() will do both, depending
  on whether you provided the directory
  path as an 8-bit string or a Unicode
  string. If you pass a Unicode string
  as the path, filenames will be decoded
  using the filesystem's encoding and a
  list of Unicode strings will be
  returned, while passing an 8-bit path
  will return the 8-bit versions of the
  filenames.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>And lastly, <code>print</code> wants an ascii string, not unicode, so the path has to be encoded to ascii.</li>

<hr />
<h2>Animation and Graphics (for the actual battles)</h2>
<p>Now, of course there will be some sort of animation and movement when the battle occurs, and I haven't decided what yet to use as a medium for this.</p>
<p>The options I currently have in mind are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing, as I said in the first above bullet points, an offline application that will serve as a battle grounds, and all animations will be done using mainly C# code</li>
<li>Or develop a Silverlight Application that will handle the animations (thus, changing the scenario from an offline applcation to now an online one</li>
<li>Or, maybe the least feasable of them, create the battle animations using JavaScript, with something like the <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20120803112420/https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Canvas_tutorial"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Canvas</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What do you think could be more suitable for this particular scenario ?</strong></p>
<hr />
<h2>Developing Classes and Interfaces</h2>
<p>For the players to develop the robots, I will provide certain Class Interfaces that they will be able to use like in Robocode.</p>
<p>Examples of such events and methods may include:</p>
<pre><code>public void run () {}
public void onScannedRobot(ScannedRobotEvent e) {}

walk(/* ammount in pixels or w/e to walk to */);
turnRight(/* value in degrees for an angular turn */);
//etc...
</code></pre>
<p>Here is a snippet from code in Robocode (Java) :</p>
<pre><code>public class MyFirstRobot extends Robot {
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
             ahead(100);
             turnGunRight(360);
             back(100);
             turnGunRight(360);
         }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>For then to actually make the battles happen, I am thinking of using Reflection to actually read what methods the user is actually making use of and implementing them to run and be invoked at particular moments of the battle and such.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now, what I kindly and humbly ask of you experienced developers, is to guide me a bit through this project of mine and advise me on what needs to be done...for starters, <em><strong>is this project feasible at all ?</strong></em>  And if it actually is, <em><strong>from where do I need to actually start with my project?</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<p>As regards technologies and software I intend to be using are :</p>
<ul>
<li>.NET Framework 3.5, with C# 3.0</li>
<li>LINQ (Language Integrated Query)</li>
<li>SQL Server 2008</li>
<li>Microsoft Visual Studio 2008</li>
<li>jQuery Framework</li>
<li>Possibly Silverlight</li>
</ul>

<p>I thank you all, even for managing to read up to this point in my question and I will need and appreciate greatly all the help I can get to finish this project.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and effort.</p>

","Developing a Robocode type game with .Net, for a School Assignment","<projects-and-solutions><project-planning><robocode>","2009-02-02 21:33:35","4055","505354","6","<p>When I began working with WPF (which is much the same as Silverlight) I ended up spending a lot of time figuring out how to do things. It is a very different way of making a GUI than what else I've tried and there seems to be a billion different ways to do things. My point is, that if you have no experience with WPF/Silverlight I suspect it is going to take a lot of time for you to wrap your mind around. I guess it depends on what you already know.</p>

<p>Apart from than, I wholeheartedly support ChrisW's suggstion about incremental development. I'll give you an idea of how you can approach the design of the game. Start out with a very simple API for the bots, say two functions with no events, input or knowledge of the world. Just start by getting the bots to move. The point is to get a fully functioning program with the simple functionality, including all parts from loading the client code to showing the resulting 'battle'.</p>

<p>Each bot should implement an interface with a single method run() and be in their own dll file. When the battle starts, each dll with the interface implemented is loaded (using reflection) from a certain location and instantiated. Then start a battle with a loop until 1 minute has passed (or whatever, just to see that something is going on):</p>

<pre><code>while (time is not up)
   generate random sequence for bots
   call run() on each bot
   draw(world)
</code></pre>

<p>When the time is up, the battle is over. Now you have a skeleton application which you can begin to flesh out and which will let you have a working program, even if you won't have time to make all the functionality you would like. In the run method, the bots can call the couple of move actions you have defined in the API. Calling these will change the state of the world - probably just a grid of tiles, and the location of each bot.</p>

<p>The next step could be to add a view of the world to the bots' run method, changing the loop to this:</p>

<pre><code>while (time is not up)
   generate random sequence for bots
   call run(WorldView) on each bot
   draw(world)
</code></pre>

<p>Let's say that the bots can still only perform a couple of move actions in their run method. Now they have the option of getting a view of the world (or their part of it) which allows them to move towards or away from enemies and avoid walls.</p>

<p>In the next iteration you could then create a single API function to shoot you cannon (or whatever is appropriate your game). Implement how this changes the world state, how the bullets are tracked and how the animation is represented, etc. The loop could look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (time is not up and there are more than 1 bot alive)
   advance projectiles
   calculate projectile-bot collisions and damage
   generate random sequence for bots
   call run(WorldView) on each bot
   draw(world)
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this gives you an idea of how you can iteratively flesh out the program, all the while having a working program that reflects all the areas of the game. I don't have much experience with implementing games, so you should look at my advice with a critical eye but this is how I would attack the problem.</p>

"508356","<p>Can anyone suggest a suitable way of figuring out a pieces allowable moves on a grid similar to the one in the image below.</p>

<p><img src=""https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3534/3250436085_c91b07c7fd.jpg"" alt=""grid layout""></p>

<p>Assuming piece1 is at position a1 and piece2 is at position c3, how can I figure out which grid squares are allowable moves if piece1 can move (say) 3 squares and piece2 can move 2?</p>

<p>I've spent way too long developing text based MUDS it seems, I simply can't get my brain to take the next step into how to visualise potential movement even in the most simple of situations.</p>

<p>If it matters, I'm trying to do this in javascript, but to be perfectly honest I think my failure here is a failure to conceptualise properly - not a failure in language comprehension.</p>

<p><strong>Update - I'm adding the first round of code written after the below responses were posted. I thought it might be useful to people in a similar situation as me to see the code</strong></p>

<p>It's sloppy and it only works for one item placed on the board so far, but at least the <code>check_allowable_moves()</code> function works for this initial run. For those of you wondering why the hell I'm creating those weird alphanumeric objects rather than just using numeric x axis and y axis - it's because an id in HTML can't start with a number. In fact pretending I <em>could</em> use numbers to start ids helped a great deal in making sense of the functionality and concepts described by the fantastic answers I got.</p>

<p>The answer becomes a lot more complex if moving diagonally doesn't cost as much as a horizontal + vertical movement (e.g., if diagonal costs 1.5, whereas h/v costs 1).</p>

"517998","<p>I have a set of objects in a hierachy. There's a top ""root"" node and that has child nodes, which in turn have child nodes etc. I'm trying to save this structure into a DB using the nested set model, where each ""side"" of each node is numbered to define the hierarchy, as in <a href=""http://mikehillyer.com/articles/managing-hierarchical-data-in-mysql/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Managing Hierarchical Data in MySQL</a>:</p>

<sub>(source: <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/hierarchical-data-4.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mysql.com</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>My problem is calculating the left and right values. I typically use RecursiveIteratorIterator to iterate over the hierarchy, but I cant work out how to calculate the numbers without resorting to a recursive function that parses an index variable by reference.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>It's probably of no use, but this is the (incorrect) code I currently have:</p>

<pre><code>$iterator = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(
    new Node_List(array($root)),
    RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF_FIRST);

$i = 0;     
foreach ($iterator as $node) {
    $node-&gt;left = ++$i;
    $node-&gt;right = ++$i;
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, that would give something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Node 
    Node 
    Node 
</code></pre>

<p>Left and right values of:</p>

<pre><code>Node (1, 2)
    Node (3, 4)
    Node (5, 6)
</code></pre>

<p>When they should be:</p>

<pre><code>Node (1, 6)
    Node (2, 3)
    Node (4, 5)
</code></pre>
","PHP RecursiveIteratorIterator and nested sets","<php><recursion><iterator><nested-sets>","2009-02-05 21:23:31","3822","518413","2","<p>I figured it out, here's the solution (simplifed):</p>

<pre><code>$iterator = new RecursiveIteratorIterator(
    new Site_Node_List(array($root)),
    RecursiveIteratorIterator::SELF_FIRST);

$sides = array();
$s = 0;
$i = 0;
$parents = array();
foreach ($iterator as $item) {
    $js = array_splice($parents, $depth, count($parents), array($i));
    foreach (array_reverse($js) as $j) {
        $sides[$j]['right'] = ++$s;
    }
    $sides[$i]['left'] = ++$s;
    $i++;
}
foreach (array_reverse($parents) as $j) {
    $sides[$j]['right'] = ++$s;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is am over simplified version of my actual code, as it just stores the ""side"" values in a separate array, but it demonstrates the principle.</p>

<p>The basic idea is that you store all the parent nodes (tracked by the depth value) in an array, and only write the ""left"" values in your loop. Then, when the depth decreases it means you've gone back up the hierarchy, so the parents array is spliced to remove the ones that are no longer relevant, and they are looped over (in reverse) setting the ""right"" values. Finally, you have to loop over the remaining parents at the end.</p>

Here's my impromtu math explanation for the steps you'll need. Sorry for the math, the other answers are better in terms of implementation.</p>

<ol>
<li>Define a linear function (like y = x + 1) with the domain (i.e. x) being from the colour you want to start with to the colour your want to end with. You can think of this in terms of a range the within Ox0 to OxFFFFFF (for 24 bit colour). If you want to handle things like brightness, you'll have to do some tricks with the range (i.e. the y value).</li>
<li>Next you need to map a vector across the matrix you have, as this defines the direction that the colours will change in. Also, the colour values defined by your linear function will be assigned at each point along the vector. The start and end point of the vector also define the min and max of the domain in 1. You can think of the vector as one line of your gradient.</li>
<li>For each cell in the matrix, colours can be assigned a value from the vector where a perpendicular line from the cell intersects the vector. See the diagram below where c is the position of the cell and . is the the point of intersection. If you pretend that the colour at . is Red, then that's what you'll assign to the cell. </li>

It's not a single item to be picked, it's an action. And if you select all and then start unselecting individual items in the list, the ""checked"" state of the select all checkbox becomes inherently confusing. I prefer to use a simple but obvious link/button that toggles between ""select all"" and ""unselect all"" as it is clicked. There is no state to confuse you with when individual items have been deselected, and the outcome of pushing the button is never in doubt. The exclusive nature of the operation makes it perfectly reasonable to toggle back and forth (rather than using two always visible buttons; one for select all, one for unselect all), since you are at most two clicks away from your desired behavior. And it visually separates out this ""action"" from the individual items, preventing misclicks and distinguishing behavior.</p>

<p>I am working on some code to send/receive SMS messages through Zeep Mobile (<a href=""http://zeepmobile.com/developers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://zeepmobile.com/developers/</a>). </p>

<p>I have looked at their google groups and even contacted their support but they've not been very good at communicating back and I am really flying blind now.</p>

<p>Of course, this is all dependent on whether you have experience with Zeep or not. If you want me post my code, I can do that too. Let me know.</p>

<p>Thanks and I really appreciate the help.</p>

<p>I am completely aware of programming with thread safety in mind and as you can see I am catering for UI updates via a form InvokeRequired check here, everything has been working fine and no changes to break this that I am aware, and now suddenly just as I'm programming other parts of the application (perhaps added to this method at one stage? I just can't remember) I intimitently, receive this error:</p>

<p><img src=""https://dl.getdropbox.com/u/477279/Stackoverflow/invokeIssue.gif"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Firstly, if InvokeRequired = true, that should mean BeginInvoke() executed, the method is [queued] to be re-called and InvokeRequired should equal false?</p>

<p>I should not receive this exception as it should be catered for?</p>

<p>Hope to hear from some multi threading guru's :)</p>

A WinForm Control defers creation of the Control's underlying Win32 HWND until a method call actually needs it. InvokeRequired will return false if the HWND has not been created yet.</p>

<p>If your background thread queries InvokeRequired <em>before</em> the UI thread has caused the Control to lazily create its HWND, InvokeRequired will (incorrectly) tell your background thread that it does not need to use Invoke() to pass control back to the UI thread. When the background thread then accesses the Control, BAM! <em>""InvalidOperationException: Cross-thread operation not valid!""</em></p>

<p>The UI thread can manually force the Control to create its HWND handle to so Control.InvokeRequired will know the UI thread is the Control's owner:</p>

<p>I am using the autocomplete YUI feature. However, as you can see I am having trouble aligning  the suggestion drop down with the text input when I put a label in front of the text input. I am following <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/autocomplete/ac_basic_array_clean.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the example here</a> exactly except for this snippet of code where I simply replace the H3 with a label element in the form:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""myAutoComplete""&gt;
&lt;label&gt;Enter a state:&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input id=""myInput"" type=""text""&gt;
    &lt;div id=""myContainer""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/autocomplete/assets/js/data.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

<p>(I also had to change the  data.js path from a relative to absolute path.)</p>

<p>What is the best way to have the suggestion drop down to line up with the text input? I would like a solution that works on all popular modern browsers (FF3, Safari, Chrome, IE), plus IE6. </p>
","YUI autocomplete misalignment problem","<javascript><html><css><yui>","2009-02-10 18:01:14","1994","534660","4","<p>AutoComplete doesn't automatically brute-force the position of your AC container every time it shows, because unless you're doing inline work this is unnecessary.  However, now that you've moved your input field inline, you do need to take another step to align the container, either with custom CSS or brute force JS positioning.</p>

<p>Here's the brute force approach.</p>

<p>After you define your AC instance:</p>

<pre><code>oAC.doBeforeExpandContainer = function() {
    var Dom = YAHOO.util.Dom;

"538244","<p><strong>Problem:</strong> I have HTML markup to deal with that consists of multiple tables nested inside another table. I would like the ""inner tables"" to all be the same width. I would also like all of the ""inner tables"" to be no wider than the width of the widest ""inner table"" in its natural state.</p>

<p>I do <em>not</em> want to simply set the width of all the tables to some fixed percentage, as I do not know in advance what the width of the widest ""inner table"" should be until the HTML page is actually generated.</p>

<p>I want all tables to be the same width as inner-table-zero. Currently, none of the tables have an assigned width, and that's the way I like it, because I want all inner tables to naturally choose the width of whichever table is widest by default.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Is there any CSS or JQuery or Javascript trick anyone knows that will obtain this desired styling?</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I'm about to delete this question because people seem to want to downvote me for not having a good reason for not wanting 100%. I <strong>do</strong> have a good reason ... I also do not know until runtime <em>which</em> table will be the ""outermost"" table (this is a recursively-generated structure of potentially unlimited depth).</p>

<p>Assuming all your inner tables have a class of 'inner', you could do something like this:</p>

    var largest = 0;

<p>That gives the link top and bottom padding of 3px and left and right padding of 5px. This is nice because it gives you a bigger click target.</p>

<p>You state that you don't want to wrap but from what I can tell on the screenshot, there simply isn't enough room. You'll either have to make the font smaller or use shorter phrases for the tabs. Maybe this?</p>

"553133","<p>I have two questions and some context.</p>

<p>I am installing Subclipse 1.4.x into Eclipse Ganymede and I'm thinking that I should use the SVNKit Adapter. I'm using Ubuntu 8.04 which comes with Subversion 1.4.x and since the JavaHL Adapter requires Subversion 1.5.x using a pure Java solution like SVNKit seems like a good solution.</p>

<p><strong>Which pros and cons do you see with using the SVNKit Adapter?</strong></p>

<p>I can't find any documentation on what the JNA Library, SVNKit Client Adapter and SVNKit Library actually provides. And I'm interested in knowing what I install. <strong>What do they provide?</strong></p>

<p>Speed-wide, they are also similar. This is no big surprise because Subversion is usually I/O bound (Waiting for the SVN server to deliever the data will always take longer than what the SVN client library does on your computer).</p>

<p>Subversion 1.5 has some drastic speed improvements but that doesn't apply in your case.</p>

<p>The main difference is that you don't need the correct version of javahl installed in your computer. For Linux, this is often a problem because it means you need to set up the env variable LIBRARY_PATH for Eclipse so the shared library can be loaded correctly plus you might need to compile the library yourself if you can't find a package which fits your needs. In your case, Ubuntu should come with a precompiled library but that library is for Subversion 1.5. It should fall back gracefully when you connect to a 1.4 server, though.</p>

<p>The Subclipse guys support SVNkit but I've had issues with it in the past (that was several years ago; I'm positive this has improved considerably since). They were fixed pretty fast, too.</p>

<p>All considered, I think you're better off with the SVNkit since it's way easier to setup.</p>

<p>[EDIT] As to ""What should I download"", I think you need everything below ""SVNKit Adapter (optional)"", that is all three components (see the <a href=""https://wiki.svnkit.com/SVNKit_FAQ"" rel=""noreferrer"">SVNKit FAQ</a>).</p>

<p>When View2 viewcontroller senses rotation (back to portrait), it pops itself of the navigation controller, revealing view 1.  View 1 then unhides the status bar and nav bar.
From here, it gets weird.  Depending on when I unhide the navigation bar, I get strange results.  As you can see below (The beaker photo should be just below the navbar at the top of the screen). </p>

<p>I have tried unhiding the navigation bar in:</p>

<ul>
<li>viewWillRotate/viewDidRotate of view 2</li>
<li>viewWillAppear/viewDidAppear of view 1</li>
<li>poptoRootView in the navigation controller (I subclassed just to try)</li>
</ul>

<p>Nothing works.  Any Idea what is going on?  This should be simple, but maybe I am doing things in the wrong places.</p>

"561729","<p>A typical problem in OO programming is the diamond problem. I have parent class A with two sub-classes B and C. A has an abstract method, B and C implement it. Now I have a sub-class D, that inherits of B <strong>and</strong> C. The diamond problem is now, what implementation shall D use, the one of B or the one of C?</p>

<p>People claim Java knows no diamond problem. I can only have multiple inheritance with interfaces and since they have no implementation, I have no diamond problem. Is this really true? I don't think so. <strong>See below:</strong></p>

<p>[removed vehicle example]</p>

<p>Is a diamond problem always the cause of bad class design and something neither programmer nor compiler needs to solve, because it shouldn't exist in the first place?</p>

<p>Of course you can make Person virtual in C++ and thus you will only have one instance of person in memory, but the real problem persists IMHO. How would you implement getDepartment() for GradTeachingFellow? Consider, he might be student in one department and teach in another one. So you can either return one department or the other one; there is no perfect solution to the problem and the fact that no implementation might be inherited (e.g. Student and Teacher could both be interfaces) doesn't seem to solve the problem to me.</p>

Basically, (public) inheritance should only narrow the purpose of the class, not extend it.  In this case, by inheriting from two types of vehicles you are in fact extending the purpose, and as you noticed, it doesn't work - move should be very different for a water vehicle than for a road vehicle.<BR>
You could instead aggregate a water vehicle and a ground vehicle object in your amphibious vehicle and decide externally which of the two will be appropriate to the current situation.<BR>
Alternatively you could decide that the ""vehicle"" class is needlessly generic and you'll have separate interfaces for both.  That doesn't solve the problem for your amphibious vehicle on its own though - if you call the movement method ""move"" in both interfaces, you'll still have trouble.  So I'd suggest aggregation instead of inheritance.</p>

<p>I have an application which normally works without administrative privileges. There is one activity which does need administrative privilege but I don't want to start the application itself with higher privileges when I know most of time user wont even be using that feature.</p>

<p>I am thinking about certain method by which I can elevate the privileges of application on some event (such as press of a button). Example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/7wMTs.jpg"" alt=""""></p>

<p>If user clicks this button then he is prompted with UAC dialog or consent. How can I do this?</p>

It is built into Windows Vista that administrator privileges are given to a process upon startup, as I understand. If you look at various programs that utilise UAC, you should see that they actually launch a separate process each time an administrative action needs to be performed (Task Manager is one, Paint.NET is another, the latter being a .NET application in fact).</p>
<p>The typical solution to this problem is to specify command line arguments when launching an elevated process (abatishchev's suggestion is one way to do this), so that the launched process knows only to display a certain dialog box, and then quit after this action has been completed. Thus it should hardly be noticeable to the user that a new process has been launched and then exited, and would rather appear as if a new dialog box within the same app has been opened (especially if you some hackery to make the main window of the elevated process a child of the parent process). If you don't need UI for the elevated access, even better.</p>
<p>For a full discussion of UAC on Vista, I recommend you see <a href=""http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this very through article</a> on the subject (code examples are in C++, but I suspect you'll need to use the WinAPI and P/Invoke to do most of the things in C# anyway). Hopefully you now at least see the right approach to take, though designing a UAC compliant program is far from trivial...</p>

  <p><em>Could you expose Wordle as a web

  <p>A scalable web service should take no

  Wordle will always apportion the

  and your CPU.</p>
  
  <p>As of this writing, Wordle is
  sustaining 10 hits per second. There's

"593637","<p>I'm working on an iPhone game, and trying to use a UIScrollView to display some icons, which I then want to enable the user to drag off the bar being scrolled, onto another view (basically, dragging them from their hand into play on the game board).  The problem is that the UIScrollView clips everything outside it's own bounds.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of what I'm trying to do: </p>

<p>Functionally, it actually works, in that you can drag the icons up to the white board fine...but you can't see them as you are dragging...which is not acceptable.</p>

<p>Does anyone know if you can temporarily disable the clipping that a scroll view does, or is there some way to get around it?  Hacky or not, I would really like to make it happen.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any other possible solutions for this?  Or maybe any alternate approaches?  I've considered if maybe a page view might work, but haven't tried it yet...and it's not at all as good of a solution as the scroll view.</p>

<p>Worst case I can just go back to not having the bar scrollable, but that really puts a damper on some of my game mechanics, and I'm really not too excited about that.</p>

<p>However, the dragging you want to do from the scroll view to the game view may require you to remove the icon view from the scroll view, place it in the superview at a position corresponding to its visible position within the scroll view (calculated using the scroll view's origin and content offset), and have that track the user's finger movements.  On a release of the touch, either drop it on the game view at the proper position or return it to the scroll view.</p>

"596970","<p>I have a DIV container of 100% width holding x divs. The last child DIV floats right, the rest float left. All child DIV's remain in a line so long as they fit in the bar (all oriented left, except for the last div which sits by itself on the right). If the window is resized smaller and the children don't have enough room, they collapse from their horizontal orientation (which I don't want). To fix this, I know I can set a min-width of the DIV container, the issue is that there is a variable amount of DIVs in the container, of variable width. I'd like to simulate being able to set a min-width where of the container where min-width = width of all children, but I cannot compute these because they are variable (which would simulate flexible space between the right div and the rest, but not let them get closer than they should be allowed (hence collapsing the divs)).</p>

#topbar { width: 100%; }
#topbar div { white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; }
#topright div { text-align: right; }
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;table id=""topbar""&gt;

  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div&gt;Item 1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div&gt;Item 2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;

"597369","<p>As I see it, there are two ways to handle mouse events to draw a picture.</p>

<p>The first is to detect when the mouse moves and draw a line to where the mouse is, shown <a href=""http://www.cs.iupui.edu/~aharris/pygame/ch05/paint.py"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.  However, the problem with this is that  with a large brush size, many gaps appear between each ""line"" that is not straight since it is using the line's stroke size to create thick lines.</p>

<p>The other way is to draw circles when the mouse moves as is shown <a href=""http://www.ida.liu.se/~ETE257/timetable/LecturePythonPygame2.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.

<p>Draw a circle at each endpoint and a line between the two.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> rofl, just couldn't stop myself.  </p>

<p>Actually, you don't want to use <code>pygame.draw.line</code> because it cheats. It fills a 1 pixel wide row or column (depending on angle of attack) of pixels. If you do go at a roughly perpendicular angle, 0 deg or 90 deg, this isn't an issue, but at 45's, you'll notice a sort of <em>string bean</em> effect.</p>

"599348","<p>Never asked a question here before, I'll try to lay this out as succinctly as possible.  </p>

<p>I've got a Recipe class, that contains lists of three different types of Ingredient Uses.  These classes all inherit from the base, IngredientUse.  So the mapping looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;class name=""IngredientUse"" table=""IngredientUses""&gt;
    &lt;id name=""Id"" type=""Int64"" column=""Id""&gt;
      &lt;generator class=""native""/&gt;
    &lt;/id&gt;
    &lt;!--some other properties--&gt;
    &lt;property name=""RecipeId"" column=""RecipeId""/&gt;
    &lt;joined-subclass name=""AdditionUse"" table=""AdditionUses""&gt;
      &lt;key column=""Id"" foreign-key=""FK_AdditionUses_IngredientUses""/&gt;
      &lt;many-to-one name=""AdditionUsed"" column=""AdditionUsed"" class=""Addition"" foreign-key=""FK_AdditionUses_Additions""/&gt;
    &lt;/joined-subclass&gt;
  &lt;/class&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The one causing problems here is the RecipeId.  From the recipe, I have three separate lists of uses for different ingredient types, defined like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;bag name=""AdditionsUsed"" cascade=""all"" lazy=""false""&gt;
  &lt;key column=""RecipeId""/&gt;
  &lt;one-to-many class=""AdditionUse""/&gt;
&lt;/bag&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I'm running into problems trying to load these lists.  It has something to do with the inheritance.  When I look at the SQL Generated, I see this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT additionsused0_.RecipeId as RecipeId1_
--other columns not really important
FROM AdditionUses additionsused0_ 
inner join IngredientUses additionsused0_1_ 
on additionsused0_.Id=additionsused0_1_.Id 
WHERE additionsused0_.RecipeId=@p0; @p0 = '11'
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that its' looking for the RecipeId in the subclass' table, and not the base table where the column is actually contained.  I know I could just define a separate table for each ingredient type, but that will cause me problems because there are some situations (ie pricing) where I don't need the additional columns in the subclass table, and would like to be able to load all the ingredients into the same list at once.</p>

<p>I'm certain I must be missing something here, figured someone more familiar with NHibernate on this site might recognize it right off the bat.  </p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> in case I wasn't clear about what I'm trying to do, this diagram might help (excuse my shoddy UML, hope it doesn't muddy the waters).  There is also an Ingredient base class, and the same subtypes off of that.</p>

<p>Create the tables in a paper, and you'll see that if you want that your ingredient has many additions, you will need add a column in the additions table. </p>

<p>By the way, never map your ids directly, map the entity instead using a many-to-one</p>

"608556","<p>So the model I need for my solution is as follows:</p>

<p>I need to poll the database and based on a result, create a request to the database for more data, get the response and pass it to a group of ports, for which based on a promoted property, only one of the ports will act.</p>

<p>It looks like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/XUZt2.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/XUZt2.jpg"" width=""620""></a>
</p>

<p>However, if you assign ""Temp Out"" to a send port group, the message is sent to all the ports in the group, irregardless of the filters set on each port.  From my understanding, this is expected behavior (read <a href=""http://www.biztalkgurus.com/forums/t/2236.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>).</p>

<p>So I explored other options such as using Content Based Routing (CBR sample) like in the SDK. You can view this <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms948408.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. </p>

<p>I tried this and completely removed the orchestration (its really not needed).  However, there are major routing/subscription errors, and upon further research, it appears that you can't do this if you have solicit-response ports.  Some articles on that <a href=""http://www.tech-archive.net/Archive/BizTalk/microsoft.public.biztalk.general/2006-02/msg00178.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.   I pretty much have the same issue <a href=""http://www.biztalkgurus.com/forums/t/5016.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> user does.</p>

<p>In the end it doesn't matter to me whether I use an orchestration or not.  However, I need a solution in which I can pass the message to multiple send ports, and I can have only one actually use the message and send.  This is needed so that I can edit and add ports easily without having to modify anything else or hard code decisions into the orchestration.</p>
","Biztalk Send Port Group and Filtering","<filter><biztalk><send-port>","2009-03-03 22:45:19","6469","629980","2","<p>I found that the CBR example model does indeed work.  The problem with routing were the subscriptions.  If I was to subscribe a send port to a solicit-response port, I had to set the BTS.SPName (Send Port Name) filter instead of the BTS.ReceivePort filter.  By doing this, the message was correctly filter through.  You're answer would have worked too, but it requires using an orchestration which I was trying to avoid.</p>

","Workaround for the ImageList transparency bug?","<winforms>","2009-03-06 01:13:48","3088","617525","1","<p>I don't think that this is a bug. You should have the ImageList color depth set to 32-bit, and you need to be using visual styles.</p>

<p>If the application has visual styles enabled, WinForms uses version 6.0 of Windows common controls, which supports alpha transparency. Otherwise it will use the previous version which does not support alpha-transparency, and incorrectly renders ARGB images with a blue halo.</p>

<p>If you need a workaround, you could try creating new bitmaps the same size, filling them with the BackColor of the ListView, creating a Graphics object on the bitmap, and drawing your ARGB image onto the bitmap. Then you can insert these pre-blened bitmaps into the ImageList. If you do this, however, the selection will look funny on the icon in the ListView.</p>

<p>Another work-around would be to directly access the bitmap data (using LockBits()) and manually blend any semi-transparent pixels, which will cause the images to be rendered properly and look pretty much the way they should when selected.</p>

"619618","<p>I am creating images using PIL that contain numerous exactly placed text strings.

pilfont.py fonts/slkscr.bdf

<p>I can then use the font in PIL like so:</p>

<pre><code>import Image, ImageDraw, os, sys, ImageFont
im = Image.new(""RGB"", (40,10))
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(im)
fn = ImageFont.load('fonts/slkscr.pil')
draw.text((0,0), ""Hello"", font=fn)
del draw
# write to stdout
im.save(sys.stdout, ""PNG"")

<p>The <code>getSubimage</code> method will take the <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> of the desired subimage, so the desired sprite can be obtained. Since most of the sprites seem to be the same size, I would think most of them can be retrieved by a nested <code>for</code> loop to iterate through the large image.</p>

<p>For example, if the sprite image is loaded using the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/imageio/ImageIO.html"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ImageIO</code></a> class (such as the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/imageio/ImageIO.html#read(java.io.File)"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>read</code></a> method), and each sprite is 10 pixels by 10 pixels in size, where are 5 rows by 5 columns of sprites, the sprites can be obtained by the following:</p>

<pre><code>BufferedImage bigImg = ImageIO.read(new File(""sheet.png""));
// The above line throws an checked IOException which must be caught.

final int width = 10;
final int height = 10;
final int rows = 5;
final int cols = 5;
BufferedImage[] sprites = new BufferedImage[rows * cols];

for (int i = 0; i &lt; rows; i++)
{
    for (int j = 0; j &lt; cols; j++)
    {
        sprites[(i * cols) + j] = bigImg.getSubimage(

            width,
            height
        );
    }

<p>The catch is, of course, the above code will only work if all the sprites are the same size, so there will need to be some adjustment performed in order to work for the given sprite sheet. (As the top right-hand corner seems to be different in size from the others.)</p>

"622471","<p>So I'm building the pacman game in Java to teach myself game programming.</p>

<p>I have the basic game window with the pacman sprite and the ghost sprites drawn, the pacman moves with the arrow keys, doesn't move beyond the walls of the window, etc. Now I'm trying to build the maze, as in this picture:</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/59/Pac-man.png"" alt=""Pacman maze""></p>

<p>Without giving me the direct/complete solution to this, can someone guide me as to how this can be built? I'm talking only about the boundaries and the pipes('T' marks) here which you can't go through and you have to go around. Not the dots which the pacman eats yet.</p>

<p>Here are my questions:</p>

<p>1) What's the most efficient algorithm/method for creating this maze? Will it have to be drawn each time the paint() method is called or is there a way to draw it only at the start of the game and never again?</p>

<p>2) How will this actually be drawn to the screen? I assume the <code>fillRect()</code> will be used?</p>

<p>3) Any hints on collision detection (so the pacman/ghosts can't go through the walls) would be helpful.</p>

<p>4) Any hints on how the vacant space between the pipes will be calculated so the dots can be filled between them will also be very helpful.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
","Pacman maze in Java","<java><algorithm><2d><maze>","2009-03-07 20:45:08","17563","622500","3","<p>I wouldn't do it that way.</p>

<p>I'd draw the graphical map and then create a 2D data array which represents the map. The data map would be responsible for determining collisions, eating dots, where candy is and where the ghosts are. Once all the logic for everything is handled just use the 2D array to display everything in their proper pixel coordinates over the graphical map.</p>

<p>For example the user is pressing the left key. First you determine that pacman is at element 3, 3. Element 3, 2 contains information denoting a wall so you can implement the code to make him ignore the command.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Each element would represent about where a dot could be. For example:</p>

<p>No, looking at the board I would say the array would look something like this.</p>

<pre><code>d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,w,w,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d
d,w,w,w,w,d,w,w,w,w,w,d,w,w,d,w,w,w,w,w,d,w,w,w,w,d
p,w,w,w,w,d,w,w,w,w,w,d,w,w,d,w,w,w,w,w,d,w,w,w,w,p    
d,w,w,w,w,d,w,w,w,w,w,d,w,w,d,w,w,w,w,w,d,w,w,w,w,d    
d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d,d
</code></pre>

<p>And so on. You might want to pick a more flexible data structure than just characters however since some areas need to contain a bunch of different information. IE even though the ghost spawning area is blank, pacman isn't allowed in there. The movement of the ghosts and pacman is different for the side escapes, the candy spawn point is a blank spot but if you want to remain flexible you'll want to denote where this is on a per map basis.</p>

<p>Another thing you'll want to remember is that pacman and the ghosts are often inbetween points so containing information that represents a percentage of a space they're taking up between 1,2 and 1,3 is important for collision detection as well as determining when you want to remove dots, powerups and candy from the board.</p>

"626541","<p>I have a SIP application that needs to send UDP packets to set up the SIP calls. SIP has a timeout mechanism to cope with delivery failures. An additional thing I would like to be able to do is detect whether a UDP socket is closed in order having to wait the 32s retransmit interval SIP uses.</p>

<p>The cases I am referring to are when an attempt to send to a UDP socket results in an ICMP Destination Unreachable packet being generated by the remote host.

<p>Next, imagelists are natively bitmaps, not icons. And the way you are creating your imagelist makes the conversion of icon to bitmap very ambiguous. ILC_COLOR32 implies the imagelist should be created as a 32bit dib section, which typically contain transparency information via an embedded alpha channel. ILC_MASK instead implies that the internal bitmaps are DDB bitmaps, with the transparency information stored as a 1bpp mask bitmap.</p>

<p>The quickest solution to your problem - take your two icons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Merge them into a single bitmap resource thats 32 pels wide by 16 high. Fill the background with a mask color :- purple or something.</li>
<li>Create the bitmap using ILC_COLOR|ILC_MASK</li>
<li>Load the bitmap being sure NOT to use LR_TRANSPARENT.</li>
<li>Add the bitmap using ImageList_AddMasked passing in a COLORREF that represents the mask color.</li>

","Drawing a Rotated Rectangle","<math><graphics>","2009-03-13 20:02:02","23051","649303","6","<p>First transform the centre point to 0,0 </p>

<p>X' = X-x</p>

<p>Y' = Y-y</p>

<p>Then rotate for an angle of A</p>

<p>X'' = (X-x) * cos A - (Y-y) * sin A</p>

<p>Y'' = (Y-y) * cos A + (X-x) * sin A</p>

<p>Again transform back the centre point to x,y</p>

<p>X''' = (X-x) * cos A - (Y-y) * sin A + x </p>

<p>Y''' = (Y-y) * cos A + (X-x) * sin A + y</p>

<p>Hence compute for all 4 points of (X,Y) with following transformation </p>

<p>X''' = (X-x) * cos A - (Y-y) * sin A + x</p>

<p>Y''' = (Y-y) * cos A + (X-x) * sin A + y</p>

<p>where x, y are the centre points of rectangle and X,Y are the corner points
You have n't defined correctly even the corner points when Angle is 0 as I have given in the comments.</p>

<p>After substituting you will get</p>

<pre><code>UL  =  x + ( Width / 2 ) * cos A - ( Height / 2 ) * sin A ,  y + ( Height / 2 ) * cos A  + ( Width / 2 ) * sin A

"645471","<p>I'm an ICT student, I've gotten classes on several subjects: coding(C#, Java), webdevelopment(XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP), databases(MySQL), Computertech(ASM coding, pc-architecture), Datacom(Cisco networking).</p>
<p>But I still wonder, how do you go about setting up a real big webproject, which requires dedicated servers.</p>
<p>I've been doing this for 2 years now, I'll probably graduate in another year or 2, but I haven't come about setting up something big and having to spend loads of time to configure it.</p>
<p>I don't even know how to set up a dedicated server. It'll probably live after its namesake: being dedicated to one task. But still, what does that look like? How do I work with it when I have to check things on it? How do I optimize it? How do I set up swift interaction with the other server(s) and how do I keep server load and bandwidth usage down.</p>
<p>These are all questions my school can't answer for me, simply because they have a set of courses to give and can't step outside that. As for me doing it myself, I can't afford stuff like that. And I don't like renting stuff like that either. You give money for some servers that are located several hundred miles away. I don't want that, I want the server within walking distance. I need to be able to walk up to that machine and configure it myself. Yet that's pretty unrealistic, financially speaking.</p>
<p>Also, when I think of servers, I think of this stuff:</p>
<p><img src=""https://farm1.static.flickr.com/59/208812013_9fda8f6a75.jpg"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>
<p>Is it cliche to think all good servers look like that?</p>
","Learning to work with dedicated servers","<language-agnostic>","2009-03-14 05:49:06","2636","645515","2","<p>Dedicated servers don't have to be dedicated to just one task, they may also be used for many different tasks. A dedicated server is named so because it gives one customer full access over the entire server rather than for example shared hosting where the customer only gets to use a certain amount of resources before they are asked to leave.</p>

<p>As for working with dedicated servers, that relies entirely on what OS it is running, if it is running Windows you will most likely be RDC'ing into the server to maintain it, if it is running some flavour of Unix or Linux you will most likely SSH into it giving you a terminal. It varies greatly depending on your end goal!</p>

<p>Optimisation in terms of what? If you want to optimise web applications you load test them, if you want to optimise the data storage you test your application to make sure it is making the best use of the storage backend you have decided to use. The question is vague and does not give any examples of what you are looking for. </p>

<p>Load balancing is an entirely different subject than using dedicated servers. It is a piece of hardware/software that acts as the front end for a bunch of servers and it picks the server with the least amount of load to serve the request to the user. There are many different pieces of software out there that do load balancing, as well as hardware that will accomplish the same feat.</p>

<p>And yes, it is very cliché to think all servers look like that. A server can be your standard off the shelf hardware stuck in a standard PC case. It does not have to be a certain size, it does not have to be mounted in a rack.</p>

<p>As for your school having a very set class schedule and classes, you should consider asking them for a tour of their ""datacenter"" so you can see what their set-up looks like. You may also consider asking them for more information, and or seeing if they are open to explaining and or helping you learn what you seek to learn!</p>

<p>If you happen to have a second computer lying around, that you can run something like Linux you can start experimenting and learning. It is cheap, and won't cost you a whole lot. Personally I have multiple computers with various different OS's on them so that I can experiment.</p>

"666575","<p>I am working on fixing a website that doesn't work in the new release of IE8.  After a bit I found out that you can force IE8 to render as IE7 with the following meta tag:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!--
  Meta tag for IE8 so that it always displays the site in IE7 Compatibility mode
 --&gt;
&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=EmulateIE7&quot; /&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I have found that although the page loads fine when you specify this meta-tag; However, when you click or press the refresh button after the initial load of the page, the page renders completely wrong (see bellow):</p>

<p>This really seems like an IE8 bug to me, as I've never seen any other browser render inconstantly on a page refresh.</p>
<p>As anyone else noticed this?</p>
<br/>
<h1>Update!</h1>
<p>This was cause by having <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.my-debugbar.com%2Fwiki%2FCompanionJS%2FHomePage&amp;ei=xNzcScq0HI22NIzX4dgN&amp;usg=AFQjCNFKsEuzmMNZbkMe9UMl2OOgTVj25g"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CompanionJS</a> installed in IE8.</p>

<p>I can confirm this behaviour using IE8 on an internal site I maintain. The site was always targeted for Firefox but now they are asking me to fix up some of more glaring IE issues. At first I added the IE7 compat meta key, but kept seeing weird rendering when I refreshed the page. Thought it might be the meta key so I took that out and I still get the issue. </p>

<p>When the page is loaded fresh (enter in the address bar) everything looks great. Hit refresh and several issues crop up, including box model sizing and float/clear ordering issues.</p>

<p>I just confirmed this on another site of mine - renders perfect on first load - hit refresh and it all goes to hell.</p>

<p>The fact that I cannot find other mentions of this behaviour causes me some worry that I am doing something wrong - but my sites all work in Firefox/Chrome/Safari across windows and mac, and previously worked well enough in IE7.</p>

So the XAML initialises the ListView with a single <code>local:ImageView</code> in its <code>Items</code> collection.  But when using an ItemsControl you must use either the <code>Items</code> property or the <code>ItemsSource</code> property, you can't use both at the same time.  Hence when the ItemsSource attribute gets processed an exception is thrown.</p>
<p>You can find out which property the content of an element will get applied to by looking for the ContentPropertyAttribute on the class.  In this case it's <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.itemscontrol.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">defined</a> higher in the class hierarchy, on the ItemsControl:</p>
<pre><code>[ContentPropertyAttribute(&quot;Items&quot;)]

<p>The intention here was that the ListView's View be set to a local:ImageView so the fix is to explicitly indicate the property to be set.</p>
<p>Fix the XAML and the exception goes away:</p>

"687173","<p>I have a path made up of a list of 2D points. I want to turn these into a strip of triangles in order to render a textured line with a specified thickness (and other such things). So essentially the list of 2D points need to become a list of vertices specifying the outline of a polygon that if rendered would render the line. The problem is handling the corner joins, miters, caps etc. The resulting polygon needs to be &quot;perfect&quot; in the sense of no overdraw, clean joins, etc. so that it could feasibly be extruded or otherwise toyed with.</p>
<p>Are there any <em>simple</em> resources around that can provide algorithm insight, code or any more information on doing this efficiently?</p>
<p>I absolutely DO NOT want a full fledged 2D vector library (cairo, antigrain, OpenVG, etc.) with curves, arcs, dashes and all the bells and whistles. I've been digging in multiple source trees for OpenVG implementations and other things to find some insight, but it's all terribly convoluted.</p>
<p>I'm definitely willing to code it myself, but there are many degenerate cases (small segments + thick widths + sharp corners) that create all kinds of join issues. Even a little help would save me hours of trying to deal with them all.</p>
<p>EDIT: Here's an example of one of those degenerate cases that causes ugliness if you were simply to go from vertex to vertex. Red is the original path. The orange blocks are rectangles drawn at a specified width aligned and centered on each segment.</p>

I wasted two month on a solution that tried to solve the zero overdraw problem. As you've already found out you can't deal with all degenerated cases and have zero overdraw at the same time.</p>

<p>You can however use a hybrid approach:</p>

<p>Write yourself a routine that checks if the joins can be constructed from simple geometry without problems. To do so you have to check the join-angle, the width of the line and the length of the joined line-segments (line-segments that are shorter than their width are a PITA). With some heuristics you should be able to sort out all the trivial cases.</p>

<p>I don't know how your average line-data looks like, but in my case more than 90% of the wide lines had no degenerated cases.</p>

<p>For all other lines:</p>

<p>You've most probably already found out that if you tolerate overdraw, generating the geometry is a lot easier. Do so, and let a polygon CSG algorithm and a tesselation algorithm do the hard job. </p>

<p>I've evaluated most of the available tesselation packages, and I ended up with the GLU tesselator. It was fast, robust, never crashed (unlike most other algorithms). It was free and the license allowed me to include it in a commercial program. The quality and speed of the tesselation is okay. You will not get delaunay triangulation quality, but since you just need the triangles for rendering that's not a problem. </p>

<p>Since I disliked the tesselator API I lifted the tesselation code from the free SGI OpenGL reference implementation, rewrote the entire front-end and added memory pools to get the number of allocations down. It took two days to do this, but it was well worth it (like factor five performance improvement). The solution ended up in a commercial OpenVG implementation btw :-)</p>

<p>If you're rendering with OpenGL on a PC, you may want to move the tesselation/CSG-job from the CPU to the GPU and use stencil-buffer or z-buffer tricks to remove the overdraw. That's a lot easier and may be even faster than CPU tesselation.</p>

If this is the case, it might explain the clipping if the Notes panel is not part of the OrderList's layout calculations. Consider making the Notes control a true popup window, or else use something like an Expander which, when expanded, can tell it's parent (the UserControl) that it requires more space to render.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that containers like StackPanel will always ""stack"" their child controls (hence the name), meaning that child controls will never overlap. For this reason, setting the Z-index on any of it's childred is meaningless. I'd suggest using Grid or Canvas as containers of you want to overlap controls and then set their Z-Index. Also, remember that Z-Index is only relevant in the context of the control's immediate parent, so giving all controls Panel.Zindex=""n"" as in the above example won't work.</p>

<p>From what I can see, this problem is a layout problem, not a Z-index problem.</p>

<pre><code>public class myApplet extends Applet {
   // lots of stuff here creating your canvas, putting the image in it

<pre><code>public class MyFrame extends Frame {

"707657","<p>We are trying to come up with a numbering system for the asset system that we are creating,  there has been a few heated discussions on this topic in the office so I decided to ask the experts of SO.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong> Using auto surrogate keys.</p>

Road_Number(PK)     Segment_Number(PK)
=================   ==================
 1                   1
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong> Using program generated PK</p>

<pre><code>=================   ==================
Road_Number(PK)     Segment_Number(PK)
=================   ==================
 ""RD00000001WCK""     ""00000001.1""
</code></pre>

<p>(the <code>00000001.1</code> means it's the <strong>first</strong> segment of the road. This <em>increases</em> everytime you add a new segment e.g. <code>00000001.2</code>)</p>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong> Using a bit of both(adding a new column)</p>

<pre><code>=======================    ==========================
ID(PK) Road_Number(UK)     ID(PK)  Segment_Number(UK)
=======================    ==========================
 1     ""RD00000001WCK""       1       ""00000001.1""
</code></pre>

<p>Just a bit of background information, we will be using the <code>Road Number</code> and <code>Segment Number</code> in reports and other documents, so they have to be <strong>unique</strong>.   </p>

<p>I have always liked keeping things simple so I <em>prefer</em> example 1, but I have been reading that you should not expose your primary keys in reports/documents. So now I'm thinking more along the lines of example 3.  </p>

<p>I am also leaning towards example 3 because if we decide to change how our asset numbering is generated it won't have to do cascade updates on a primary key.</p>

<p>What do you think we should do?</p>

<p>Auto number fields are the way to go. If your keys have meaning outside your database (like asset numbers) those will quite possibly change and changing keys is problematic. Just use indexes for those things into the relevant tables.</p>

<p>When you take a look at Outlook, Calendar Event window, it has ""Save <strong>and</strong> Close"" button.</p>

<p><img src=""https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3604/3406305729_783218cae6_o.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>So when the functionalities of either or both <em>Save</em> or <em>Close</em> changes, that button should change.  It obviously violates SRP. <br /><br />
This functionality both saves time and convinient since that is what most of users <em>expect</em> to do when they save an appoint on a calendar.<br /><br /></p>

<p>But now, my question is, when <strong>else</strong> do you violate SRP other than when the feature need to be usuable in Outlook?</p>

Keep in mind that even though the button is called ""Save and Close"" there can undoubtedly be two separate methods or types to handle the saving and  closing functionality.

<p>If you feel the need to violate SRP then you need to re-evaluate your approach.  Any SRP violation can be refactored into a new method or type that exposes the composite functionality by means of composition of the two pieces.</p>

Usually, BFS doesn't keep all paths, however. Instead, it updates a prededecessor function π to save the shortest path. You can easily modify the algorithm so that <code>π(n)</code> doesn't only store <em>one</em> predecessor but a list of possible predecessors.</p>

<p>Then all possible paths are encoded in this function, and by traversing π recursively you get all possible path combinations.</p>

<p>One good pseudocode which uses this notation can be found in <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em> by Cormen <em>et al.</em> and has subsequently been used in many University scripts on the subject.

<p>I'm using dynamic images as a workaround, although that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/388677"">also has its problems</a>. I'm happy with that as a fall-back, but it seems like there should be a way to make this CSS work - it's almost there.</p>

<p>Anyone know a way to make the cells fit the content after the transform has been applied?</p>
","Rotating table header text with CSS transforms","<css><cross-browser>","2009-04-04 12:11:34","36812","717102","6","<p>‘transform’ alters the orientation of the entire element you declare it on, not the text content inside it. It's more like IE's ‘matrix’ property than ‘writing-mode’. </p>

<p>Crucially, transforming an element doesn't change how its content size is calculated (or how its parent's layout is affected by that size). CSS's algorithms for vertical and horizontal sizing are different and difficult enough to get right to being with; there's no real consistent way they could accomodate content with arbitrary rotation. So ‘transform’ is like using ‘position: relative’: it changes where the content is rendered, but not anything to do with layout size.</p>

<p>So if you want to include one in a table you'll need to set the cell's ‘height’ explicitly to accomodate the expected rotated ‘width’. If you don't know that in advance you could potentially hack it up with JavaScript, perhaps.</p>

<p>FWIW: for me on Fx3.1b3 the span is also rotated like the others. However on Windows with its horizontal-only anti-aliasing (ClearType) the rendering doesn't look great... a well-rendered image could come out considerably better.</p>

I've been designing PDA apps in Windows mobile, and I've found the best solution is to try to elminate the keyboard as much as possible.  Spend some extra time on design, implement an effective GUI with selection controls instead of textboxes.  Regardless of the virtual keyboard used, your users will likely gripe if they are required to type in too much text, as it is isn't intuitive.
I've gone as far as letting users customize responses to fields via Intranet interfaces and saving it in a DB. The user can then select ""canned"" responses from ddls and modify as necessary.</p>

"717174","<p>My question is simple. What is the best way to achieve what you see the pic below in WPF?</p>

<p>At the moment this is a horizontal StackPanel, with the right padding of the checkbox set to 90. This works okay, but if you resize the window it's no good anymore, unless maybe you re-adjust the padding in the window's resize event, but that seems clunky when using a layout manager.</p>

<p>I am coming from a Qt background, and in Qt I would use a ""stretch"" element between the buttons and the checkbox to push them apart dynamically. Is there a similar concept in WPF? If not, how do I achieve this so that it will support dynamic resizing?</p>

"724765","<p>I’m developing a Ray Tracer in C++ using SDL and Pthread. I’m having issues making my program utilize two cores. The threads work, but they don’t use both cores to 100%. To interface SDL I write directly to it's memory, SDL_Surface.pixels, so I assume that it can't be SDL locking me.</p>

<p>My thread function looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>void* renderLines(void* pArg){
while(true){
    //Synchronize
    pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;frame_mutex);
    pthread_cond_wait(&amp;frame_cond, &amp;frame_mutex);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;frame_mutex);

    renderLinesArgs* arg = (renderLinesArgs*)pArg;
    for(int y = arg-&gt;y1; y &lt; arg-&gt;y2; y++){
        for(int x = 0; x &lt; arg-&gt;width; x++){
            Color C = arg-&gt;scene-&gt;renderPixel(x, y);
            putPixel(arg-&gt;screen, x, y, C);
        }
    }

    sem_post(&amp;frame_rendered);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note: scene->renderPixel is const, so I assume both threads can read from the same memory.
I have two worker threads doing this, in my main loop I make these work using:</p>

<pre><code>//Signal a new frame
pthread_mutex_lock(&amp;frame_mutex);
pthread_cond_broadcast(&amp;frame_cond);
pthread_mutex_unlock(&amp;frame_mutex);

//Wait for workers to be done
sem_wait(&amp;frame_rendered);
sem_wait(&amp;frame_rendered);

//Unlock SDL surface and flip it...
</code></pre>

<p>Note: I've also tried creating and joining the threads instead of synchronizing them.
I compile this with ""-lpthread -D_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS -pthread"" and gcc does not complain.</p>

<p>My problem is best illustrated using a graph of the CPU usage during execution:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/DFLFg.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/DFLFg.png"" alt=""CPU usage during execution.""></a><br>
<sub>(source: <a href=""http://jopsen.dk/downloads/processor_usage.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">jopsen.dk</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>As can be seen from the graph my program only uses one core at a time, then switching between the two every once in a while, but it doesn't drive both to 100% ever.
What in the world have I done wrong? I'm not using any mutex or semaphors in scene.
What can I do to find the bug?</p>

<p>Also if I put while(true) around scene->renderPixel() I can push both cores to 100%. So I've suspected that this is caused by overhead, but I only synchronize every 0.5 second (e.g. FPS: 0.5), given a complex scene.
I realize it might not be easy to tell me what my bug is, but an approach to debugging this would be great too... I haven't played with pthreads before...</p>

<p>Also, can this be a hardware or kernel issue, my kernel is:</p>

Linux jopsen-laptop 2.6.27-14-generic #1 SMP Fri Mar 13 18:00:20 UTC 2009 i686 GNU/Linux

<p>The <a href=""http://960.gs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">960 grid system</a> says grid child nodes should follow certain rules. The first child node should have the <em>alpha</em> class and the last one the <em>omega</em> class. Which is what I'm doing above.

<blockquote>
<p>Lastly, I wanted to talk about the clearing methods included in the 960.css. First off is my personal preference, adding an innocuous bit of markup to clear all elements. I have already written about it extensively, so I won’t go over all that again. Basically, add class=&quot;clear&quot; to a &lt;span&gt; or &lt;div&gt; that you want to disappear. The only effect it will have is to clear floats.</p>
<p>The other method is for all you markup purists out there, who don’t want to dirty your HTML. Instead, you can insert markup via your CSS. This technique is well documented already as well. Essentially, add class=&quot;clearfix&quot; to elements to clear what comes after them.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: just to be clear, I am aware more-or-less how <code>vertical-align</code> works, i.e. I already know the common misconceptions.</p>

<p>From more investigation, it seems like the simplest way to fix this issue is to wrap the larger text in a <code>span</code> and set <code>vertical-align</code> on that too. The two children of <code>.categoryLinks</code> then align relative to each other. Unless someone can show a better way without extra markup?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> You've got something else going on because that works for me as is on Firefox. I even dropped the font size of SECTION: right down and it's still centered. Have you used Firebug to see what other CSS is affecting it?</p>

"733206","<p>I have several USB drives connected to a WinXP SP3 computer, and I need to tell them apart programatically - <strong>I need to find which drive letter corresponds to which device</strong> (in this case, one device ~ one volume). I can get their Volume IDs and drive letters using <code>mountvol</code>, looking something like this:</p>

<pre><code>C:\WINDOWS\&gt; mountvol

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://www.squeak.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Squeak</a> avoids terms like “left mouse
  click” because different computers,
  mice, keyboards and personal
  conﬁgurations mean that different
  users will need to press different
  physical buttons to achieve the same
  effect. Instead, the mouse buttons are
  labeled with colors. The mouse button
  that you pressed to get the “World”
  menu is called the red button; it is
  most often used for selecting items in
  lists, selecting text, and selecting
  menu items. When you start using
  Squeak, it can be surprisingly helpful
  to actually label your mouse, as shown
  in Figure 1.4.</p>

<p>As for sticking with the colors in the book, I think the reason was that the colors are still mentioned in the code, and colors don't always get mapped to the same fingers depending on the platform.

<p>The Sprite sheet only runs lengthwise, so basically each sprite section is a different action. Now would there be a way I could make a code that functions with the current one to cycle down from a set 'action' in order to make an animation?</p>

<p>If you record the frame number in a variable, you can modulo this with the number of frames you have to get an animation frame number to display.</p>

<pre><code>frame_count = 0
animation_frames = 4
while quit == False:
    # ...
    # snip
    # ...
    area = pygame.Rect(
        image_number * 100,
        (frame_count % animation_frames) * 150,
        100,
        150
    )
    display.blit(sprite, sprite_pos, area)
    pygame.display.flip()
    frame_count += 1
</code></pre>

<p>If different actions have different numbers of frames, you'll have to update animation_frames when you update image_number.</p>

<p>Also, this assumes that it's ok to play the animation starting at <em>any</em> frame. If this is not the case, you'll need to record what the frame count was when the action started, and take this away from frame count before the modulo:</p>

<pre><code>    area = pygame.Rect(
        image_number * 100,
        ((frame_count - action_start_frame) % animation_frames) * 150,
        100,
        150
    )
</code></pre>

<p>A note about your event handling. If you hold down, say, left, and tap right but keep holding down left, the sprite stops moving because the last event you processed was a keyup event, despite the fact that I'm still holding left.</p>

<p>If this is not what you want, you can get around it by either keeping a record of the up/down states of the keys you are interested in, or by using the <a href=""http://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html#pygame.key.get_pressed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pygame.key.get_pressed</a> interface.</p>

<p>On another note, you appear to be aiming for a fixed frame rate, and at the same time determining how far to move your sprite based on the time taken in the last frame. In my opinion, this probably isn't ideal.</p>

<p>2D action games generally need to work in a predictable manner. If some CPU heavy process starts in the background on your computer and causes your game to no longer be able to churn out 60 frames a second, it's probably preferable for it to slow down, rather then have your objects start skipping huge distances between frames. Imagine if this happened in a 2D action game like Metal Slug where you're having to jump around avoiding bullets?</p>

<p>This also makes any physics calculations much simpler. You'll have to make a judgement call based on what type of game it is.</p>

"739867","<p>I’m on the learning curve up the Silverlight trail.  I’m a data-centric developer so I naturally picked up the ADO.NET Data Services client along the way.  I’m scratching my head over a real-world scenario and can’t seem to find any help in documentation, blogs etc.</p>

<p>I’ve got a complex Tutor entity with related entity sets for Addresses, PhoneNumbers, and EmailAddresses.  I’ve also got a couple other sets like Subjects and Certifications.  Along with all this come foreign keys to lookup tables for things like StatusCodes, AddressTypes (like Home, Business etc), EmailTypes and so on.   All this is encapsulated in an edmx in my Model project.  Here’s a portion of the structure.  </p>

<p><img src=""https://pqgd7w.bay.livefilestore.com/y1msuZUam9y4h52ek7DvFQt_MDGXSdxpncm5jffDz-wYaVanAL9cF5m8x3pXLn57DZkDQOBjMN6eC07FJglepwj7IzoD1LGpxp_bqKZ2lv5xpQXCCYzAyt3jK3EzBZwnpyJKGY9-AmByWubry6gYSrTiQ/image[4].png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>In Silverlight I’ve got a UserControl that is a data entry form for this tutor.  I’ve created a DTO like object for the data binding to the client’s TextBox controls.  All’s well till the user clicks Save.  </p>

<p>The Save routine creates and adds a Tutor and Person objects and adds them to the DataServiceContext and links them properly.  Where I’m running into trouble is that I have to add a related entity that’s ALREADY stored in the context on the database such as code tables.  </p>

<p>For example, the person may have multiple Subject specialties:  Elementary Math, Elementary Science etc.  The TutorSubjectSet has to relate to 3 other sets: Subject (e.g.. Math), SubjectLevel (e.g.. Elementary) and then to the Tutor.  My DTO has a list of combined Subject_With_Level items that presents a sub-set of a true Cartesian selection (there’s no such thing as Elementary (school) Calculus at least not where I went to school :-).  That list shows up as a checkbox list on the UI.  So, when the user clicks Save I pick up the checked items and I try to do a lookup on the combined Subject_With_Level.SubjectId and .SubjectLevelId values against the code tables that have those values.  </p>

<p>This is where I’m lost.  In a server-side function, I’d be OK because I can do those lookups in-line and get the entity immediately.  In an Async situation, how do I get the related entities while I’m busy assembling the person graph?  Doing an Async call in the middle of the Save process doesn’t work.</p>

<p>I’ve tried various things:  I tried making an ad-hoc replica of the SubjectLevel using the Subject_With_Level.SubjectLevelId and attaching that to the context as follows:</p>

<pre>
<code>


public static SubjectLevel MakeFakeSubjectLevelFor(TutoringEntities ctx, Subject_With_Level subjectAndLevel)
{
     var subjectLevel = new SubjectLevel()
                       {
                         SubjectLevelId = subjectAndLevel.SubjectLevelId,
                         Description = subjectAndLevel.SubjectLevel,
                         EffectiveDate = DateTime.Now,
                         EnteredBy = """",
                         EnteredDate = DateTime.Now,
                         Type = subjectAndLevel.SubjectLevel
                       }; 
    try { ctx.AttachTo(""SubjectLevelSet"", subjectLevel); }
    catch { //this tries to catch situations where the level (eg. Elementary) has already been created }
    return subjectLevel; 
} 


</code>
</pre>

<p>This approach works for situations where there are no duplicates (it also has the advantage that I don’t have to do an additional call.)  For example in Addresses, there will be only one Home address (I have a similar function: MakeAFakeAddressTypeFor()).  You’ll notice I have a try/catch that catches the error if the items is already inserted into the SubjectLevelSet. If the item has already been inserted and I hit that error, the returned subjectLevel is not attached to the context.  I get an error since the item is not being tracked.  However, I can’t retrieve an existing subjectLevel without issuing an Async query against the SubjectLevelSet even if it’s in my local context.</p>

<p>What I'd like to do is:</p>

<pre><code>
var lev = ctx.SubjectLevelSet.Where(l => l.SubjectLevelId == subjectAndLevel.SubjectLevelId).FirstOrDefault();
if(lev == null )
  lev = Helpers.MakeFakeSubjectLevelFor(ctx, subjectAndLevel);
</code></pre>

<p>but I get: ""Specified method is not supported"" which I assume means I have to do the query Async so I'm back to the same situation.</p>

<p>I’ve also tried to retrieve a list of SubjectLevels in the Loaded event delegate.  That way I’d have the set of SubjectElements on hand when the Save button is pushed.  Same problem, I have to issue an Async call to do a search even if I’ve got it in-hand.  I tried iterating through the list for the one I needed but that gave me an error saying that the entity was not being tracked by the context.</p>

<p>So… clearly I’m not understanding this and am doing it wrong but I can’t find any practical examples that do this kind of thing.  The how-to examples just happily load primitives into the entity to be stored.  No examples that I’ve seen show related entities and how to retrieve them.

Is that assumption correct? If that is the case, you should examine what you are trying to do with the query itself. I always find that if I can write the SQL to get exactly the data I want then I can move forward with writing the LINQ to it (using something like LINQPad).</p>

<p>Additionally, you can also make a SQL view which ""flattens"" your complex graph. Then in EF update wizard make sure you select the view. That way everytime you are building this custom complex DTO you can just issue a server side where clause instead and populate your values there. </p>

"741293","<p>I'm attempting to make a TinyURL clone in ASP.NET MVC as a learning project.</p>

<p>Right now, all I want is to be able to submit new URLs to my /Home/Create action via a form.</p>

<p><img src=""https://imgur.com/JJOP0.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I have my LINQ expression all setup, I have my routing setup, and I have my view setup but something is wrong with my setup.  </p>

<p>Routing:</p>

<pre><code> routes.MapRoute(
            ""Default"",                                              // Route name
            """",                           // URL with parameters
            new { controller = ""Home"", action = ""Index"" }  // Parameter defaults
        );

 routes.MapRoute(
            ""Redirect"",
            ""{hash}"",
            new { controller = ""Home"", action = ""RequestLink"", hash = """" }
        );
</code></pre>

<p>These routes allow me to be able to go to my website, www.tinyurlclone.com/ and if nothing is passed ti will simply go to my Home/Index() action.  However, if you put anything after the slash, it will consider that a Link Hash and attempt to retrieve the hash.</p>

<p>My HomeController is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>[HandleError]  
public class HomeController : Controller  
{  
    TinyGetRepository repo = new TinyGetRepository();

    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        return View();
    }


    public ActionResult Create(String url)
    {
        String hash = repo.addLink(url);
        ViewData[""LinkHash""] = hash;
        return View();
    }

    public ActionResult RequestLink(String hash)
    {
        String url = repo.getLink(hash);
        return Redirect(url);

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>My repo class has all my LINQ expressions in it for dealing with the database and I don't really need to include them because it isn't relevant to this question.</p>

<p>Finally, my basic Home/Index() view (used for submitting urls) is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Page Language=""C#"" Inherits=""System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage"" %&gt;

&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""&gt;

&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"" &gt;
&lt;head runat=""server""&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Index&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;center&gt;
            &lt;span style=""font-size: 14pt""&gt;TinyGet &lt;em&gt;(beta)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;span style=""font-family: Tahoma""&gt;Reduce your long links to smaller ones to keep them more memorable....&lt;br /&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;% using(Html.BeginForm(""Create"", ""Home"")) %&gt;
            &lt;% { %&gt;
            &lt;%= Html.TextBox(""url"") %&gt;
            &lt;input type=""submit"" name=""submitButton"" value=""Shorten Link!"" /&gt;
            &lt;% } %&gt;

      &lt;/center&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, my form simply isn't firing any methods when I click submit.</p>

<p>Furthermore, if I view the source of my generated HTML I can see that it didn't make my Form's action correctly, it reads:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action="""" method=""post""&gt;&lt;input id=""url"" name=""url"" type=""text"" value="""" /&gt;
            &lt;input type=""submit"" name=""submitButton"" value=""Shorten Link!"" /&gt;
            &lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Why is the HTML helper putting """" as the action when it ~should~ be putting /Home/Create?  Why isn't my /Home/Create action method being called?  Even if I don't use the Html helpers and specify the <code>&lt;form</code>> tag manually it throws errors.</p>

<p>What is wrong here?</p>

","Why doesn't this form call my controller action in ASP.NET MVC?","<asp.net-mvc><webforms>","2009-04-12 05:10:11","2596","741454","2","<p>The problem is that you don't have a route that matches the route values (controller = Home, action = Create).</p>

<p>You have two routes, one is the empty string (no parameters), which matches Controller = ""Home"", Action = ""Index"".  The other is your hash route, which matches Controller = ""Home"", Action = ""RequestLink"".  So, when ASP.Net Routing goes to build a URL from the route values you're providing, it can't find one (since none of them have the ""{controller}"" and ""{action}"" parameters).</p>

<p>The simplest solution, in this case, is to create a direct route to the ""Create"" action, so that you can still use your ""hash"" route.  Put this at the top of your RegisterRoutes method. NOTE: Order <em>does</em> matter! ASP.Net Routing checks each route, in the order added, until it finds a match.</p>

<pre><code>routes.MapRoute(
        ""Create"",                                              // Route name
        ""Create"",                           // URL with parameters
        new { controller = ""Home"", action = ""Create"" }  // Parameter defaults
    );
</code></pre>

<p>Since you have that ""hash"" route, you can't really use the default ""{controller}/{action}/{id}"" technique, since the ""hash"" value would be consider a valid Controller name. So, if someone requested: <a href=""http://www.mysite.com/fjhas82"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.mysite.com/fjhas82</a>, MVC would look for a Controller called ""fjhas82"" and complain that it couldn't find it.  Unfortunately, this means you have to manually add new routes for each new Controller Action (like I showed above), which is a pain. </p>

<p>The best solution (in my opinion) is to use Regex Constraints: If your hashes have a very well-defined format (say: 5 letters followed by 2 numbers, or ""_"" followed by any alpha-numeric characters, etc.), or if you're willing to impose such a format, you can use the Regex constraints supported by ASP.Net Routing.  Then, you'd only need these two routes</p>

<pre><code>routes.MapRoute(
        ""Redirect"",
        ""{hash}"",
        new { controller = ""Home"", action = ""RequestLink"" },
        new { hash = @""[a-zA-Z]{5}[0-9]{2}"" } // Regex Constraints
    );

routes.MapRoute(
    ""Default"",                                              // Route name
    ""{controller}/{action}/{id}"",                           // URL with parameters
    new { controller = ""Home"", action = ""Index"" }  // Parameter defaults
);    
</code></pre>

<p>Under these routes, if MVC sees a controller name like: ""Home"", it will check the first route, find that it doesn't match the regular expression, and move to the next one.  NOTE: My Regular Expression syntax may be a bit rusty, so I'd use something like <a href=""http://regexpal.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://regexpal.com/</a> to test a Regex first, to make sure it works with your hashes and controller names.</p>

<p>Hope that helps, I know I wrote a lot, but MVC is so flexible, you can do things in so many different ways!</p>

"746082","<p>Lately I have been playing a game on my iPhone called Scramble. Some of you may know this game as Boggle. Essentially, when the game starts you get a matrix of letters like so:</p>
<pre><code>F X I E
A M L O
E W B X
A S T U
</code></pre>
<p>The goal of the game is to find as many words as you can that can be formed by chaining letters together. You can start with any letter, and all the letters that surround it are fair game, and then once you move on to the next letter, all the letters that surround that letter are fair game, <strong>except for any previously used letters</strong>. So in the grid above, for example, I could come up with the words <code>LOB</code>, <code>TUX</code>, <code>SEA</code>, <code>FAME</code>, etc. Words must be at least 3 characters, and no more than NxN characters, which would be 16 in this game but can vary in some implementations.  While this game is fun and addictive, I am apparently not very good at it and I wanted to cheat a little bit by making a program that would give me the best possible words (the longer the word the more points you get).</p>

This is why your polygons are blended with the background. You can confirm that this is indeed the problem by disabling the depth test. Without depth test all the fragments are displayed and you'll be able to see the alpha blending.</p>

"753140","<p>Suppose there are a number of convex polygons on a plane, perhaps a map.  These polygons can bump up against each other and share an edge, but cannot overlap.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/AkGPs.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>To test if two polygons <strong>P</strong> and <strong>Q</strong> overlap, first I can test each edge in <strong>P</strong> to see if it intersects with any of the edges in <strong>Q</strong>.  If an intersection is found, I declare that <strong>P</strong> and <strong>Q</strong> intersect.  If none intersect, I then have to test for the case that <strong>P</strong> is completely contained by <strong>Q</strong>, and vice versa.  Next, there's the case that <strong>P</strong>==<strong>Q</strong>.  Finally, there's the case that share a few edges, but not all of them.  (These last two cases can probably be thought of as the same general case, but that might not be important.)</p>

<p>I have an algorithm that detects where two line segments intersect.  If the two segments are co-linear, they are not considered to intersect for my purposes.</p>

<p>Have I properly enumerated the cases?  Any suggestions for testing for these cases?</p>

<p>Note that I'm not looking to find the new convex polygon that is the intersection, I just want to know if an intersection exists.  There are many well documented algorithms for finding the intersection, but I don't need to go through all the effort.</p>
","How do I determine if two convex polygons intersect?","<geometry><polygon><convex>","2009-04-15 18:49:42","55979","753214","7","<p>You could use <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20141127210836/http://content.gpwiki.org/index.php/Polygon_Collision"" rel=""noreferrer"">this collision algorithm</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be able to decide whether two convex polygons are intersecting (touching each other) we can use the Separating Axis Theorem. Essentially:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>If two convex polygons are not intersecting, there exists a line that passes between them.</li>
  <li>Such a line only exists if one of the sides of one of the polygons forms such a line.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The first statement is easy. Since the polygons are both convex, you'll be able to draw a line with one polygon on one side and the other polygon on the other side unless they are intersecting. The second is slightly less intuitive. Look at figure 1. Unless the closest sided of the polygons are parallel to each other, the point where they get closest to each other is the point where a corner of one polygon gets closest to a side of the other polygon. This side will then form a separating axis between the polygons. If the sides are parallel, they both are separating axes.</p>
  
  <p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/8YZ54.png"" alt=""""></p>
  
  <p>So how does this concretely help us decide whether polygon A and B intersect? Well, we just go over each side of each polygon and check whether it forms a separating axis. To do this we'll be using some basic vector math to squash all the points of both polygons onto a line that is perpendicular to the potential separating line (see figure 2). Now the whole problem is conveniently 1-dimensional. We can determine a region in which the points for each polygon lie, and this line is a separating axis if these regions do not overlap.</p>
  
  <p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/CNeSx.png"" alt=""""></p>
  
  <p>If, after checking each line from both polygons, no separating axis was found, it has been proven that the polygons intersect and something has to be done about it.</p>

"755944","<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> After re-reading my post I think I am being a little bit unclear about what the problem is. Let me try to re-phrase it:</p>
<p>Users can leave comments on my site using a textarea field in a form. It should be possible to add line breaks in the comment using <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>. The comment is then stored as a string in a mysql-database (escaped to make it safe) and later on retrieved from the database and displayed on the site. Regular line breaks are not recognized when the comment is displayed.</p>
<p>Users can edit their comments, and in that case the original comment is displayed in a textarea field to be modified (see image below). The problem is that if there are any <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> present, the code is not valid as XHTML 1.0 (see error message below).</p>
<p>Can I make the code valid using any other type of line break? As stated in the comments, regular line breaks in combination with xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot; does not work (line breaks are displayed in the textarea field, but not when the comment is displayed as normal text on the site).</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Original question:</strong></p>
<p>I have a web-form which includes a textarea field to leave comments, and I want it to be able to add line breaks using <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code>. Below is a simple example:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/ymdjW.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ymdjW.png"" alt=""screen dump"" /></a><br />
<sub>(source: <a href=""http://www.shipit.se/dump/textarea-dump.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">shipit.se</a>)</sub></p>
<p>It works as intended, however it does not validate as XHTML 1.0 transitional when using the W3C validation service. This is the error I get:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Error  Line 90, Column 1587: document type does not allow element &quot;br&quot; here</li>
</ol>
<p><code>…ription&quot; rows=&quot;0&quot; cols=&quot;0&quot;&gt;Test&lt;br /&gt;line break&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;/dd&gt;&lt;dt class=&quot;cha</code></p>
<p>The element named above was found in a context where it is not allowed. This could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements -- such as a &quot;style&quot; element in the &quot;body&quot; section instead of inside &quot;head&quot; -- or two elements that overlap (which is not allowed).</p>
<p>One common cause for this error is the use of XHTML syntax in HTML documents. Due to HTML's rules of implicitly closed elements, this error can create cascading effects. For instance, using XHTML's &quot;self-closing&quot; tags for &quot;meta&quot; and &quot;link&quot; in the &quot;head&quot; section of a HTML document may cause the parser to infer the end of the &quot;head&quot; section and the beginning of the &quot;body&quot; section (where &quot;link&quot; and &quot;meta&quot; are not allowed; hence the reported error).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there a way to make the line breaks valid code, or do I need to find a workaround (like e.g. using specific tags for line breaks in the textarea field and then replacing them with <code>&lt;br /&gt;</code> later on when displaying the comment)?</p>

<p>In the XHTML code of your page, a <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code> can only contain text (<code>#PCDATA</code>), and you cannot nest any XHTML elements within the <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>In the first case, having ""<code>Test&lt;br /&gt;line break</code>"" appear to the user in the text area is done by using the appropriate entities, just as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/755944/possible-to-add-line-breaks-in-a-textarea-field-while-keeping-it-xhtml-1-0-valid/755996#755996"">altCognito</a> wrote:</p>

That washed out dotty image should be semitransparent. The black bits are supposed to be completely transparent. As you can see, there's an image behind it that isn't showing through.</p>

<p>The code to generate that texture is rather lengthy, so I'll describe what I did. It's a 40*30*4 array of type unsigned char. Every 4th char is set to 128 (should be 50% transparent, right?).</p>

<p>I then pass it into this function, loads the data into a texture:</p>

<pre><code>void Texture::Load(unsigned char* data, GLenum format) {
    glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
        glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, _texID);
        glTexSubImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, 0, 0, _w, _h, format, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, data);
    glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And...I think I just found the problem.  Was initializing the full-sized texture with this code:</p>

<pre><code>glEnable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, _texID);
    glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGB, tw, th, 0, GL_LUMINANCE, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, NULL);
    glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
    glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
    glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_NEAREST);
    glTexParameterf(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_NEAREST);
    glTexEnvf(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL_REPLACE);
glDisable(GL_TEXTURE_2D);
</code></pre>

<p>But I guess glTexImage2D needs to be GL_RGBA too? I can't use two different internal formats? Or at least not ones of different sizes (3 bytes vs 4 bytes)? GL_BGR works fine even when its initialized like this...</p>

<p><b>Update</b></p>

<p>In the wiki spirit of StackOverflow, here's an update: </p>

<p>I spiked Joe White's IValueConverter suggestion below. It works like a charm. </p>

<p>I've written a ""quickstart"" example of this that automates the mapping of ViewModels->Views using some cheap string replacement. If no View is found to represent the ViewModel, it defaults to an ""Under Construction"" page. I'm dubbing this approach ""WPF MVVM White"" since it was Joe White's idea. Here are a couple screenshots.</p>

<p>The first image is a case of ""[SomeControlName]ViewModel"" has a corresponding ""[SomeControlName]View"", based on <b>pure naming convention</b>. The second is a case where the ModelView doesn't have any views to represent it. No more ResourceDictionaries with long ViewModel to View mappings. It's pure naming convention now.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/vnZOm.jpg"" alt=""Wpf Mvvm White""></p>

<p><b>Original Post</b></p>

<p>I read Josh Smith's <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fantastic MSDN article</a> on WPF MVVM over the weekend. It's destined to be a cult classic.</p>

<p>It took me a while to wrap my head around the magic of asking WPF to render the <b>ViewModel</b>. </p>

<p>It's like saying ""Here's a class, WPF. Go figure out which UI to use to present it.""</p>

<p>For those who missed this magic, WPF can do this by looking up the <b>View</b> for <b>ModelView</b> in the ResourceDictionary mapping and pulling out the corresponding <b>View</b>.  (Scroll down to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd419663.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Figure 10 Supplying a View </a>). </p>

<p>The first thing that jumps out at me immediately is that there's already a strong naming convention of:</p>

<pre><code>classNameView  (""View"" suffix)
classNameViewModel (""ViewModel"" suffix)
</code></pre>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p>Since the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.resourcedictionary.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ResourceDictionary</a> can be manipulated programatically, I""m wondering if anyone has managed to Regex.Replace the whole thing away, <b>so the lookup is automatic</b>, and any new View/ViewModels get resolved by virtue of their naming convention?</p>

<p>[Edit] What I'm imagining is a hook/interception into ResourceDictionary. </p>

<p>... Also considering a method at startup that uses interop to pull out <code>*View$</code> and <code>*ViewModel$</code> class names to build the DataTemplate dictionary in code:</p>

<pre><code>//build list
foreach ....
    String.Format(""&lt;DataTemplate DataType=\""{x:Type vm:{0} }\""&gt;&lt;v:{1} /&gt;&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;"", ...)
</code></pre>
","WPF MVVM: Convention over Configuration for ResourceDictionary?","<wpf><mvvm>","2009-04-20 13:40:26","5165","789315","2","<p>Rather than writing code to explicitly add things to the ResourceDictionary, how about just generating the right view on demand? You can do this with a ValueConverter.</p>

<p>Your resources would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Views:ConventionOverConfigurationConverter x:Key=""MyConverter""/&gt;
&lt;DataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type ViewModels:ViewModelBase}""&gt;
    &lt;ContentControl Content=""{Binding Converter={StaticResource MyConverter}}""/&gt;
&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You still need a DataTemplate resource, but as long as your ViewModels all have a common base class, you'll only need one DataTemplate to take care of all of them.</p>

<p>Then define the value converter class:</p>

<pre><code>public class ConventionOverConfigurationConverter : IValueConverter
{
    public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter,
        CultureInfo culture)
    {
        // value is the ViewModel. Based on its GetType(), build a string
        // with the namespace-qualified name of the view class, then:
        return Activator.CreateInstance(Type.GetType(viewName));
    }
    public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType,
        object parameter, CultureInfo culture)
    {
        throw new NotSupportedException();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>All you'd need to do is write the logic inside Convert, which will depend on things like whether your Views and ViewModels are in the same namespace or not.</p>

<p>Examples in C, C#, and Python. </p>

<p>Debain also has a <a href=""http://www.debian-administration.org/article/Creating_desktop_notifications"" rel=""noreferrer"">tutorial</a> that should more or less have some commonality. </p>

<p>Basically your going to be tying into the NotifyOSD framework which leverages the Free Desktop Foundations <a href=""http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus"" rel=""noreferrer"">D-Bus</a> messaging system. </p>

<p>For development you'll need <a href=""https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libnotify/"" rel=""noreferrer"">libnotify</a> ( <a href=""http://www.galago-project.org/docs/api/libnotify/files.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">only online documentation I could find</a> )</p>

<p>If you just want some quick results from the command line or to use in a shell script you can also use the <strong>notify-send</strong> command. </p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<pre><code>notify-send [OPTION...] &lt;SUMMARY&gt; [BODY] 
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>notify-send Test ""Totally gnarly message bro""
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can specify an icon:</p>

<pre><code>notify-send -i ../icon.jpg  Image ""This is a sweet picture""
</code></pre>

<p>There are a bunch of other options, expire time, urgency level, category. </p>

<p>Ubuntu doesn't follow the Notification specification that closely, they don't honor alot of the options defined by the FSF. Don't be surprised if some things don't work with ubuntu's notifier that you see working with another notifier system. </p>

<p>I'll try and explain the problem without diagrams 1st.</p>

<p>3D renderers work by drawing the polygons from back to front. It does this by assigning each polygon to one of a discrete number of positions. This works for most scenes.</p>

<p>You get a problem when there aren't enough slots to be able to decide which polygon is in front of another.</p>

<p>To solve it - it will depend on your application, but there are a number of things which should be common to all:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure the bounding box of the world is as small as possible.</li>
<li>Increase the colour depth of your display. Both OpenGL and Direct3D can tie the number of z slots to the resolution of the display.</li>
<li>Increase the number/decrease the size of your triangles. Smaller triangles are going to be less affected by this - but will decrease the performance as there are more to draw.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are running on Windows you should set the desktop to the highest colour resolution. You application might pick that up as the default to use.</p>

<p>Can you switch between OpenGL and Direct3D rendering? If so then try both, one might give better results than the other.</p>

<p>I have a class with a static method, <code>GetProperty&lt;T&gt;</code> that returns a property value lazily.</p>

<pre><code>private static T GetProperty&lt;T&gt;(T backingField, Func&lt;T&gt; factory) 
    where T : class 
{
    if (backingField == null)
        backingField = factory();
    return backingField;
}

<p>But when I use above method to return a property, 
I am getting two warnings that says that private backing fields are not assigned.
But they are assigned later on only when they are needed.</p>

"792891","<p>I'm not sure exactly what went wrong here, but ReSharper 4.5 RTM seems to have stolen my Visual Studio colour theme. I normally use <a href=""http://www.frickinsweet.com/tools/Theme.mvc.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Fredrik Kalseth's wicked theme</a>, and I've been using ReSharper since version 2.0. Never before has this happened - not even while using the 4.5 Beta. My scheme remained intact without detrimental interference - well, actually ReSharper did its normal highlighting which was actually quite complimentary! But this time, when building my new machine, the outcome looks like this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/gjf8i.jpg"" alt=""Dark colours meant for a light theme""></p>

<p>Yes I know that ReShaper colours can be configured under Tools->Font and Colors, but firstly, I don't want to have to do that, and secondly, I want to understand why this has happened only now, and never before.</p>

<p>When I uninstall ReSharper, the colours go back to normal. I have tried removing the theme and resharper and reinstalling in different orders to no avail. I apply the theme with a code file open, and see a brief flash of the correct colours how they used to look, and then ReSharper takes over.</p>

<p>I've tried <a href=""http://www.frickinsweet.com/tools/Theme.mvc.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ryan and Joel's AWESOME theme generator</a>, but I see the same brief flash of the correct colours being applied after importing, and then the crappy colours overlay themselves again. I say they are crappy only in the context of a dark theme, on a light theme they look just fine.</p>

<p>I just want to know how to have my cake and eat it like it's been all this time. I must stress, that the theme and resharper have been working hand in hand perfectly together all the time I've used it (6 months at least), it's only happened on my new machine - my old machine looks and works fine. Oh - and I have a fully licensed version of ReSharper - not a trial.</p>

<p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>[UPDATE]</strong>
From provided answers so far, as long as I do not set an IDisposable argument to null, I can simply pass an object by value without using <code>ref</code>.
I am now having another trouble whether to set disposable objects to <code>null</code> or not within <code>DisposeObject</code> method.  <br /></p>

<p>Here is the full source for completeness:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo : IDisposable

    private Bar _Bar;
    private Baz _Baz;
    private bool _IsDisposed;

    ~Foo() { Dispose(false); }

    public void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!_IsDisposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                DisposeObject(ref _Baz);
                DisposeObject(ref _Bar);

            obj = null;
        } catch (ObjectDisposedException) { /* Already Disposed... */ }

    public void Dispose() {}

public class Baz : IDisposable

    public void Dispose() {}

<p><strong>[RESULT]</strong> <br />
I removed the code that sets argument to null (<code>obj = null;</code>) within <code>DisposeObject</code>
So the final code became.</p>

<pre><code>    public void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!_IsDisposed)

            if (disposing)

                DisposeObject(_Bar);

        _IsDisposed = true;

","Passing an IDisposable object by reference causes an error?","<c#><dispose><idisposable><pass-by-reference>","2009-04-27 15:47:24","4448","794154","5","<p>There is no need for you to pass by reference, as you're passing a reference type. You should remove the <code>ref</code> keyword from your method definition. Do this and you shouldn't have any issues, though I'm not sure how this is more effective or clearer than simply calling <code>Dispose()</code> (other than the fact that you don't have to cast it for explicit implementations and this does a <code>null</code> check for you).</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Dance, while I hope the discussion that's surrounded this topic has been helpful to you, your original intent doesn't seem to be something that's doable. In order to pass something as <code>ref</code>, you can't pass a variable that has a type other than what the <code>ref</code> parameter expects (in other words, you can't pass a variable declared as a <code>class</code> or other <code>interface</code> that implements <code>IDisposable</code> if the <code>ref</code> parameter is <code>IDisposable</code>). Because <code>ref</code> parameters allow assignments to propagate back to the caller, you would open up the possibility of allowing incompatible types being stored in your variable.</p>

<p>Your best bet here is to assign <code>null</code> yourself if that's what you want. If you want to encapsulate the <code>null</code> check and ignoring exceptions in to the function that's fine, but <code>ref</code> will not work for you in this scenario no matter how you slice it, unfortunately.</p>

Printing Binary Trees in Ascii

Here we are not going to discuss what binary trees are (please refer this, if you are looking for binary search trees), or their operations but printing them in ascii.

The below routine prints tree in ascii for a given Tree representation which contains list of nodes, and node structure is this

    struct Tree 
    {
      Tree * left, * right;
      int element;
    };

<p>I'm running into some transparency artifacts (purple bar is actually purple under the green, and sometimes it draws over the top, etc) and it just seems a bit wasteful.  So, I decided to make my own, but now I've got a bit of paralysis on how to do it.  Do I use the DrawingContext in FrameworkElement's OnRender, or is there something simpler?  Is there a set of general rules when it comes to making your own control?</p>

<p>I pondered switching to a pie chart since those are easy to come by, but its high time I did something not off-the-shelf.</p>

<p>1) I would probably create a user control for this new progresbar.</p>

<p>2) It would have a property called NumberOfProgresses, that is tied with an array containing status of said progresses.</p>

<p>3) Each progress would be represented by a Border item (or perhaps something more suitable up the visual tree), because it's a simple wpf control with a background property. The background property would be set to nice a looking progress style and the progress color can be bound in the style to say the border's borderbrush property. Making it easy to set the color of the progress.</p>

<p>4) The user control would have a method UpdateProgress which takes the percentage value and the index of the progress in the array as parameters.</p>

<p>5) As progresses are updated you can either, just calculate the appropriate width (user control actual width * percentage) for the border and play around with the Z index to get it displayed at the top/bottom, or stack the borders horizontaly, set the least along progress as first, then for the rest of the progresses you'd have to substract previous progresses lengths to get the same effect.</p>

<p>This way there would be no transparency induced artifacts and no OnRender()...
Mind you, in WPF there should be no reason to mess with OnRender this and OnRender that, like it was required in WinForms with OnPaint.
Just set up the elements via code to get the look you want, and let WPF do it's rendering ;) </p>

<p>I can imagine one problem with this user control though. You'd have to provide feedback to the user as to which color belongs to which progress. But that would probably take you back to square one, meaning it's better/simpler to just display multiple progressbars.</p>

As you spotted, the metadata did change, but not in a way that the managed incremental build feature considers signifcant.  However, if you force a recompile of one of the cpp files, it grabs the new metadata, embeds it in the obj, and then the linker sees a conflict.</p>

<p>There are two ways to resolve this problem. A simple way that seems to work, from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/810827/lnk2022-metadata-operation-failed-driving-me-insane/1091175#1091175"">demoncodemonkey's answer below</a> is to specify an explicit version number in the referenced assembly metadata to instruct the compiler that the referenced assembly is in fact at the same version:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Replace</p>

<pre><code>[assembly:AssemblyVersionAttribute(""1.0.*"")];
</code></pre>
  
  <p>with</p>

<pre><code>[assembly:AssemblyVersionAttribute(""1.0.0.1"")];

  <p>in <code>AssemblyInfo.cpp.</code> This will ensure that the version does not
  change between incremental builds.</p>

<p>The alternative way to avoid this problem is by disabling the feature.  We may recompile some cpp files unnecessarily, but it's better than having the linker fail.</p>

<p>About halfway down this image, there's a line with a long comment that forces the enclosing <code>div</code> to provide a horizontal scrollbar (via the <code>overflow: auto</code> setting.) As shown in the screenshot, the surrounding lines with gray backgrounds don't stretch to fill the entire width of the parent's canvas. Instead, they remain fixed at the width of the parent's <strong>viewport</strong>. (Those backgrounds belong to <code>div</code>s that enclose individual lines of text.)</p>

<p>I see this in Firefox 3.1 and IE8 (regardless of IE7 compatibility mode.)</p>

<p>Is there any cross-browser method to force those child <code>div</code>s to stretch to the full width of the canvas (or put another way, to set their widths to the max width of their peers)? My guess is ""no"", or the site's author would be using it.</p>

"818336","<p>I have a question related to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/481136/linq-to-sql-object-child-properties-in-gridview"">this one</a>. I don't want to do a calculation (aggregation), but I need to get display values from an association. In my C# code, I can directly reference the value, because the foreign key constraint made Linq generate all the necessary wiring.
When I specify the IQueryable as the Gridview datasource property, and reference something that is not a column of the primary entity in the result set, I get an error that the column does not exist.
As a newbie to Linq, I am guessing the assignment implicitely converts the IQueryable to a list, and the associations are lost.
My question is, what is a good way to do this?</p>

<p>I assume that I can work around this by writing a parallel query returning an anonymous type that contains all the columns that I need for the gridview. It seems that by doing that I would hold data in memory redundantly that I already have. Can I query the in-memory data structures on the fly when assigning the data source? Or is there a more direct solution?</p>

<p>The gridview is supposed to display the physician's medical group associations, and the name of the association is in a lookup table.</p>

<pre><code>            IQueryable&lt;Physician&gt; ph =
                        from phys   in db.Physicians
                        //from name   in phys.PhysicianNames.DefaultIfEmpty()
                        //from lic    in phys.PhysicianLicenseNums.DefaultIfEmpty()
                        //from addr   in phys.PhysicianAddresses.DefaultIfEmpty()
                        //from npi    in phys.PhysicianNPIs.DefaultIfEmpty() 
                        //from assoc  in phys.PhysicianMedGroups.DefaultIfEmpty()
                        where phys.BQID == bqid
                        select phys;

<p>So, based on Denis' answer, I removed all the unneeded stuff from my query. I figured that I may not be asking the right question to begin with.</p>

<p>Anyways, the page shows a physician's data. I want to display all medical group affiliations in a grid (and let the user insert, edit, and update affiliations). I now realize that I don't need to explicitly join in these other tables - Linq does that for me. I can access the license number, which is in a separate table, by referencing it through the chain of child associations.
I cannot reference the medical group name in the gridview, which brings me back to my question:</p>

<pre><code>AffiliationGrid.DataSource = ph.First().PhysicianMedGroups;
</code></pre>

<p>This does not work, because med_group_print_name is not accessible for the GridView:</p>

<pre><code>A field or property with the name 'med_group_print_name' was not found on the
selected data source.
</code></pre>

<p>Again, bear with me, if it is all too obvious that I don't understand Linq ... because I don't.</p>

<pre><code>ph = from phys in db.Physicians
     where phys.BQID == bqid
     select phys;
</code></pre>

<p>in your grid. That should work.
Also, why the calls to Load()? If the DataContext is not disposed when the grid is binding, you should not need it.</p>

<p>If you still have issues, can you please post the error message you get, that would help...</p>

<p>Part 2</p>

<p>The problem is that you have the name is effectively not in the PhysMedGroup. You need to navigate one level down to the MedGroupLookup to access the name, since it is a property of that class.</p>

<p>Depending on the technology you are using (it seems to be either WinForms or Web Forms), you will need to configure your data-binding to access MedGroupLookup.med_group_print_name.</p>

"819990","<p>I have a WPF application (.NET 3.0, VS2008) that displays data in a tab control. Custom colors are required on virtually all controls in this application : basically white foreground and green background.</p>

<p>My problem is that when an XP theme (say Luna) is active, it is automatically applied to render controls so that my white text is written on ... a white background. For instance on the active tab item header : <img src=""https://lh6.ggpht.com/_dR4_IBKyRV0/Sf7kTth9ZaI/AAAAAAAAAD8/sUrspncvXek/s800/Sigp3d-WPF-Luna.png"" alt=""Unreadable tab item header""></p>

<ul>
<li>to remove the embedded manifest file from the generated application (in the project properties) : useless.</li>

&lt;/ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries&gt;
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>This last attempt worked great for all controls, except the tab control which still displays as above.</p>

<p>Any idea ?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> : I am suspecting this behaviour is due to the custom style I have to apply to the tab control :</p>

"820866","<h1>Solution (kinda):</h1>

<p>Turns out this impersonation with .NET's security only allows application-level access. Since the COM object is at the system level, the impersonated user still cannot instantiate it.  I figured this out by right-clicking the executable and selecting ""Run As..."", the program functioned fine. I found out that launches the program with system access (assuming the user you are running it with has those credentials). Now I am in the process of creating an external program that will launch this application using this method.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tips :D</p>

<p>I have a windows XP installation on a virtual machine. It is part of my domain, but the logged in user is a local user only. Obviously, if I try to access a network share it will prompt for a user/password:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/PgQAE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/PgQAE.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>The program I am testing out on the virtual machine uses a COM object to interface with data from another program. If I do not impersonate, I get errors because I do not have the proper credentials.</p>

<p>I did some research into the matter and found a number of websites that had a decent amount of VB.NET information. The problem I am having with the code I wrote is I can access the network resources, but I cannot instantiate the COM object.</p>

<p>If I fill and submit the credential prompt (above) before attempting to instantiate it, it works fine. That leads me to believe there must be something that the WinXP credential prompt is doing that I am not. Below is the code I am using for Impersonation:</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub BeginImpersonation()
    Const LOGON32_PROVIDER_DEFAULT As Integer = 0
    Const LOGON32_LOGON_INTERACTIVE As Integer = 2
    Const SecurityImpersonation As Integer = 2

    Dim win32ErrorNumber As Integer

    _tokenHandle = IntPtr.Zero
    _dupeTokenHandle = IntPtr.Zero

"821029","<p>I have a design problem which I would like some input on. Here are the constraints:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each user must have a working e-mail address when registering their account. When registering their user account an activation email should be sent, containing a link with an activation code which must be followed for the account to be activated.</li>
<li>Each user account exists in exactly one office which exists in exactly one company.</li>
<li>The first registered user from a company creates the company and one office. The rest of the company users are then invited by the first user.</li>
<li>The companies may interact with each other, but only if the companies first users are activated (i.e. they clicked their respective activation links after registering).</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is a small UML-diagram of how it could be solved:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/57X9f.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/57X9f.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>In the above diagram some details are left out. The diagram shows classes and fields only. When it comes to fields they're just used conceptually to show which information should be stored, please ignore their scope.</p>

<p>Some thoughts and questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>User and NotActivatedUser are mostly the same. Should they be one single class or separated? If they are separated, which form of Hibernate inheritance persistence would you use?</li>
<li>If an account isn't activated after a certain time it should be removed. If it was the first user, which also created the users Company and Office both of these should be removed too. Do we need NotActivatedOffice and NotActivatedCompany as well? (For clean separation in the database.)</li>
</ul>

<p>How would you design this kind of solution? Do you feel keeping non active and active entities separate in the database is important? Why or why not?</p>
","Design of account e-mail activation (with Hibernate in mind)","<hibernate>","2009-05-04 17:22:21","964","821202","4","<p>I would not use inheritance to represent a state (activated/deactivated) of your User objects. Composition (aggregation) is a much better choice here.</p>

<p>By using aggregation, AbstractUser simply becomes User. You may wish to model the Activation with a class instead of polluting the User class with activation related attributes. This way you get a nice and clean object model. </p>

<p>At the database level you can still decide to store the two objects in the same table/record, known as <a href=""http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/core/reference/en/html/components.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Component mapping</a>. Or you can decide to store User and Activation in separate tables (aka <a href=""http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/annotations/reference/fr/html/entity.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Entity mapping</a>). </p>

<p>Hibernate supports both type of mappings, it's mostly a matter of configuration.</p>

<p>The User class would contain the following attributes: </p>

<ul>
<li>givenName</li>
<li>surname</li>
<li>email</li>
<li>activation (reference to an Activation object)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Activation class would contain the following attributes: </p>

<ul>
<li>activationCode (string)</li>
<li>sentOn (when was the email sent)</li>
<li>activatedOn (defaults to null, set to current date/time when the user clicks the activation link, tells the system if the user has activated his account when not null)</li>
</ul>

<p>You could use an HQL Query to know which company has at least one activated user:</p>

<pre><code>from Office o 
   left join fetch o.company 
where 
   o.administrator.activatedOn != null
</code></pre>

<p>This query assumes that you have defined an 'administrator' attribute in your Office class. The 'administrator' would be a reference to the User who created the Office. In the database, the 'offices' table has a foreign key to a User record. </p>

<p>By modeling the relationship this way, you may change the Administrator of an Office (example, he left or got fired from the Office/Company). It all depends on your use cases ...</p>

<p>I also added a sentOn attribute to the Activation class used to cleanup inactivated account after a certain time (was missing in your UML diagram).</p>

"822899","<p>I've always wanted to create custom components in Java, or customize existing ones, but my searches never resulted in anything useful. So I decided to ask the StackOverflow community:</p>

<p><strong>Where can I find information about customizing Java GUI Components in general?</strong></p>

<p>And when I mean customizing, I'm not talking about changing colors, fonts etc. I mean <strong>really</strong> customize them. Here are two mockup example components:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/t36RA.jpg"" alt=""Custom Components Mockup""></p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong><br>
I started this question mainly to find how to create the above two custom components. But then I realized that there isn't a general question about hacking swing components. So I thought it would be better to have a list of resources.</p>

<p>In case you are wondering how do the two components in the mockup work, here it is:</p>

<p>A customized JScrollPane that has two Scrollbars for each orientation. Each scrollbar can act differently. For example, the outer ones scroll normally and the inner ones move the view in a more <a href=""http://picasa.google.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Picasa</a>-like way. I actually got a working(!) answer from google groups <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.java.programmer/browse_thread/thread/7a3c3558d7924661/11e7beb95c003575?#11e7beb95c003575"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, but that was just code.</p>

<p>The second one is a custom JComboBox which, when the popup list is expanded, has a JComponent at the end. This can be anything, from a simple JLabel with an icon, to a JButton that manipulates the list in a way.</p>

<p>But this question isn't about those specific components. It's about <strong>finding resources (websites, books, articles etc.) to learn how to create them</strong>. </p>

I have to admit, the implementation will be a little retarded, since you need to do a few things.</p>

<p>1 -  Tokenize the entire cell content, and store the tokens into a string array.</p>

<p>There is a problem already. The text located inside the cell is grossly inconsistent.  You have -250 ms, - 250 ms, - 1sec, - 1 sec. Due to this, you are going to need to check for each instance. Therefore, you cannot just check if the value is a number, you need to check all the permutations that your team members have conveniently provided for you.</p>

<p>The best way to do this would be to check against Regular Expressions.  Therefore, #2 should be:</p>

<p>2 -  Check each value to see if it matches to one of many 4 Regular Expressions.</p>

<p>3 -  Depending on the Regex it matches with, extract the numerical value.</p>

<p>a) If simply a value (ie->250), check if ms or sec proceeds the value.  IF ms, divide the number by 1000.  If sec, leave number as is.  Add number to total.<br>
b)  If a number preceded by a dash(-), remove dash, and repeat step a)<br>
c)  If a number followed by letters, remove letters and repeat step a)<br>
d)  If a number followed by a period, do nothing. This is a bullet point.</p>

There is nothing special about the actual variable used to pass a reference into <code>Monitor.Enter()</code>. Changing the reference should not prevent other threads from acquiring an exclusive lock, as the variable has a new value, and that reference is not locked anywhere.</p>

<p>Your issue comes with the <code>Exit</code>, because the thread calling <code>Exit</code> does not have an exclusive lock on the reference being passed in. Another thread may well have a lock on it, but the thread you're executing in does not.</p>

"832871","<p>I have a WCF client/server app which is communicating over HTTP using the WSHttpBinding.</p>

<p><strong>Server Setup</strong>: self-hosting, using the standard WCF <code>ServiceHost</code>.
My actual service class is attributed as:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceBehavior(ConcurrencyMode = ConcurrencyMode.Multiple, 
 InstanceContextMode = InstanceContextMode.PerSession, 
 UseSynchronizationContext = false)]
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Client Setup</strong>: using a visual-studio generated client proxy using <em>synchronous</em> service calls (<code>proxy.call_server_method</code> blocks until such time as the server has responded in full.)</p>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong>:
I have one particular method call which takes 20 seconds to execute on the server. The client calls this method in a separate thread, so it is not being held up, and the <code>ConcurrencyMode.Multiple</code> means WCF should execute it in a separate thread on the server as well.</p>

<p>This theory is supported by the fact that when I configure my app to use <code>NetTcpBinding</code>, everything works fine.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong>:<br>
If I configure the app to use <code>WSHttpBinding</code>, then this long method call causes the http requests to 'back up'. I have verified this behaviour both from inspecting my logs, and by debugging the HTTP requests using fiddler.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Client initiates 20-second long request on a background thread</li>
<li>Client initiates request B and C on foreground thread</li>
<li>Requests B and C get sent to the server, which doesn't process them until it is done with the 20-second long request</li>
</ul>

<p>But sometimes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Requests B and C <em>do not get sent</em> (they don't even appear in fiddler) until the 20-second request comes back  (this is rare).

<ul>
<li>Note: setting <code>&lt;add address=""*"" maxconnection=""100""/&gt;</code> in the client's app.config made this (appear to) stop happening.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Request B gets sent and receives a response immediately, while request C is held back until the 20-second one completes (this is rare)</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's a timeline from fiddler demonstrating the problem: (click for bigger version)</p>

<p><a href=""http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3311/3510636841_2a27435eec_o.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://farm4.static.flickr.com/3311/3510636841_18f9b2b0a1.jpg"" /></a></p>

<p>As you can see, the requests are all getting backed up at the server. Once the 20-second request completes, the responses all come flooding through, but note that there are some requests which <em>aren't</em> getting held up...</p>

<p>So, <strong>Questions</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>What the heck is going on here? Why does it work fine using <code>NetTcpBinding</code> and not work using <code>WSHttpBinding</code>?</li>
<li>Why the inconsistent behaviour?</li>
<li>What can I do to fix it?</li>
</ul>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>It's not locking on the server. I've set breakpoints and used <code>!syncblk</code> and it consistently reports no locks are being held.</li>
<li>It's not my threading (NetTcpBinding shouldn't work otherwise)</li>
<li>I have <code>&lt;serviceThrottling maxConcurrentCalls=""1000"" maxConcurrentInstances=""1000"" maxConcurrentSessions=""1000"" /&gt;</code> set in the server's app.config</li>
<li>The 20-second call is just waiting on a timer, it's not thrashing the CPU or disk or network</li>
<li>I'd prefer a solution that didn't involve re-architecting the application to use asynchronous calls... it's a big bunch of legacy code and I really don't want to be messing with stuff I don't understand.</li>

<p>In the end, I never managed to solve this.<br>
Our final solution was to switch our app away from <code>WSHttpBinding</code> and onto <code>NetTcpBinding</code> in production - we had been planning on doing this eventually anyway for performance reasons.</p>

<p>This is rather unfortunate though, as it leaves a black mark on <code>WSHttpBinding</code> which may or may not be warranted. If anyone does ever come up with a solution which does not involve ditching <code>WSHttpBinding</code>, I'd love to know about it</p>

        if (document.getElementById(comment_id).style.display == 'none') {

                document.getElementById(comment_id).style.display = 'block';
                document.getElementById(change_id).style.display = 'block';
            } else {

            }
        }   
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The script contains a hack to display the hidden div correctly in IE when another (initially hidden) div is also displayed in which changes can be made to the event. But never mind that.</p>

<p>The php-code to display the comment form looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>//Comment form, initially hidden
            echo ""&lt;div id=\""comment"" . $row-&gt;id . ""\"" class=\""submit-comment\"" style=\""display: none\""&gt;"";
            echo ""&lt;form name=\""make_comment\"" method=\""post\"" action=\""submit_comment.php\""&gt;"";
            echo ""Kommentar:&lt;br/&gt;"";
            echo ""&lt;textarea name=\""comment\"" class=\""comment\"" rows=\""0\"" cols=\""0\""&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"";
            echo ""&lt;input type=\""hidden\"" name=\""event_id\"" value=\""$row-&gt;id\""/&gt;"";
            echo ""&lt;input class=\""comment\"" type=\""submit\"" name=\""submit_comment\"" value=\""Skicka\"" /&gt;"";
            echo ""&lt;/form&gt;"";
            echo ""&lt;/div&gt;"";
</code></pre>

<p>This code lies inside a loop which displays all upcoming events that are stored in a mySQL database. As can be seen, the divs are given variable names like comment1, comment2, etc. in order to bind the comments to the correct event. </p>

<p>This is the code to display the comment-icon and linking it to the javascript:</p>

<pre><code>echo ""&lt;li class=\""icon-left\""&gt;
            &lt;a href=\""javascript:showhide_comment('comment"" . $row-&gt;id . ""', 'change"" . $row-&gt;id . ""')\""&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;"";
</code></pre>

<p>What I would like to do is to put the focus inside the correct textarea field that becomes visible when the comment-icon is clicked so that the user can start typing directly. I have tried to modify the javascript above using focus(), but I just can't get it to work. Any ideas on how I can achieve what I want?</p>

Hit detection is always done on the mask.</p>

<p>If you actually want the terrain to collapse like it did in Tank Wars, you'll need to iterate over each column of your image and have it search for gaps between the terrain and the bottom of the playing field.  If any gaps are detected, shift the terrain above the gap down to the lowest point possible in your column.</p>

<p>A simple example of this could be done with an array where 1 represents solid terrain and 0 represents empty space.  In this case, I've set up the left side of the array as ground level, to element <code>[0]</code> would be on the ground:</p>

<pre><code>[1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0]
</code></pre>

<p>Lets assume the terrain is struck from the side and a hole is made:</p>

<pre><code>[1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
</code></pre>

<p>You're now left with a floating piece of terrain above another piece of terrain.  To make the floating terrain collapse, iterate over the array, keeping track of the first position you find a 0 (empty space).  Then, as you continue to iterate, upon discovering a 1 (terrain) simply shift the 1 to where the 0 was.  Repeat the process by iterating from that the old 0 position + 1.</p>

<pre><code>[1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]

[1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0]
</code></pre>

<p>This is the basic approach, not the most efficient one.  It would be much faster to move <em>all</em> indexes of terrain above the gap down at the same time, for example.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>As the first comment states, a sort on the list is even easier.  I'm keeping my original response intact since it helps explains the actual principle behind the collapsing terrain.</p>

For the curious, my current application is to specify component dependencies for a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1622506/programming-definitions-what-exactly-is-building/1622520#1622520"">build system</a>, so vertices are components and edges specify  compile-time dependencies. Here is a simple example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;dag&gt;
    &lt;vertex name=""A""&gt;
        &lt;directed-edge-to vertex=""C""/&gt;
    &lt;/vertex&gt;
    &lt;vertex name=""B""&gt;
        &lt;directed-edge-to vertex=""C""/&gt;
        &lt;directed-edge-to vertex=""D""/&gt;
    &lt;/vertex&gt;
    &lt;vertex name=""C""&gt;
        &lt;directed-edge-to vertex=""E""/&gt;
    &lt;/vertex&gt;
    &lt;vertex name=""D""&gt;
        &lt;directed-edge-to vertex=""E""/&gt;
    &lt;/vertex&gt;
    &lt;vertex name=""E""&gt;
        &lt;directed-edge-to vertex=""G""/&gt;
    &lt;/vertex&gt;
    &lt;vertex name=""F""&gt;
        &lt;directed-edge-to vertex=""G""/&gt;
    &lt;/vertex&gt;
    &lt;vertex name=""G""/&gt;
&lt;/dag&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'd like to apply an <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XSLT</a> <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stylesheet</a> that produces another XML
document that contains only the vertices that correspond to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_element"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>minimal elements</em></a> of the partial order. That is, those vertices that have no incoming edges. The set of minimal vertices for the example graph is <code>{A, B, F}</code>. For my build dependency application, finding this set is valuable because I know that if I build the members of this set, then everything in my project will be built.</p>

<p>Here is my current stylesheet solution (I'm running this with Xalan on Java using Apache Ant's <code>xslt</code> task). A key observation is that a minimal vertex will not be referenced in any <code>directed-edge-to</code> element:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=""1.0""
                xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform""
                xmlns:xalan=""http://xml.apache.org/xslt""
                exclude-result-prefixes=""xalan""&gt;
    &lt;xsl:output method=""xml"" indent=""yes"" xalan:indent-amount=""4""/&gt;

    &lt;xsl:template match=""dag""&gt;
        &lt;minimal-vertices&gt;
            &lt;xsl:for-each select=""//vertex""&gt;
                &lt;xsl:if test=""not(//vertex/directed-edge-to[@vertex=current()/@name])""&gt;
                    &lt;minimal-vertex name=""{@name}""/&gt;
                &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
            &lt;/xsl:for-each&gt;
        &lt;/minimal-vertices&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Applying this stylesheet produces the following output (which I believe is correct):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;minimal-vertices&gt;
    &lt;minimal-vertex name=""A""/&gt;
    &lt;minimal-vertex name=""B""/&gt;
    &lt;minimal-vertex name=""F""/&gt;
&lt;/minimal-vertices&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The thing is, I'm not completely satisfied with this solution. <strong>I'm wondering if there is a way to combine the <code>select</code> of the <code>for-each</code> and the <code>test</code> of the <code>if</code> with XPath syntax.</strong></p>

<p>I want to write something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:for-each select=""//vertex[not(//vertex/directed-edge-to[@vertex=current()/@name])]""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But that does not do what I want because the <code>current()</code> function does not reference the nodes selected by the outer <code>//vertex</code> expression.</p>

<p>Thusfar, my solution uses <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XPath 1.0</a> and <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XSLT 1.0</a> syntax, though I'm open to <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath20/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XPath 2.0</a> and <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt20/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">XSLT 2.0</a> syntax as well.</p>

<p>Here's the Ant build script if you like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;project name=""minimal-dag"" default=""default""&gt;
    &lt;target name=""default""&gt;
        &lt;xslt in=""dag.xml"" out=""minimal-vertices.xml"" style=""find-minimal-vertices.xsl""/&gt;

    &lt;/target&gt;
&lt;/project&gt;

","Finding Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Minimal Elements (Vertices) with XSLT/XPath?","<xslt><xpath><graph-theory><directed-acyclic-graphs><build-system>","2009-05-09 19:28:10","3019","845082","2","<p>You can take advantage of XPath's implicit existential quantification on the <code>=</code> operator:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:for-each select=""//vertex[not(@name = //vertex/directed-edge-to/@vertex)]""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When you use any of the six comparison operators (<code>=</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, and <code>&gt;=</code>) to compare a node-set, the expression will return true if any node in the node-set satisfies the condition. When comparing one node-set with another, the expression returns true if any node in the first node-set satisfies the condition when compared with any node in the second node-set. XPath 2.0 introduces six new operators that don't perform this existential quantification (<code>eq</code>, <code>ne</code>, <code>lt</code>, <code>le</code>, <code>gt</code>, and <code>ge</code>). But in your case, you'll want to use ""<code>=</code>"" to get that existential quantification.</p>

<p>Note of course, that you'll still want to use the <code>not()</code> function as you were doing. Most of the time, it's good to avoid the <code>!=</code> operator. If you used it here instead of <code>not()</code>, then it would return true if there are any <code>@vertex</code> attributes that are not equal to the <code>@name</code> value, which is not your intention. (And if either node-set is empty, then it would return false, as comparisons with empty node-sets always return false.)</p>

<p>If you want to use <code>eq</code> instead, then you'd have to do something like you did: separate out the conditional from the iteration so you could bind <code>current()</code>. But in XPath 2.0, you can do this within an expression:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:for-each select=""for $v in //vertex
                      return $v[not(//directed-edge-to[@vertex eq $v/@name])]""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is useful for when your condition isn't a simple equality comparison (and thus can't be existentially quantified using ""<code>=</code>""). For example: <code>starts-with(@vertex, $v/@name)</code>.</p>

<p>XPath 2.0 also has an explicit way of performing existential quantification. Instead of the <code>for</code> expression above, we could have written this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:for-each select=""//vertex[not(some $e in //directed-edge-to
                                   satisfies @name eq $e/@vertex)]""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to the ""<code>some</code>"" syntax, XPath 2.0 also supplies a corresponding ""<code>every</code>"" syntax for performing <em>universal</em> quantification.</p>

<p>Rather than using <code>for-each</code>, you could also use template rules, which are more modular (and powerful):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=""1.0""
  xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform""&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match=""/""&gt;
    &lt;minimal-vertices&gt;
      &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
    &lt;/minimal-vertices&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;!-- Copy vertex elements that have no arrows pointing to them --&gt;
  &lt;xsl:template match=""vertex[not(@name = //directed-edge-to/@vertex)]""&gt;
    &lt;minimal-vertex name=""{@name}""/&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Again, in this case, we're relying on the existential quantification of <code>=</code>.</p>

<p>XSLT 1.0 prohibits use of the <code>current()</code> function in patterns, i.e., in the <code>match</code> attribute, but XSLT 2.0 allows it. In that case, <code>current()</code> refers to the node currently being matched. So in XSLT 2.0, we could also write this (without having to use a <code>for</code> expression):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:template match=""vertex[not(//directed-edge-to[@vertex eq current()/@name])]""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this pattern is essentially the same as the expression you tried to use in <code>for-each</code>, but whereas it doesn't do what you want in <code>for-each</code>, it <em>does</em> do what you want in the pattern (because what <code>current()</code> binds to is different).</p>

<p>Finally, I'll add one more variation that in some ways simplifies the logic (removing <code>not()</code>). This also goes back to using XSLT 1.0:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version=""1.0""
  xmlns:xsl=""http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform""&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match=""/""&gt;
    &lt;minimal-vertices&gt;
      &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;
    &lt;/minimal-vertices&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;!-- By default, copy vertex elements --&gt;
  &lt;xsl:template match=""vertex""&gt;
    &lt;minimal-vertex name=""{@name}""/&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;!-- But strip out vertices with incoming arrows --&gt;
  &lt;xsl:template match=""vertex[@name = //directed-edge-to/@vertex]""/&gt;

&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't like the whitespace being output, add an empty rule for text nodes, so they'll get stripped out (overriding the default rule for text nodes, which is to copy them):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:template match=""text()""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Or you could just be more selective in what nodes you apply templates to:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select=""/dag/vertex""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Which approach you take is partially dependent on taste, partially dependent on the wider context of your stylesheet and expected data (how much the input structure might vary, etc.).</p>

<p>I know I went way beyond what you were asking for, but I hope you at least found this interesting. :-)</p>

<h2>Why have rebasing?  Why not just pull/merge?</h2>
<p>The purpose of rebasing is to rewrite history so that your repository
reflects the way you believe your software should have evolved instead
of the way it actually did.  When is this important?  When you are a
junior member of a distributed development team, and you don't have
commit privileges—instead, all you can do is submit patches to a
gatekeeper and hope that they are accepted.  To maximize the chances
of acceptance, you want to rewrite history to make your patches as
clean and clear as possible.  Is the development model sounding familiar?</p>

"862848","<p>I have an application written in C# which uses Linq2SQL for communicating with the SQL Server. There are some queries that run a bit (very) slow, and I figure it probably need some indexes to speed things up.</p>

<p>But I don't really know how to do that or on what or where or what I should or should not do. So I was thinking I could ask here, but then I discovered the program called <em>Database Engine Tuning Advisor</em> which I thought I could try out first. The problem is I can't get it to work. It is probably me who just doesn't know how to, but I just can't really figure this out. As far as I can see, I have done what I am supposed to according to the help files.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open up <em>SQL Server Profiler</em>.</li>
<li>Start a new <em>Trace</em> using the <em>Tuning</em> template.</li>
<li>Start my application and do some things that generates SQL queries.</li>
<li>Close my application.</li>
<li>Stop the trace.</li>
<li>Save the trace as a <em>Trace file</em>.</li>
<li>Open <em>Database Engine Tuning Advisor</em></li>
<li>Choose <em>File</em> as <em>Workload</em> and select the <em>Trace file</em> I saved earlier.</li>
<li>Select the databases that my application uses under <em>Select databases and tables to tune</em>.</li>
<li>Click on <em>Start Analysis</em>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This far I thought things were going ok. But when it finishes after a while short while, I get this:</p>

<p>However, the normal solution would be to add all your custom initialization code in the awakeFromNib: method, this is called after the nib is loaded and all outlets are connected, so it makes a great place to do any initialization you need.</p>

<p>See the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ApplicationKit/Protocols/NSNibAwaking_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/NSObject/awakeFromNib"" rel=""noreferrer"">Apple docs on <code>awakeFromNib:</code></a> for details on object instantiation from nibs. Also, if you have access to the 3.0 beta docs, do a search for <code>awakeFromNib:</code>, the updated wording gives a better explanation of which methods are called and when.</p>

<p>P.S. You shouldn't be calling <code>[jokeTableView init]</code> in your code, this will be done automatically when the nib is unpacked.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Since you are setting properties for your table view from your initialization code, this should definitely be in <code>awakeFromNib:</code>, not <code>initWithCoder:</code> or <code>initWithStyle:</code>.</p>

<p>Looking at the screenshot, you might also want to make sure with Interface Builder that the UITableView is placed correctly in the nib file for your view controller, and that the code (or nib) that creates your view controller is referring to the right nib file - if it were just the data for the table view that had not loaded, you would see gray lines between empty cells, not just blank white space like in that image.</p>

"873432","<p>Recently I started using <a href=""https://download.netbeans.org/netbeans/6.7/beta/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NetBeans 6.7 beta</a> for PHP development instead of <a href=""https://macromates.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Textmate</a> and <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190331020751/https://www.bluestatic.org/software/macgdbp/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MacGDBp</a>. I am rather amazed with it's feature set and most everything worked out of the box, or was easily configured to my liking.</p>

<p>I am having an issue with the code completion features though; they work for built-in functions, <a href=""https://www.php.net/spl"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""Standard PHP Library"">SPL</a> and some of my code, but not all of my code, specifically, it never works for any methods in my classes, regardless of PHPDoc comments.</p>

<p>I can't seem to find any decent questions, let alone answers about this specific subject anywhere. It looks like everybody else who has problems with the code completion just hasn't enabled the auto-popup feature.</p>

<p><strong>So the big question is:</strong></p>

<p>Is there <em>any way</em> to influence the code completion cache, or something I have to add to my code to make it work? I'd really like to have code completion for the methods I write.</p>

<p><strong>PS</strong>: I have tried several older versions of netbeans, they all exhibit the same problem.</p>

"874589","<p>I've built a custom UI for my table that has a darker UI and a custom accessoryView.  When I put the table into editing mode, there is a white line to the left of the reorder control that I can't seem to get rid of.  </p>

<p><em>tableView:accessoryTypeForRowWithIndexPath:</em> doesn't seem to be appropriate for getting rid of it since I'm not using a standard UITableViewCellAccessoryType, so I'm not sure of what I can do to get it to not show up on my cells.  </p>

","Remove white line next to reorder control on grouped UITableViewCell","<iphone><cocoa-touch><uitableview>","2009-05-17 13:09:31","3561","875971","5","<p>What is happening is that when UITableViewCell shows the reorder control it also adds an empty, 1 pixel wide, white UIView to its array of subviews.</p>

<p>Bluntly: this is a bug that Apple should fix.</p>

<p>However, you can get around it by finding that annoying view every time it appears and setting its background color to transparent. <strong>Quick tip</strong>: the annoying white view is always the last in the UITableViewCell's subviews array and is always 1 pixel wide. We will use this to find it.</p>

<p>When you turn editing on for the table, make all of the visible annoying 1 pixel views transparent. So the action method which toggles ""edit"" mode on the table might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (IBAction)edit:(id)sender
{
    [tableView setEditing:!tableView.editing animated:YES];

    for (UITableViewCell *cell in [tableView visibleCells])
    {
        if (((UIView *)[cell.subviews lastObject]).frame.size.width == 1.0)
        {
            ((UIView *)[cell.subviews lastObject]).backgroundColor =
                [UIColor clearColor];
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and keep doing so for all new views as they become visible by implementing this in your UITableViewDelegate:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView
    willDisplayCell:(UITableViewCell *)cell]
    forRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
{
    if (((UIView *)[cell.subviews lastObject]).frame.size.width == 1.0)
    {
        ((UIView *)[cell.subviews lastObject]).backgroundColor =
             [UIColor clearColor];
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This hack to fix the problem is fairly innocuous and if Apple fix the bug in future (stop adding the annoying 1 pixel view), this code should quietly stop doing anything.</p>

"874662","<p>I have been trying very hard to achieve rounded corners with IE6+jquery ui tabs. </p>

<p>I have this page prepared: <a href=""http://jsbin.com/uzoko"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://jsbin.com/uzoko</a> (w/out dd_roundies)</p>

<p>Ofcourse, the rounded corners work in FF but not IE6.  Because some of the properties used in CSS are specific to FF and Chrome.  </p>

<p>I had asked this question yesterday <img src=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/872816/how-to-work-with-jquery-ui-tabs-in-ie-6"" alt=""as well""> and based on that suggestion I used the DD_Roundies library.  However, the sample page I provided up top doesnt have the ability to add DD_Roundies library so I cant really 'show' what exactly is wrong with the page when it is openeing in css.  </p>

<p>But after implementing DD_Roundies I can see the rounded corners in IE6 fine.  HOWEVER, I have following problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>ONLY the 'First' tabs seems to have rounded corners. When i click on second tab, it doesnt have rounded corners and so doesnt the third. </li>
<li>when I move away from First tab, it seems to have a border with color #990000.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of this does not happen in FF @#$%@$!!</p>

<p>Since I am unable to put DD_Roundies library code in jsbin I will put what I have relative to dd_roundies on my page, here:</p>

<pre><code>        DD_roundies.addRule('.ui-corner-all', '4px');
        DD_roundies.addRule('.ui-corner-top', '2px 2px 0px 0px');
        DD_roundies.addRule('.ui-corner-bottom', '0 0 4px 4px');
        DD_roundies.addRule('.ui-corner-right', '0 4px 4px 0');
        DD_roundies.addRule('.ui-corner-left', '4px 0 0 4px');
        DD_roundies.addRule('.ui-corner-tl', '4px 0 0 0');
        DD_roundies.addRule('.ui-corner-tr', '0 4px 0 0');
        DD_roundies.addRule('.ui-corner-br', '0 0 4px 0');
        DD_roundies.addRule('.ui-corner-bl', '0 0 0 4px');
</code></pre>

<p>I am not good at CSS to begin with and then correcting css so it works with freaking ie6 is whole another battle that I can use some help in.  Please!</p>

<p>Also, as suggested in the question I asked yesterday, I tried using images as well.  I used cornershop website to create two rounded corner images.  <a href=""http://tinypic.com/r/30j1rgz/5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://tinypic.com/r/30j1rgz/5</a> and <a href=""http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=50joqq&amp;s=5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=50joqq&amp;s=5</a> but with these when  I changed 'Interaction States' section of the css and property <code>.ui-state-active a, .ui-state-active a:link, .ui-state-active a:visited</code> to the following </p>

<pre><code>background: #990000;

<p>I would like a more fine grained sorting when it comes to methods. I would like to:</p>

When I create a Web service SoapUI project and send SOAP request for an operation, I get a response XML. Now after saving the soapUI and exiting the tool - when I open it again I see the response XML tab as empty.

</p>

<p>Why only request gets saved and not responses - Is it a bug in SoapUI ?</p>

<p>Thanks

SoapUI is intended for testing; if you want to save your test results, you'll have to do that explicitly.</p>

<p>To save a specific response message, use the context menu of the response editor, (or press Ctrl+S), and save it to file.  You can load it back if you want, using the same context menu (or press Ctrl+L).</p>

"883510","<p>I think I've found the cause: Document Info window in IB has a warning: <em>""'Selected Navigation Controller (Second)' has nib name property set to 'SecondView.nib', but this view controller is not intended to have its view set in this manner.""</em></p>

<p>Bummer.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've built nib in Interface Builder that has <code>UITabBarController</code> at top level and switches between <code>UINavigationController</code>s.</p>

<p>It works fine when everything is in a single <code>nib</code> file, but I'd like to use separate <code>nib</code> files for <code>UINavigationController</code>s.</p>

<p>Starting with Apple's TabBar template, if I just change class of SecondView to <code>UINavigationController</code>, it all breaks:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/OQrQ9.png"" alt=""second nib""> </p>

<p>and all I get is this:</p>

<pre><code>// imgur has lost the image, sorry //
</code></pre>

<p>Is it possible to have separate file for <code>UINavigationController</code> without programmatically setting everything?</p>

<p>I would like <code>TabBarController</code> to handle loading and unloading of nibs.</p>

<p>You set the nib of First View Controller in the inspector to the nib file containing the actual view objects (Since you are trying to split them into separate files, which is a good thing).</p>

<p>You have one tab, that tab has a navigation controller which loads First View Controller as its root view.</p>

<p>One slightly hackish way to do it is set Focusable on the ComboBox to False and then set Focusable on the TextBlock (or Label) to True. This should make it so the TextBlock gets focus whenever the ComboBox should. </p>

<p>My best guess though is that you have some weird margins going on, the real way to fix it would be to straighten those out.</p>

"890890","<p>I noticed that in Windows 7, unlike XP, if a program crashes that I am debugging in Visual Studio 2008, I don't get the option to Debug the program.  Rather, it just says that the program crashed and Microsoft is looking for a solution.</p>

<p>Right now, if my program throws an exception, I can't return back to the debugging session in VS 2008, the program just quits.  Is there a way around this?</p>

"894607","<p>I have a winform app that has tabcontrols that are 3 layers deep.  I am dynamically coloring the tabs with the below class.  When it goes to color an embedded tabcontrol it pitches a fit.  </p>

<p>As you can see there are 3 layers of tab controls.  This occurs twice in the program and both cause the mentioned error.  There are 6 calls to tabRenderer in total as there are 5 tab controls. 1 Top Level, 3 Second Level and 2 Third Level.</p>

<p>The code being used to Color the Tab Controls:</p>

<pre><code>public class psTabRenderer

    private TabControl _tabControl;
    private Color _fillColor;
    private Color _selectedFillColor;

        //Set up rotation for left and right aligned tabs
        if (_tabControl.Alignment == TabAlignment.Left || _tabControl.Alignment == TabAlignment.Right)
        {
            float rotateAngle = 90;

            var cp = new PointF(itemRect.Left + (itemRect.Width / 2), itemRect.Top + (itemRect.Height / 2));

            e.Graphics.RotateTransform(rotateAngle);
            itemRect = new Rectangle(-(itemRect.Height / 2), -(itemRect.Width / 2), itemRect.Height, itemRect.Width);
        }

        //Next we'll paint the TabItem with our Fill Brush
        e.Graphics.FillRectangle(fillBrush, itemRect);

        //Now draw the text.
        e.Graphics.DrawString(currentTab.Text, e.Font, textBrush, (RectangleF)itemRect, sf);

        //Reset any Graphics rotation
        e.Graphics.ResetTransform();

        //Finally, we should Dispose of our brushes.
        fillBrush.Dispose();

I pulled that call out to a PaintTabs() function and then wait for the first to finish before it calls the next(I think?).  </p>

<p>Either way it no longer generates any errors.  I now call it like so from the TOP LEVEL TabControl:</p>

I'm not sure why you did, but you shouldn't need to. From the <code>--squash</code> documentation for git merge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Produce the working tree and index
  state as if a real merge happened, but
  do not actually make a commit or move
  the HEAD, nor record
  $GIT_DIR/MERGE_HEAD to cause the next
  git commit command to create a merge
  commit. This allows you to create a
  single commit on top of the current
  branch whose effect is the same as
  merging another branch (or more in
  case of an octopus).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, you need to do a ""proper"" merge. Squashing seems to have a rather specific usage situation (one that I've never had, so I can't really comment on <em>why</em> it's useful). I <em>guess</em> it's if you don't want the branch tree to look messy if you did some work in a branch but then decided to just merge it into a different branch that you're doing more overarching work in.</p>

"906028","<p>I'm designing a new protocol called DITP. It is a connection oriented protocol that would use TCP as transport layer. With common Internet protocols, when the TCP connection is established, the server starts by sending a greeting message to what the client respond, eventually sending its first request.</p>

<p>EDITED:
I have a list of coordinates with people stood by them - I need an algorithm to order people from top left to bottom right in a list (array), and the second criteria demands that coordinates that are closer towards the top left origin take prescendance over all others - how would you do this?  </p>

<p>The code should show the order as:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tom </li>
<li>Harry</li>
<li>Bob</li>
<li>Dave</li>

This comparison still works with your new criteria.  Y position is still has precedence over the X position.  If the Y values are equal, the point closest to the top left corner would be the one with the smaller X value.  If you want to make your object a comparator, implementing this as your comparator function would allow you to do ArrayList.sort() where negative means the first person is before the second:</p>

<pre><code>public int compareTo(person a, person b) {
    if (a.y == b.y)

"918734","<p>in my (puzzle) game the pieces are drawn on-screen using a <code>CALayer</code> for each piece. There are 48 pieces (in an 8x6 grid) with each piece being 48x48 pixels. I'm not sure if this is just too many layers, but if this isn't the best solution I don't know what is, because redrawing the whole display using Quartz2D every frame doesn't seem like it would be any faster.</p>

<p>Anyway, the images for the pieces come from one big PNG file that has 24 frames of animation for 10 different states (so measures 1152 x 480 pixels) and the animation is done by setting the <code>contentsRect</code> property of each <code>CALayer</code> as I move it.</p>

<p>This actually seems to work pretty well with up to 7 pieces tracking a touch point in the window, but the weird thing is that when I initially start moving the pieces, for the first 0.5 a second or so, it's very jerky like the CPU is doing something else, but after that it'll track and update the screen at 40+ FPS (according to Instruments). </p>

<p>So does anyone have any ideas what could account for that initial jerkiness? </p>

<p>The only theory I could come up with is it's decompressing bits of the PNG file into a temporary location and then discarding them after the animation has stopped, in which case is there a way to stop Core Animation doing that?</p>

<p>I could obviously split the PNG file up into 10 pieces, but I'm not convinced that would help as they'd all (potentially) still need to be in memory at once.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> OK, as described in the comment to the first answer, I've split the image up into ten pieces that are now 576 x 96, so as to fit in with the constraints of the hardware. It's still not as smooth as it should be though, so I've put a bounty on this.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong> I've linked one of the images below. Essentially the user's touch is tracked, the offset from the start of the tracking is calculated (they can one move horizontal or vertical and only one place at a time). Then one of the images is selected as the content of the layer (depending on what type of piece it is and whether it's moving horizontally or vertically). Then the <code>contentsRect</code> property is set to chose one 48x48 frame from the larger image with something like this:-</p>

<pre><code>layer.position = newPos;
layer.contents = (id)BallImg[imgNum];
layer.contentsRect = CGRectMake((1.0/12.0)*(float)(frame % 12), 
                                0.5 * (float)(frame / 12), 
                                1.0/12.0, 0.5); 
</code></pre>

<p>btw. My theory about it decompressing the source image a-fresh each time wasn't right. I wrote some code to copy the raw pixels from the decoded PNG file into a fresh <code>CGImage</code> when the app loads and it didn't make any difference.</p>

<p>Next thing I'll try is copying each frame into a separate <code>CGImage</code> which will get rid of the ugly <code>contentsRect</code> calculation at least.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Wxm6J.png"" alt=""Sample image""></p>

<p><strong>EDIT3:</strong> Further back-to-basics investigation points to this being a problem with touch tracking and not a problem with Core Animation at all. I found a basic sample app that tracks touches and commented out the code that actually causes the screen to redraw and the <code>NSLog()</code> shows the exactly the same problem I've been experiencing: A long-ish delay between the <code>touchesBegin</code> and first <code>touchesMoved</code> events.</p>

<pre><code>2009-06-05 01:22:37.209 TouchDemo[234:207] Begin Touch ID 0 Tracking with image 2
2009-06-05 01:22:37.432 TouchDemo[234:207] Touch ID 0 Tracking with image 2

2009-06-05 01:22:37.480 TouchDemo[234:207] Touch ID 0 Tracking with image 2
</code></pre>

<p>Typical gap between <code>touchesMoved</code> events is 20ms. The gap between the <code>touchesBegin</code> and first <code>touchesMoved</code> is ten times that. And that's with no computation or screen updating at all, just the <code>NSLog</code> call. Sigh. I guess I'll open this up a separate question. </p>

"925440","<p>I am quite new to Cocoa and to iPhone programming.</p>

<p>I am using the Xcode <em>Utility Application</em> template to implement a simple app that has:</p>

<li>a view with a <strong>text field</strong> to collect a username </li>
<li>a view with a <strong>connect button</strong> to start a connection to a remote site using the
username to get some data via HTTP. The data will be presented as a text string on the screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this represents my <strong>VIEW</strong> in the MVC pattern.</p>

<p>It's in most cases ok to have state in your controller. Like an array or an instance of whatever modelobject you are writing an application for.</p>

<p>I would keep the model object clean of any networking code and put that in the Controller instead though. In this case the ViewController where that connection action is triggered.</p>

<p>With the utility application template you already have a couple of ViewControllers.</p>

<p>To get references to your UI inside your controllers you need to declare <code>IBOutlets</code> and connect them inside Interface Builder. To respond to actions you need to declare and implement <code>IBActions</code> in your ViewControllers and hook them up in Interface Builder as well. Which you do in Connections pane (2nd from left) in the inspector.</p>

"926172","<p>I discovered that it is possible to extract the hard-coded strings from a binary.<br>
For example the properties view of <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Process Explorer</a> displays all the string with more than 3 characters.</p>

<p>Here is the code of a simple executable that I wrote to simply test it:</p>

{
    _TCHAR* hiddenString1 =_T(""4537774B-CC80-4eda-B3E4-7A9EE77991F5"");
    _TCHAR* hiddenString2 =_T(""hidden_password_or_whatever"");
    for (int i= 0; i&lt;argc; i++) {
        if (0 == _tcscmp(argv[i],hiddenString1)) {
            _tprintf (_T(""The guid argument is correct.\n"")); }
        else if (0 == _tcscmp(argv[i],hiddenString2)) {
            _tprintf (_T(""Do something here.\n"")); }
    }

    _tprintf (_T(""This is a visible string.\n""));
    //Keep Running
    Sleep(60000);
    return 0;
}

<p>The strings can clearly be extracted from the corresponding executable:<br>
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/3k8mN.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I think that it is a little too easy to find the strings.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>How to <strong>simply</strong> hide <em>hiddenString1</em> or <em>hiddenString2</em> in the
executable?</li>
<li>Is there a more secure
way to use ""cheat code"" than with
some obscure hidden input?</li>

<p>There are a couple of options, but I believe all of them depend on some form of obfuscation; which, although not perfect, is at least something.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Instead of a straight string value you can store the text in some other binary form (hex?).</p></li>
<li><p>You can encrypt the strings that are stored in your app, then decrypt them at run time.</p></li>
<li><p>You can split them across various points in your code, and reconstitute later.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Or some combination thereof.  </p>

<p>Bear in mind, that some attacks go further than looking at the actual binary.  Sometimes they will investigate the memory address space of the program while it's running.  MS came up with something called a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.security.securestring.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">SecureString in .Net 2.0</a>.  The purpose being to keep the strings encrypted while the app is running.</p>

<p>A fourth idea is to not store the string in the app itself, but rather rely on a validation code to be submitted to a server you control.  On the server you can verify if it's a legit ""cheat code"" or not.</p>

<p>The website is an eBay like service (in a specific niche). I would like to get your opinion about whether or not this kind of layout can work on a site like this (many categories, browsing, searching post, reading description, etc).</p>

<p>I noticed that all eBay like websites and big online stores like Amazon, have white background. In order to make something a bit different for our future users (a side from the little twist the our service we'll provide) we wanted to create a none-standard look, but still practical and solid for long usage.</p>

<p>Since its not a classic ""white on black"" vs. ""Black on white"" layout, but a sort of a hybrid, I wanted to get your opinion.</p>

<p>The site is meant to be used by both private consumers and corporate users.</p>

<p>If you have have any references for similar layouts of big sites (hopefully the same kind of websites), please post them.</p>

<p>Additionally, I was wondring if this kind of a website should have a fluid layout (stretches as the resolution gets higher) or fixed layout (centered and optimized for 1024x768).</p>

<p>Thanks for the help in advance.</p>

<p>Honestly your users will probably care more about the quality of your service than the colors you choose as your background.  If your service is compelling it won't matter unless the colors are garishly ugly.</p>

<p>As far as flow-layout, it's always a good idea to support higher resolutions, but only if it makes sense.  By that I mean that some content (e.g. large amounts of text) have upper limits on line width which affect readability so your flow layout has to be smart -- it can't just be width=100% or some such shortcut.</p>

<p>Another thing I would keep in mind if you're creating a service to be used by all people is allow for SMALLER than 1024x768.  By that I mean larger fonts crammed into that resolution.  Some people can't see so well and the wider the demographic, the more flexible your layout should be.</p>

","Clipping FFT Matrix","<python><audio><signal-processing><fft>","2009-05-31 23:15:35","5329","933271","4","<p>Simulated waveforms shouldn't show FFTs like your figure, so something is very wrong, and probably not with the FFT, but with the input waveform.  The main problem in your plot is not the ripples, but the harmonics around 1000 Hz, and the subharmonic at 500 Hz.  A simulated waveform shouldn't show any of this (for example, see my plot below).</p>

<p>First, you probably want to just try plotting out the raw waveform, and this will likely point to an obvious problem.  Also, it seems odd to have a wave unpack to unsigned shorts, i.e. ""H"", and especially after this to not have a large zero-frequency component.</p>

<p>I was able to get a pretty close duplicate to your FFT by applying clipping to the  waveform, as was suggested by both the subharmonic and higher harmonics (and Trevor).  You could be introducing clipping either in the simulation or the unpacking.  Either way, I bypassed this by creating the waveforms in numpy to start with.</p>

<p>Here's what the proper FFT should look like (i.e. basically perfect, except for the broadening of the peaks  due to the windowing)</p>

"937150","<p>I work for a firm that provides certain types of financial consulting services in most states in the US. We currently have a fairly straightforward CRUD application that manages clients and information about assets and services we perform for each. It only concerns itself with the fundamental data points and processes that are common to all locations--the least common denominator.</p>
<p>Now we want to implement support for tracking disparate data points and processes that vary from state to state while preserving the core nationally-oriented system. Like this:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/tkJAx.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/tkJAx.png"" alt=""NationalWithStates"" /></a><br />

<p>The stack I'm working with is ASP.Net and SQL Server 2008. The national application is a fairly straightforward web forms thing. Its data access layer is a repository wrapper around LINQ to SQL entities and datacontext. There is little business logic beyond CRUD operations currently, but there would be more as the complexities of each state were introduced.</p>
<p>So, how to impelement the satellite pieces...</p>
<ul>
<li>Just start glomming on the functionality and pursue a big ball of mud</li>
<li>Build a series of satellite apps that re-use the data-access layer but are otherwise stand-alone</li>
<li>Invest (money and/or time) in a rules engine (a la Windows Workflow) and isolate the unique bits for each state as separate rule-sets</li>
<li>Invest (time) in a plugin framework a la MEF and implement each state's functionality as a plugin</li>
<li>Something else</li>
</ul>
<p>The ideal user experience would appear as a single application that seamlessly adapts its presentation and processes to whatever location the user is working with. This is particularly useful because some users work with assets in multiple states. So there is a strike against number two.</p>
<p>I have no experience with MEF or WF so my question in large part is whether or not mine is even the type of problem either is intended to address. They both kinda sound like it based on the hype, but could turn out to be a square peg for a round hole.</p>
<p>In all cases each state introduces new data points, not just new processes, so I would imagine the data access layer would grow to accommodate the addition of new tables and columns, but I'm all for alternatives to that as well.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I tried to think of some examples I could share. One might be that in one state we submit certain legal filings involving client assets. The filing has attributes and workflow that are different from other states that may require similar filings, and the assets involved may have quite different attributes. Other states may not have comparable filings at all, still others may have a series of escalating filings that require knowledge of additional related entities unique to that state.</p>
","Architecture for Satellite Parts of a Larger Application","<asp.net><architecture>","2009-06-01 22:36:53","172","938036","2","<p>Start with the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Strategy</a> design pattern, which basically allows you outline a ""placeholder"", to be replaced by concrete classes at runtime.  </p>

<p>You'll have to sketch out a clear interface between the core app and the ""plugins"", and you have each strategy implement that. Then, at runtime, when you know which state the user is working on, you can instantiate the appropriate state strategy class (perhaps using a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">factory method</a>), and call the generic methods on that, e.g. something like</p>

<pre><code>IStateStrategy stateStrategy = StateSelector.GetStateStrategy(""TX""); //State id from db, of course...
stateStrategy.Process(nationalData);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, each of these strategies should use the existing data layer, etc.  </p>

<p>The (apparent) downside with this solution, is just that you'll be hardcoding the rules for each state, and you cannot transparently add new rules (or new states) without changing the code. Don't be fooled, <a href=""http://thedailywtf.com/articles/soft_coding.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">that's not a bad thing</a> - your business logic <em>should</em> be implemented in code, even if its dependent on runtime data.</p>

"937957","<p>I created a plist that contains an NSDictionary structure. The key is a label (which I use to populate tableview cell.text) and the value is a file name that I want to use to 'dynamically' populate cell.image. The exact png filenames are loaded into the project.</p>

<p>To make things easier (so I thought), I load the plist into an NSDictionary, then pull that apart into two arrays (using allKeys and allValues).</p>

<p>In attempting to set a cell image, I dont understand why this works:</p>

<pre><code>cell.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""bad.png""];
</code></pre>

<p>and this does not (in simulator - I get an app crash and barfing in debugger):</p>

<pre><code>cell.image = [UIImage imageNamed:[rowImageList objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]];
</code></pre>

<p>I can put this next line right before the second piece of code and it works just fine, so it appears that I am getting an NSString from objectAtIndex:</p>

<pre><code>NSLog(@""Image name: %@"", [rowImageList objectAtIndex:indexPath.row]);
</code></pre>

<p>I have also tried creating a temp NSString and assigning [rowImageList objectAtIndex:] to it, then using that NSString to supply imageNamed:.</p>

<p>Here is some info from debugger:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-[NSCFArray length]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x262d910</p>

<pre><code>NSArray *myRowImages = [[NSArray alloc] init]; 
myRowImages = [searchFilterList allValues]; 
self.rowImageList = [myRowImages copy]; 
[myRowImages release]; 
//where searchFilterList is an NSDictionary that I loaded from a plist

   display:none; /* it will be revealed on hover */
}
div.action:hover div.popout {
   display:block;

<p>To make this work in old versions of IE you can add this JavaScript to the action div:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""action"" onmouseover=""""this.className='action hover'"" onmouseout=""this.className='action'""&gt;

<p>Then use a class of hover instead of the state:</p>

"948336","<p>Calculating the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-core"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">k-core</a> of a graph by iteratively pruning vertices is easy enough. However, for my application, I'd like to be able to add vertices to the starting graph and get the updated core without having to recompute the entire k-core from scratch. Is there a reliable algorithm that can take advantage of the work done on previous iterations?</p>

<p>For the curious, the k-core is being used as a preprocessing stage in a clique finding algorithm. Any cliques of size 5 are guaranteed to be part of the 4-core of a graph. In my data set, the 4-core is much smaller than the whole graph so brute-forcing it from there might be tractable. Incrementally adding vertices lets the algorithm work with as small of a data set as possible. My set of vertices is infinite and ordered (prime numbers), but I only care about the lowest numbered clique.</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Thinking about it some more based on akappa's answer, detecting the creation of a loop is indeed critical. In the graph below, the 2-core is empty before adding F. Adding F does not change the degree of A but it still adds A to the 2-core. It's easy to extend this to see how closing a loop of any size would cause all of the vertices to simultaneously join the 2-core.</p>

<p>Adding a vertex can have an effect on the coreness of vertices an arbitrary distance away, but perhaps this is focusing too much on worst-case behavior. </p>

<p>I think that the best you can do is to recompute the k-core algorithm at each pass, just removing from the graph the vertices that already are in the k-core and initializing, in the map vertex -> ""k-core adjacent vertices"" the number of adjacent vertices that already are in the k-core.</p>

<pre><code>Array
(
    [Set 1] =&gt; Array([0] =&gt; Item 1 of Set 1, [1] =&gt; Item 1 of Set 1,...)
    [Set 2] =&gt; Array([Subnet 1] =&gt; Array([0] =&gt; Item 1 of Subset 1 of Set 2,[1] =&gt; ...), [Subnet 2] =&gt; Array([0] =&gt; ..., ..., ...), ..., [0] =&gt; Random File)
    [set 3] =&gt; Array(...)
    ...
)

"954857","<p>I was just wondering how to handle a lot of states using ASP .NET and postbacks.</p>

<p>See this image:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/OJy6h.jpg"" alt=""see the image""></p>

<p>I know someone can use:</p>

<ul>
<li>javascript for client script that change <code>&lt;input type=""text"" style=""display:none""/&gt;</code> controls for passing javascript variables to ASP .NET</li>
<li>use ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript for calling javascript function after postbacks</li>
<li>reload content for dynamic controls after postback</li>
</ul>

<p>This introduce a lot of overhead, variables, states, messing and confusing code.<br/></p>

<p>I would normally do it:</p>

<ul>
<li>multiple pages</li>
<li>every page being a fully defined state</li>
<li>passing QueryString variables through pages</li>
<li>giving ""Back with one step"" option to the user</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My project manager won't let me do it in my own style.</strong><br/>

","How to handle multpile ASP .NET events, states, and postbacks on the same page?","<asp.net><postback>","2009-06-05 08:40:07","658","955113","1","<p>First of all, trying to use <code>&lt;input type=""text"" style=""display:none""/&gt;</code> you are reinventing the wheel. Use <code>&lt;input type='hidden' /&gt;</code> instead.<br>
The problem of too big pages is not in a ASP.NET AJAX (but I don't like it anyway) but in the ASP.NET webforms abstraction. Often viewstate becomes too large (60-70% of the page weight or more) and this is really bad. Also when you have only one form with a lot of editing controls in it all values of inputs (html inputs, in asp.net - textboxes, checkboxes and so on) will be sent back to the server on each postback. In my opinion this is bad, really bad. The solution is not to use webforms. You can try out ASP.NET MVC. Using it you easily can control all you need and there are no headache with viewstates, controlstates, page and control lifecycle, stupid ctl0$ctlSomeValue$ctlAnotherParam$MyCoolTextBox identifiers (this will be changed in ASP.NET 4). I made my choice - no more webforms, hello, mvc!<br>
About your situation. You can create a webservice (some RESTful or something like this) which will provide all methods to add/edit/move/delete items. And create a page which will use this service to add/create/move/delete items. This requires a good knowledge of JS or at least a big wish to learn it. I prefer this approach, there will be only small requests to do some actions on the page so user will be happy. And information on the page and state of the page will not be broken - all requests to the service will be through AJAX.<br>
Another solution is to manage all these states manually - in hidden fields, query variables and so on. This is veery thicky and hard approach for ASP.NET WebForms. And it will take a lot of time.<br>
So my advice is to move to MVC or to create some UI frontend for a service.<br>

Sounds like it might work for you, setup a custom build step (i.e. file copy) and associate it with the file types of your custom content files.</p>

","O(N log N) Complexity - Similar to linear?","<language-agnostic><complexity-theory><quicksort>","2009-06-07 18:59:16","116695","962551","7","<p>Make the graph bigger and you'll see that O(n logn) isn't quite a straight line. But yes, it is pretty near to linear behaviour. To see why, just take the logarithm of a few very large numbers.</p>
<p>For example (base 10):</p>
<pre><code>log(1000000) = 6
log(1000000000) = 9
…
</code></pre>
<p>So, to sort 1,000,000 numbers, an O(n logn) sorting adds a measly factor 6 (or just a bit more since most sorting algorithms will depend on base 2 logarithms). Not an awful lot.</p>
<p>In fact, this log factor is <em>so</em> extraordinarily small that for most orders of magnitude, established O(n logn) algorithms often outperform linear time algorithms. A prominent example is the creation of a suffix array data structure.</p>
<p>A similar case has recently bitten me <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/463105/in-place-radix-sort"">when I tried to improve a quicksort sorting of short strings by employing radix sort</a>. Short strings, this (linear time) radix sort was faster than quicksort, but there was a tipping point for still relatively short strings, since radix sort crucially depends on the length of the strings you sort.</p>

The point is that Windows keeps a short (8.3) filename for every file with a long filename, for backward compatibility, and filename <strong>wildcards are matched against both the long and short filenames</strong>. You can see these short filenames by opening a command prompt and running ""<code>dir /x</code>"". Normally, getting a list of files which match <code>????????.tif</code> (8) returns a list of file with 8 or less characters in their filename and a .tif extension. But <strong>every file with a long filename also has a short filename with 8.3 characters, so they all match this filter</strong>.</p>

<p>In your case both <code>GZ96A7005.tif</code> and <code>GZ96A7005001.tif</code> are long filenames, so they both have a 8.3 short filename which matches <code>????????.tif</code> (anything with 8 or more <code>?</code>'s).</p>

<p>UPDATE... from <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wz42302f.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSDN</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because this method checks against
  file names with both the 8.3 file name
  format and the long file name format,
  a search pattern similar to ""<code>*1*.txt</code>""
  may return unexpected file names. For
  example, using a search pattern of
  ""<code>*1*.txt</code>"" returns ""<code>longfilename.txt</code>""
  because the equivalent 8.3 file name
  format is ""<code>LONGFI~1.TXT</code>"".</p>

<p>UPDATE: The MSDN docs specifiy different behavior for the ""<code>?</code>"" wildcard in Directory.GetFiles() and DirectoryInfo.GetFiles(). The documentation seems to be wrong, however.

"965877","<p>Today I noticed that a few Google advertisements in an adsence block on one of my pages were trying to display a file called ""<code>/pagead/badge/checkout_999999.gif</code>"" from my server. I did a bit of investigating and found out that the companies behind these adverts use Google Checkout and ""<code>checkout_999999.gif</code>"" is supposed to be a tiny shopping kart icon with a tooltip which reads ""This site accepts Google Checkout"".</p>

<p>My problem is that ""<code>/pagead/badge/checkout_999999.gif</code>"" doesn't exist on my server. What do you do to handle this on your website? e.g:</p>

<ol>
<li>Save the logo (<img src=""https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/badge/checkout_999999.gif"" alt=""alt text"">) on your server in the place it is expected by Google?</li>
<li>Use a mod_rewrite rule to redirect the request? To where though?</li>
<li>Find a adsense option to turn off Google checkout enabled adverts? (I looked but couldn't see one?)</li>
<li>Ignore the issue and get on with something important</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><em>Back-story - <strong>please ignore unless very bored:</em></strong> Page 2 of the <a href=""http://www.peopleperhour.com/find.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">search page</a> on our site suddenly stopped working and I didn't know why. It turned out to be related to Google adsense. We use PHP session variables to save search criteria over different pages which worked fine for a while but then randomly stopped working. <em>Random bugs are the worst!</em> I was trying to work out what else is random on the page and decided that the Google ads were the only other random thing. Sure enough, sometimes a particular advert seemed to clear the session variables and break the search. What was actually happening was that the advert was requesting a image from our server (""<code>checkout_999999.gif</code>"") which didn't exist and Apache was behind-the-scenes redirecting to the site homepage which unfortunately clears the session variables needed for the search - hence the non-obvious breakage. I'm a bit worried that Google ads can request random files from my sever? I'd prefer if they could only use absolute URL's if they want to include logo's or other media.</p>

"966490","<p>My application has a very simple model right now and I'm trying to find the best way to traverse through an aggregate. As you can see in my model diagram at the bottom, I have an account, a trip and a list of people attending a trip.

<pre><code>    public List&lt;Trip&gt; GetAllTripsFor(int accountid)
    {
        var tripRepository = new TripRepository();
        var trips = tripRepository.FindAll();
        var userTrips = new List&lt;Trip&gt;();

        foreach (Trip trip in trips)
        {
            foreach (TripPeople person in trip.People)
            {
                // If this trip's person list contains this accountid
                // then add this trip to the userTrips list.
                if(person.Account.Id == accountid)
                    userTrips.Add(trip);
            }
        }

        return userTrips;

I think I figured out last night what I was trying to achieve. I'm not totally sure it's the best way but it is working good so far. I was able to come up with an interface like the following:</p>

<pre><code>//Return a list of trips for the user
var user = accountRepository.GetUserBy(123);
var userTrips = user.Trips;

//Return all of the users attending a trip
var peopleAttendingTrip = tripRepository.GetTripBy(234).People;

//Check user's status for a trip. A user must pay some kind of deposit
//before they are considered active.
var userStatus = userTrips.SingleOrDefault().GetStatusFor(user);
</code></pre>

<p>To achieve this I created a many-to-many table that holds the the primary keys from User and Trip and then mapped the relationship in NHibernate to the User Class and Trip Class. Also to achieve the user's status for a trip, I created an Entity that stores the user's state along with the trip and user info. That's a little duplication of data it seems like but I like the way it currently works and looks.</p>

<p>If you guys have any comments or a better way to implement this let me know. I'm always up for improving something! Thanks again</p>

"970504","<p>Can anyone post or point me in the direction of a clear example of a <strong>from scratch</strong> implementation of Model 2 architecture?</p>

<p>Below is a detailed description of Model 2, taken from <a href=""http://www.java-samples.com/showtutorial.php?tutorialid=350"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this page</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Model 2 architecture for designing JSP pages is in reality, Model View Controller (MVC) applied to web applications. Hence the two terms can be used interchangeably in the web world. MVC originated in SmallTalk and has since made its way into Java community. Model 2 architecure and its derivatives are the cornerstones for all serious and industrial strength web applications designed 
  in the real world. Hence it is essential for you understand this paradigm thoroughly. Figure 1.2 shows the Model 2 (MVC) architecture. </p>
  
  <p>The main difference between Model 1 and Model 2 is that in Model 2, a controller handles the user request instead of another JSP. The controller is implemented as a Servlet. The following steps are executed when the user submits the request. </p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>The Controller Servlet handles the user’s request. (This means the hyperlink in the JSP should point to the controller servlet). </li>
  <li>The Controller Servlet then instantiates appropriate JavaBeans based on the request parameters (and optionally also based on session attributes). </li>
  <li>The Controller Servlet then by itself or through a controller helper communicates with the middle tier or directly to the database to fetch the required data. </li>
  <li>The Controller sets the resultant JavaBeans (either same or a new one) in one of the following contexts – request, session or application. </li>
  <li>The controller then dispatches the request to the next view based on the request URL. </li>
  <li>The View uses the resultant JavaBeans from Step 4 to display data. Note that there is no presentation logic in the JSP. The sole function of the JSP in Model 2 architecture is to display the data from the JavaBeans set in the request, session or application scopes.

<p>A typical mod_deflate configuration may be excluding certain browsers based on user-agent strings, and may only be configured to compress certain file types - identified by their MIME type as registered on the server.</p>

<p>You should be compressing all of your HTML, CSS and Javascript files, but not your PNG, GIF or JPEG files, and there are bugs with Netscape 4 you may or may not want to account for.  Try using the <a href=""http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_deflate.html#recommended"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sample code from the documentation</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Location /&gt;
    # Insert filter
    SetOutputFilter DEFLATE

    # Netscape 4.x has some problems...
    BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4 gzip-only-text/html

    # Netscape 4.06-4.08 have some more problems
    BrowserMatch ^Mozilla/4\.0[678] no-gzip

    # MSIE masquerades as Netscape, but it is fine
    BrowserMatch \bMSIE !no-gzip !gzip-only-text/html

<p>Note too that the GIDZipTest GZIP test you posted does not test associated Javascript and CSS files, whereas YSlow does - in GIDZipTest GZIP test you'd need to test these individually.</p>

<p>I guess it is also possible that your ISP is using a caching proxy - transparent or not - which is mangling or removing your Accept-Encoding: header.  To rule this out as the cause you could get someone to test it from outside of your ISP.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is that when compressing files using gzip you are trading bandwidth for CPU time.  Above the lower compression strengths you will see diminishing returns in bandwidth savings, but huge increases in CPU time required.  Unfortunately with a compression strength as high as 9, you are almost certainly wasting too much CPU time for very little improved compression - I would always recommend using strength of 1.</p>

"977630","<p>I need to create a screen that is similar to the one below.  The only way I can come up with is to have a UIScrollView be the parent view.  Then have a UIImageView and UILabels for the thumbnail and main text (""All3Sports"").</p>

<p>For the sections like the phone numbers and home page, I thought I could have a UITableView and have it simply not scroll and ""grow"" vertically based on it's content.  I can't figure out how to do this.  I can set it to not scroll, but then content gets clipped.  If I set it not to clip then the scroll view still thinks it's a smaller size and doesn't scroll the content.</p>

<p>I'm open to ideas if there's a better approach to reproducing this screen.</p>

"978270","<p>This may or may not be a grey area subject, though my intentions are certainly not, so my intention is not to stir up an ethical debate on the topic of reverse engineering.  </p>

<p>I'm a type 1 diabetic currently undergoing pump therapy.  I'm an <a href=""http://myomnipod.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OmniPod</a> user, it's a disposable pod that adheres to my body and dispenses insulin for 3 days.  It's controlled by a personal diabetes manager [PDM] (seen below) which controls how much insulin to dispense during meals, bloor sugar readings, and it contains a food index for carb counting on the go.</p>

<sub>(source: <a href=""http://www.myomnipod.com/images/pdm-200.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">myomnipod.com</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>The new PDM has a USB port for the downloading of data.  The software is free for Windows users (a package called CoPilot), but there is no Mac support.</p>

<p>Upon plugging the PDM into my Mac, it mounted like any other USB device would and presented me with a readable volume with a single file on it with an IBF extension.  It weighs in at 16KB.</p>

<p>My first instinct was to pass it through a text editor and was presented with a very binary looking file.  I then passed it through strings (see below) and opened it up with a hex editor.  Though I couldn't gain much information aside from the strings below; no compression format details or anything. </p>

<pre><code>$ strings omnipoddata.ibf 
Insulet

<p>What should be my next step in this process?  I'm a dynamic language guy, so any resources for Ruby would be great, or Python.  Are there any test driven reverse engineering processes?</p>

<p>As far as the data I'm looking to obtain, it's information I would like to chart to gain more information on my progress (insulin intake, blood sugar readings, timestamps); all of which is possible in the Windows software package.</p>

<li>Floating-point (of various sizes)</li>
<li>Fixed point or some other strange format</li>
</ul>

<p>You have the advantage of knowing some numbers that are going to be in there, since you can see the data on the screen. So I'd look for those numbers in the file (in the various formats above). This should give you some data, at minimum.</p>

<p>Next, you mention timestamps. Timestamps are usually pretty easy, because they're invariably 32-bit unsigned ints, and you have a good ballpark range (time() +/- a few 100,000). So look for ints near there.</p>

<p>You can do all this by hand with a hex editor or write a little script. Once you start getting some data out, look for patterns. This should help a lot with finding more interesting fields. Good luck!</p>

<p>I don't want to use jQuery, I want to develop this code in pure JavaScript.</p>
","How to create a DIV style switcher?","<javascript><html><css>","2009-06-12 07:32:40","910","985483","5","<p>Inspecting the source code and how it changes as you change themes, it is really quite simple. Digg is harnessing the awesomeness of CSS to drastically change content by simply changing the class of an element. All you have to do is this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""theme_viewer""&gt;
&lt;!-- HTML code for your widget/thing to be styled --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then you can have your themes:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""return switchTheme('theme1');""&gt;theme 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""return switchTheme('theme2');""&gt;theme 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""return switchTheme('theme3');""&gt;theme 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" onclick=""return switchTheme('theme4');""&gt;theme 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>All <code>switchTheme</code> needs to then do is change the class of <code>theme_viewer</code> to the class passed:</p>

<pre><code>function switchTheme(theclass) {
    var viewer = document.getElementById('theme_viewer');
    viewer.className = theclass;
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your CSS stylesheets can then do whatever the different styles call for:</p>

<pre><code>#theme_viewer.theme1 {
    background-color: red;
}

#theme_viewer.theme2 {
    background-color: blue;
}

#theme_viewer.theme3 {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
}

#theme_viewer.theme4 {
    background-color: orange;
}
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://jsbin.com/opoji"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here is an example of this at work</a></p>

<p>As mentioned in the comments by J-P and in edeverett's answer, it is not a good idea to have your events inline as I have them in this example (ie, with the <code>onclick</code> attribute). I did it for simplicity, but it's not a good idea. The better idea is to wait for your document to load and attach the event handlers dynamically with Javascript. This is known as unobtrusive Javascript, and it is a Good Thing<sup>TM</sup>.</p>

<p>An example of the above example following good practices would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id='theme_options'&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" id='theme1'&gt;theme 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" id='theme2'&gt;theme 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" id='theme3'&gt;theme 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" id='theme4'&gt;theme 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then we use this cross browser addEvent function (<a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/flexible-javascript-events"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">written by</a> John Resig, author of jQuery):</p>

<pre><code>function addEvent( obj, type, fn ) {
  if ( obj.attachEvent ) {
    obj['e'+type+fn] = fn;
    obj[type+fn] = function(){obj['e'+type+fn]( window.event );}
    obj.attachEvent( 'on'+type, obj[type+fn] );
  } else
    obj.addEventListener( type, fn, false );
}

"987028","<p>I'm kind of lost, I try to deploy my application on a shared dreamhost server.
Now everything works fine locally. It's my first try at Rails, and I'm not really a programmer or sysadmin, just hacking something together.</p>

<p>So what do I have to do to make it run?</p>

<p>But I can't find any dispatch file in my rails app (2.3.2).</p>

<p>Do I have to create that one manually? Doesn't really feeld very rails-like to me. I didn't really manage to find out what this dispatch file does, and why it's needed.</p>

<p><strong>Dreamhost Support Answer</strong>:</p>

<p>The server was up to date, so that wasn't the problem.
They proposed freezing the Gems, which I did (see:  <a href=""http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Freezing_Gems"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Freezing_Gems</a>)
But it didn't help.
I guess I'm giving up, and looking into hosting which is specialized for rails.</p>

<p>Thx for all your help!</p>

<p><strong>Changed to hostingrails.com</strong></p>

<p>I got the app working on hostingrails.com, passenger on hostingrails.com showed me errors, which weren't shown by dreamhost or mongrel. By correcting these errors, I got the app working.</p>

You can either use FastCGI or Passenger to host Rails on shared DH (mongrel is an option if you upgrade to DreamhostPS, but that's obviously more expensive).</p>

<p>For FastCGI, you <strong>will</strong> need a dispatch.fcgi file (older versions of Rails would generate one when you created a new Rails app, but that stopped around 2.2 if I remember correctly) as well as code in your .htaccess to send requests to the dispatcher. See the Dreamhost <a href=""http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Ruby_on_Rails"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ruby on Rails</a> wiki page for details about setting up FastCGI.</p>

<p>The more preferable option is to set up your application to run on Phusion Passenger (aka mod_rails). It should be pretty simple through your Dreamhost panel, you just need to enable the domain to use mod_rails, and then set the directory for the domain to the public directory of your application.

"990890","<p>I search for the fastest or simplest method to compute the outer angle at any point of a convex polygon. That means, always the bigger angle, whereas the two angles in question add up to 360 degrees.</p>

<p>Now I know that I may compute the angles between the two vectors A-B and C-B which involves the dot product, normalization and cosine. Then I would still have to determine which of the two resulting angles (second one is 180 degrees minus first one) I want to take two times added to the other one.</p>

<p>However, I thought there might be a much simpler, less tricky solution, probably using the mighty atan2() function. I got stuck and ask you about this :-)</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> 
I was asked what I need the angle for. I need to calculate the area of this specific circle around B, but only of the polygon that is described by A, B, C, ...
So to calculate the area, I need the angle to use the formula <code>0.5*angle*r*r</code>.</p>

<p>Taking <code>.</code> to be the dot product we have</p>

<p>When a user uploads an image get the dimensions of it, then work out which is greater, the height or the width.</p>

<p>Then take the greatest measurement and get the ratio of that measurement to your target measurement, then use that ratio to scale both the height and width.</p>

<p>So if the user uploads a picture of 500 height and 450 width, as the height is greatest you'd divide 100 by 500, your thumbnail size. This gives us .2 as the ratio. which means the width will become 90, so you would shrink to 100x90, and no distortion would occur.</p>

"993922","<p>I'm working on a pong game for the Nintendo DS. I'm using libnds to set things up and I've come across a very strange behaviour. So far I've only tried it out in emulators, but I use three different ones and they all exhibit this behaviour so I suspect I'm doing something bad.</p>

<p>The actual problem is that when I use background layer 1 or above for my tiled graphics, I get weird stripes all over that layer. If I use background layer 0 the problem goes away, but since that is rendered last, I cannot actually draw over it in another layer, which I want to.</p>

<p>My setup code:</p>

<pre><code>void pong::setup_engine()
{
    // Setup DS graphics engine.
    // -------------------------
    videoSetMode(MODE_5_2D | DISPLAY_BG0_ACTIVE | DISPLAY_BG1_ACTIVE | DISPLAY_BG2_ACTIVE);
    vramSetBankA(VRAM_A_MAIN_BG_0x06000000);
    vramSetBankB(VRAM_B_MAIN_BG_0x06020000);

    u8 *tileMemory = reinterpret_cast&lt;u8 *&gt;(BG_TILE_RAM(1));
    u16 *mapMemory = reinterpret_cast&lt;u16 *&gt;(BG_MAP_RAM(0));

    int bg0 = bgInit(1, BgType_Text8bpp, BgSize_T_256x256, 0, 1);
    int bg1 = bgInit(2, BgType_Bmp16, BgSize_B16_256x256, 0, 0);
    //bgScroll(bg0, 256, 256);

    u16 *ptr = bgGetGfxPtr(bg1);
    for (int y = 10; y &lt; 128*60; y++)
    {
        ptr[y] = 0xFFFF;
    }

    BG_PALETTE[1] = grey0;
    BG_PALETTE[2] = grey1;
    BG_PALETTE[3] = grey2;
    BG_PALETTE[4] = grey3;
    BG_PALETTE[5] = grey4;
    BG_PALETTE[6] = grey5;
    BG_PALETTE[7] = grey6;

    // 32 here is not 32 bytes but 32 half-words, which is 64 bytes.
    swiCopy(CORNER_TILE, tileMemory, 32);
    swiCopy(TOP_TILE, tileMemory + 64, 32);
    swiCopy(SIDE_TILE, tileMemory + (64 * 2), 32);
    swiCopy(MAIN_TILE, tileMemory + (64 * 3), 32);

    swiCopy(MAP, mapMemory, 32*24);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the above code I use layer 1 for bg0, which is my tiled graphics layer. This makes the weird stripes appear; if I were to change it to 0 like this, it would show up as expected:</p>

<pre><code>int bg0 = bgInit(0, BgType_Text8bpp, BgSize_T_256x256, 0, 1);
</code></pre>

<p>You can change the priorities around at will, layer 0 is not necessarily on top of 1, etc.  Look at the BGxCNT registers (BG0CNT, BG1CNT,...) and the priority bits.  Now if the priority is a tie then yes the layer number determines who wins.</p>

Each node holds the fields string ""name"" and ""list"" that contains the next nodes.</p>

<p>How can I create lists of all possible node names from the head node to the foot node?
each list is to hold a path from head to foot. the number of nodes from head to foot is always the same i.e: 6.</p>

When the node has no more children, dump the path. Note that you have a graph/forest instead of a tree, but the algorithm I outlined will work just the same. </p>

<p>To start you off using a BFS:</p>

<pre><code>Step 1. [n1]
Step 2. [n2(n1), n3(n1)]
Step 3. [n3(n1), n4(n1,n2)]
Step 4. [n4(n1, n2), n4(n1, n3)]
Step 5. [n4(n1, n3), n5(n1, n2, n4), n6(n1, n2, n4), n10(n1, n2, n4)]

<p>You won't be able to properly use the WPF Ribbon control (to its full extent at least) until .NET 4.0 is released. I'm not sure whether it's included in the current Beta 1, but it should (almost) definitely be part of the core WPF library in the final release. This ought to be much more stable and complete in terms of features. Whether the feature set will match that of the Microsoft Office Ribbon is another question - doubtful, in my mind, though you might expect WPF by nature to provide some sort of extensibility.</p>

"1002519","<p>While converting a webdesign given as a photoshop file to html+css, I got confused with font sizes. As seen on the image below, 30 px in photoshop does not equal 30 px in other Windows programs (different on Mac or others?), or browsers. This seems to be unaffected by creating the photoshop image in different resolutions than 72 which is default, and unaffected by change of units between pt and px. Can anyone hint on how to set photoshop to use browser px units?

<p>EDIT: So the answer turned out to be quite simple. You see what I failed to mention above was that there <em>was</em> indeed output... but that it was just a number (eg: 52). Turns out this was the ID for that custom attribute value (It was a Dropdown type of custom attribute).</p>

<p>So in summary<br>
This works for custom attributes of type text:</p>

<pre><code>echo $this-&gt;htmlEscape($_item-&gt;getYearmade())
</code></pre>

<p>But for all other types of custom attribute (I think), the following should be used:</p>

<pre><code>echo $this-&gt;htmlEscape($_item-&gt;getAttributeText('yearmade'))

<pre><code>print('&lt;pre&gt;');print_r($_product-&gt;getData());print('&lt;/pre&gt;');

<p>You should see output that looks something like the following.</p>

<p>So, you can grab an array of properties and just pull the key out. You could also use Magento's convenience/magic getX and setX methods.  On all Magento models, you can access any property in the data array by calling a method based on the camel case version of the name,</p>

<pre><code>$created_at = $_product-&gt;getCreatedAt();
$_product-&gt;setCreatedAt($date);

<p>So, whatever your custom attribute name is, you should be able to get at it using the above, and if you're not sure just print_r or var_dump the contents of the array returned by getData(). </p>

<p>Finally, if the custom attribute is on one of the related products simple product, you'll wants something more like</p>

"1010617","<p>I am currently hoping to use a PropertyGrid to allow users to edit some of my classes, however I've hit a wall with passing objects to the UITypeEditor(s) they use. When the user presses the drop down I want to show a listbox of already loaded textures to choose from, if they want to use a texture the application hasn't loaded yet they can click a button to choose one from a file dialog. In case I make no sense here a mock of the form:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/6mhTZ.png"" alt=""Dropdown Image"">.</p>

<p><strong>My problem:</strong> To fill the listbox I need access to the class that manages the list of resources from the UITypeEditor.</p>

<p>Now I've solved this problem for my own classes by giving them a reference on creation to their managing object. In the UITypeEditor I then use that reference to access what I need. However I can't do this for classes I haven't written, such as the XNA Texture2D class.</p>

<p>Here are what the classes I'm using look like:</p>

<pre><code>class StaticGeometryChunk
{
    // Geometry data to draw with. Contains a reference to its managing 
    // class for use in its UITypeEditor.
    public GeometryData { get; set; }
    ....
}

class Material
{
    // These are XNA classes. I can't just add a reference to its managing 
    // class (I think?).
    public Texture2D Texture1 { get; set; }
    public Texture2D Texture2 { get; set; }
    ....
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've been looking at my options and they seem to be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make the managing classes static.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't really want to do this. There are several managing classes as each resource is loaded differently. There are also classes that need to be created before these and are passed in.</p>

<ol start=""2"">
<li>Make the managing classes singletons.</li>
</ol>

<p>I don't really want to do this either. It seems like a quick and dirty way to ""hide"" the problem instead of ""solve"" it. I also might want the option of having several managing classes in the future which the singletons eliminate.</p>

<ol start=""3"">
<li>Create a wrapper class which holds the reference to a managing class and its target (such as the XNA Texture2D).</li>
</ol>

<p>This is currently what I'm thinking of doing. Its would be quite simple and quick to do but something about it nags me but I don't know what.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on the above or other methods to pass what I need into the UITypeEditor?</p>

While he describes the over-optimistic market expectations and the dramatic financial outcome of the idea, he doesn't go into the technical details of this epic fail. I had my chance to work with Itanium for some period of time and I personally loved its architecture, it was so clear and simple and straightforward in comparison to the modern x86 processors architecture...</p>

<p>So then what are/were the technical reasons of its failure? Under-performance? Incompatibility with x86 code? Complexity of compilers? Why did this ""Itanic"" sink?</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Itanium.png"" alt=""Itanium processor block""></p>
","What are the technical reasons behind the ""Itanium fiasco"", if any?","<hardware><itanium>","2009-06-18 09:36:38","9630","13825154","6","<p>Itanium failed because VLIW for today's workloads is simply an awful idea.</p>

<p>Donald Knuth, a widely respected computer scientist, <a href=""http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1193856"" rel=""noreferrer"">said in a 2008 interview</a> that ""<em>the ""Itanium"" approach [was] supposed to be so terrific—until it turned out that the wished-for compilers were basically impossible to write.</em>""<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>That pretty much nails the problem.</p>

<p>For scientific computation, where you get at least a few dozens of instructions per basic block, VLIW probably works fine. There's enough instructions there to create good bundles. For more modern workloads, where oftentimes you get about 6-7 instructions per basic block, it simply doesn't (that's the average, IIRC, for SPEC2000). The compiler simply can't find independent instructions to put in the bundles.</p>

<p>Modern x86 processors, with the exception of Intel Atom (pre Silvermont) and I believe AMD E-3**/4**, are all out-of-order processors. They maintain a dynamic instruction window of roughly 100 instructions, and within that window they execute instructions whenever their inputs become ready. If multiple instructions are ready to go and they don't compete for resources, they go together in the same cycle. </p>

<p>So how is this different from VLIW? The first key difference between VLIW and out-of-order is that the the out-of-order processor can choose instructions from different basic blocks to execute at the same time. Those instructions are executed speculatively anyway (based on branch prediction, primarily). The second key difference is that out-of-order processors determine these schedules dynamically (i.e., each dynamic instruction is scheduled independently; the VLIW compiler operates on static instructions).</p>

<p>The third key difference is that implementations of out-of-order processors can be as wide as wanted, without changing the instruction set (Intel Core has 5 execution ports, other processors have 4, etc).  VLIW machines <em>can</em> and do execute multiple bundles at once (if they don't conflict).  For example, <a href=""https://www.realworldtech.com/ev8-mckinley/5/"" rel=""noreferrer"">early Itanium CPUs execute up to 2 VLIW bundles per clock cycle, 6 instructions</a>, with later designs (<a href=""https://www.realworldtech.com/poulson-preview/"" rel=""noreferrer"">2011's Poulson and later</a>) running up to 4 bundles = 12 instructions per clock, with SMT to take those instructions from multiple threads.  In that respect, real Itanium hardware is like a traditional in-order superscalar design (like P5 Pentium or Atom), but with more / better ways for the compiler to expose instruction-level parallelism to the hardware (in theory, if it can find enough, which is the problem).</p>

<p>Performance-wise with similar specs (caches, cores, etc) they just beat the crap out of Itanium.</p>

<p>So why would one buy an Itanium now? Well, the only reason really is HP-UX. If you want to run HP-UX, that's the way to do it...</p>

<p>Many compiler writers don't see it this way - they always liked the fact that Itanium gives them more to do, puts them back in control, etc. But they won't admit how miserably it failed. </p>

<hr>

<p>Footnote 1:</p>

<p>This was part of a response about the value of multi-core processors.  Knuth was saying parallel processing is hard to take advantage of; finding and exposing fine-grained instruction-level parallelism (and explicit speculation: EPIC) at compile time for a VLIW is also a hard problem, and somewhat related to finding coarse-grained parallelism to split a sequential program or function into multiple threads to automatically take advantage of multiple cores.</p>

<p>11 years later he's still basically right: per-thread performance is still very important for most non-server software, and something that CPU vendors focus on because many cores is no substitute.</p>

"1012519","<p>The scenario is I am changing the status of a ""request"" and sometimes the new status is transitory and needs to immediately change to another status. So I'm in a method in my base class, WorkflowCommandBase:</p>

<p>The last line tries to execute the method again for the new status (from the inherited class, calledType), but the method I am calling doesn't exist in calledType, it is implemented here in the base. It is possible to do this? Or do I need to override the Execute method in the inherited classes when this situation exists?</p>

{
    if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(commandName))
    {
        return Request;
    }

    Type calledType = Type.GetType(commandName);
    return (Request)calledType.InvokeMember(
           ""Execute"",

 | BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.FlattenHierarchy

<p>This seems the most likely problem because you say that it isn't finding the method, but this flag is only effective if you are searching for a static member.</p>
<p>On the other hand if the method <em>isn't</em> static then the binding flags that you have are correct, but you'll need an instance of the type to run it against.

    }

<p>Where &quot;Face()&quot; returns a C string containing the font name, &quot;PointSize()&quot; returns an integer containing the point size I want etc etc. I'm retreiving this values with this code:</p>
<pre><code>Str255 Name;
SInt16 Size;
Style St;
OSStatus e = GetThemeFont(  kThemeSmallSystemFont,
                            smSystemScript,
                            Name,

if (e) printf(&quot;%s:%i - GetThemeFont failed with %i\n&quot;, __FILE__, __LINE__, e);
else
{
    Info.Face(p2c(Name));
    Info.PointSize(Size);
    Status = true;
}
</code></pre>
<p>And it returns valid looking face/pointsize info, and in fact the font looks correct apart from it looking bolder than other apps. It might not look like a big difference but when your entire app is full of text it gets to be obvious. And my flagship product is an email client... hence lots of text.</p>
<p>The drawing code that creates the layouts and eventually calls ATSUDrawText is quite long, and I'm not sure it's causing the issue.. I think it's more style related... but if need by I'll post a link to that source later.</p>
<p>Can anyone help getting my fonts looking less bold?</p>

Obviously I'm using ATSUFindFontFromName which appears to be totally reasonable, however it looks different to the rest of the operating system. The correct drop in replacement code is:</p>

<pre><code>CFStringRef fontName = CFStringCreateWithBytes( kCFAllocatorDefault,

<p>My website is going to have a main wrapper that is set to a max-width property for compatible browsers. It will stretch to 940px across at max. When scaled down I would like the swf to scale proportionately with it. Like an image with width percent applied. The flash movie has the dimensions of 940 × 360 pixels.</p>

<p>I can't seem to figure out the correct attributes to add to the embed tag to get it to do this.</p>

<p>I am currently using jquery flash embed, but am open to other options, though this is my ideal.</p>

<p>In the example I have set the flash background to black. </p>

<p>When resize the browser window the flash movie doesn't scale proportionately to the div, only the photo does, leaving a blank canvas (black), while the div height stays the same. I can't add a height value in the CSS.</p>

There was too much flicker and I am not familiar enough with actionscript to know how to fix it. Big props for putting that much together though.</p>

<p><strong>I created a solution using jquery. It's very simple.</strong></p>

<p>First I embed the flash movie with the max possible height, for folks with css disabled. It will still scale with the width but will show canvas background like in the linked examples.</p>

<pre><code>$(selector).flash({
    src: swf,
    width: '100%',
    height: '360',
});

//get ratio from native width and height
var nativeWidth = 940;
var nativeHeight = 360;
var ratio = nativeWidth/nativeHeight;

var containerWidth = $(selector).width();
var containerHeight = containerWidth/ratio;
$(selector+' embed').height(containerHeight);

//resize flash movie
$(window).resize(function() {
    containerWidth = $(selector).width();
    containerHeight = containerWidth/ratio;
    $(selector+' embed', selector+' object').height(containerHeight);
    $(selector).height(containerHeight);
});
</code></pre>

<p>Then pretty much resize the movie as the browser window is resized and calculate the height from the new width divided by the original aspect ratio. This code could be cleaned up a lot, but I hope it helps someone else avoid hours of annoyance.</p>

"1031135","<p>I recently used NDepend and it produced a good report on my .net assemblies and related pdbs.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing I found in the report was abstractness vs. instability graph. I wanted to understand this in real detail, I read their docs and online metrices but it could only help to an extent.</p>

<p>Primarily I wish to understand how to evaluate the graph correctly and techniques to control abstractness with stability.</p>

<p>There's a very good article <a href=""http://www.igloocoder.com/archive/2007/07/25/1277.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a> that talks on this but what more in addition to this I need is 'how do I control this ? [controlling abstractness with stability]'</p>

Higher the abstraction, lower the rigidity (or greater the flexibility) and vice versa. If the components of the system depend on abstract classes or interfaces such a system is easier to extend and change than if it depended directly on concrete classes.</p>
<p>Stability is a measure of tolerance to change as in how well the software system allows changes to it without breaking it. This is determined by analyzing the interdependencies of the components of the system.</p>
<p>Robert C. Martin's <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20110313234819/http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/oodmetrc.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> on OO metrics describes these concepts in more quantitative terms.</p>
<p>Excerpt from the article:</p>
<p>The responsibility, independence and stability of a category can be measured by counting the
dependencies that interact with that category. Three metrics have been identified:</p>
<p><em><strong>Ca : Afferent Couplings : The number of classes outside this category that depend upon classes within this category.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Ce : Efferent Couplings : The number of classes inside this category that depend upon classes outside this categories.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>I : Instability : (Ce ÷ (Ca+Ce)) : This metric has the range [0,1]. I=0 indicates a maximally stable category. I=1 indicates a maximally instable category.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>A : Abstractness : (# abstract classes in category ÷ total # of classes in category). This metric range is [0,1]. 0 means concrete and 1 means completely abstract.</strong></em></p>
<p>In any software system particularly large ones, balance is critical. In this case, a system should balance abstractness with stability in order to be &quot;good&quot;. The position on the A-I graph shows this. Please read the article for the explanation.</p>

        iv[i] = 0;

    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""DES/CBC/PKCS5Padding"");

For each group of samples mapped to a single pixel, you could draw a (vertical) line segment from the minimum value in the sample group to the maximum value. If you zoom in to 1 sample per pixel or less, this doesn't work anymore, and the 'nice' solution would be to display the sinc interpolated values.
Because DrawLine cannot paint a single pixel, there is a small problem when the minimum and maximum are the same. In that case you could copy a single pixel image in the desired position, as in the code below:</p>

<pre><code>double samplesPerPixel = (double)L / _width;
double firstSample = 0;

"1045257","<p>I have a generated (via MSBuild) Web.config that runs prior to the Build target whose content includes, among other things, &lt;compilation debug=""true""&gt;. The generated Web.config is copied to the root and put in the Content item group. But when I run the Debug build in Visual Studio 2008 (via F5) I get the following dialog:</p>

<p><img src=""https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2450/3659821355_cc668c62ca.jpg"" alt=""Debugging Not Enabled""></p>

<p>If I select ""Add ..."" and click OK it appears to add the generated Web.config to the project and it shows up in the IDE as a project file. So maybe the question should be: Why does the Web.config file need to be a part of the project?</p>

<p>I'd really like to avoid including generated config files in the project because of source control. If the Web.config file is there when the application runs I don't see why Visual Studio should be concerned. So is there a way for Visual Studio to accept a generated Web.config without it being added through the IDE?</p>
","Why does Visual Studio 2008 ask about enabling debugging when debugging is already enabled?","<asp.net><visual-studio-2008><msbuild><debugging><web-config>","2009-06-25 17:39:56","443","1051725","1","<p>Turns out Visual Studio requires the Web.config to part of the project, no ifs, ands or buts. This <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms178726.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSDN article</a> seems to imply it anyway.</p>

<p>To get around this I had to create a Web.config in the root, remove everything in the &lt;configuration&gt; element effectively leaving it empty and add it to the project. Then in one of my custom build targets, backup the empty Web.config and copy the generated Web.config to the root. In addition to that, my custom clean target restores the backed-up Web.config. With the above steps source control and Visual Studio are oblivious to my slight of hand.</p>

"1045503","<p>I have a list of <code>Customer</code> objects that I need to have selectable from a JComboBox.  From what I read I need to implement a custom renderer to have the fields I want displayed in the list.</p>

|  Customer #5 Name - Contact - City, State    |

<p>public class CustomerListCellRenderer extends DefaultListCellRenderer {</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public Component getListCellRendererComponent(
        JList list, Object value, int index, boolean isSelected, boolean cellHasFocus) {
    super.getListCellRendererComponent(list, value, index, isSelected, cellHasFocus);
    if (value instanceof Customer) {
        Customer c = (Customer) value;

        StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer();

        setText(sb.toString());

  }

<p>This doesn't work correctly under Solaris / Unix / Linux using the system GTKLookAndFeel.  The background of the input area of the combobox is not drawn and no border is drawn around it.  (See screenshot below).  Is there another way to achieve this that will work correctly across the 3 major platforms (Win/Mac/GTK)?  Can I do a converter to do this and only manipulate the data not the GUI?</p>

<p>My current workaround is to override toString() on my Customer object to display each record in the format I want, but looking for other ideas.</p>

"1046370","<p>One last question about Client Profile installation. I downloaded the Microsoft .NET Framework Client Profile Online Installer because we want to put it in the installation CD because our end user might not have either .net framework 3.5 or internet. So we want to be able to handle both cases.</p>

<p>In the prerequisites I'm able to select the location of where the file will be, but I don't know where it should be. I want to be able to somehow put the path of the cd, something like d:\ProductName\Prerequisites\DotNetFx35ClientSetup.exe so it can get it and install it from there. Does anyone have an idea of how this can be achieved?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Here's the prerequisites window:</p>

","Client Profile Application prerequisites","<installation>","2009-06-25 21:33:11","2110","1050337","2","<p>Ok, here's the thing. I tried with the Client Profile but it didn't work, I think it's because the Client Profile Installer does not have the features of .net framework 3.5 <strong>SP1</strong>. So in the installation process it ask for .net framework 3.5 SP1 too, so I had to make that available offline too. Here's the deal:</p>

<ul>
<li>First you need to download the <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=992cffcb-f8ce-41d9-8bd6-31f3e216285c&amp;displaylang=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Client Profile Offline Installer</a></li>
<li>Then you need to copy the file into the following folder:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Bootstrapper\Packages\DotNetFx35Client</li>
<li>Once that's done, you can deploy your Setup Project and it will compile (This is only for Client Profile installation).</li>
</ul>

<p>Since in my case it complained and asked for .net Framework 3.5 SP1, this is what I had to do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enable .net Framework 3.5 SP1 prerequisite in your Setup solution</li>
<li>Download <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=D0E5DEA7-AC26-4AD7-B68C-FE5076BBA986&amp;displaylang=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">.net Framework 3.5 SP1 Full Package</a></li>
<li>Put in the the C:\ drive (for fast access) and go to command prompt and type:
C:\dotNetFx35Setup.exe /x</li>
<li>Extract everything anywhere you want, this will create a folder called wcu</li>
<li>go to wcu\dotNetFramework, take all the files and folders and copy them to
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.0A\Bootstrapper\Packages\DotNetFX35</li>
</ul>

<p>Now build your solution and it should work. You will get 2 warnings though. These are a know issue and according to Microsoft they don't interfere in the installation process of your application. <a href=""http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/winformssetup/thread/0f33fe2b-cc66-4cfa-a07f-84a97d7bcb29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Read this</a> for more information.</p>

<p>This was a little tedious for me to find and come up with, so I really hope this can help anyone else with this problem. If you have any question post a comment and I'll get back to you ASAP.</p>

<p>I'm looking for a solution other than ""use a different browser!!1"" as I don't have any control over that. Any help will be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> I added that button event to a loop and this is what happens (the sudden drop off is when I terminate IE):
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/6pmp5.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> I filed a <a href=""http://dev.jqueryui.com/ticket/4644"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bug report</a> (fingers crossed).</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> This is also on the <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-dev/browse_thread/thread/861282378f94a37e"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mailing list</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update 4:</strong>  This (as reported on the mailing list) doesn't work, and in fact makes things worse:</p>

<pre><code>$(window).bind(""unload"", function() {
  $('.hasDatepicker').datepicker('destroy');
  $(window).unbind();
}); 
</code></pre>

<p>It's not enough to just call destroy. I'm still stranded with this one and getting very close to ripping jquery out of the project. I love it (I really do!) but if it's broken, I can't use it.</p>

<p><strong>Update 5:</strong> Starting the bounty, another 550 points to one helpful individual!</p>

<p><strong>Update 6:</strong> Some more testing has shown that this leak exists in IE6 and IE6sp1, but has been fixed in IE6sp2+. Now, about the answers I have so far...</p>

<p>So far all answers have been any one of these:</p>

<ol>
<li>Abandon IE6sp0/sp1 users or ignore
them</li>
<li>Debug jquery and fix the problem myself</li>
<li>I can't repro the problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>I know beggars can't be choosers, but those simply are not answers to my problem.</p>

<p>I cannot abandon my users. They make up 25% of the userbase. This is a custom app written for a customer, designed to work on IE6. <em>It is not an option to abandon IE6sp0/sp1.</em> It's not an option to tell my customers to just deal with it. It leaks so fast that after five minutes, some of the weaker machines are unusable.</p>

<p>Further, while I'd love to become a JS ninja so I can hunt down obscure memory leaks in jquery code (granted this is MS's fault, not jquery's), I don't see that happening either. </p>

<p>Finally, multiple people have reproduced the problem here and on the mailing list. If you can't repro it, you might have IE6SP2+, or you might not be refreshing enough.</p>

<p>Obviously this issue is very important to me (hence the 6 revisions, bounty, etc.) so I'm open to new ideas, but please keep in mind that none of those three suggestions will work for me.</p>

<p>Thanks to all for your consideration and insights. Please keep them coming!</p>

<p><strong>Update 7:</strong> The bounty has ended and Keith's answer was auto-accepted by SO. I'm sorry that only half the points were awarded (since I didn't select the answer myself), but I'm still really stuck so I think half is fair. </p>

<p>I am hopeful that the jquery/jquery-ui team can fix this problem but I'm afraid that I'll have to write this off as ""impossible (for now)"" and stop using some or all of jquery. Thanks to everyone for your help and consideration. If someone comes along with a real solution to my problem, please post and I'll figure out some way to reward you.</p>

<p>The consequences of not fixing this is that IE6 users will notice their machine getting slower and slower and ultimately either crashing completely or more likely crashing IE6.</p>

<p>So what?</p>

<p>Really - <em>why is this your problem?</em></p>

<p>Yours definitely won't be the only site they visit with this leak, and they will see IE6 crash regularly regardless of what you do, because that's what it does. </p>

<p>It's unlikely that anyone still on IE6 could even point out your application as one that leaks. </p>

<p>Finally when IE6 does crash it reports IE6 as the culprit - you can legitimately point out that this is a bug in IE6 that Microsoft have fixed in a new release.</p>

<p>Your expensive time is better spent on improving the application for the users not trapped in legacy hell - your app should basically work for IE6 users, but this sort of issue can suck away all of your time and not fix their problem. IE6 is still going to be an unsupported, crash ridden, security hole of a browser.</p>

<p>I suspect the jQuery devs take a similar view to me. Also you have to do some really ugly stuff to get round this bug in IE6, including hacky DOM work that stops the leak but is actually much slower.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Ok, this isn't an easy problem to fix - MS describe the IE6 bug (and provide advice on how to fix it) here: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb250448(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb250448(VS.85).aspx</a></p>

<p>Basically this isn't a problem with javascript or jQuery - the actual issue is with the IE6 DOM - when HTML elements are added to the page (by javascript, rather than being in the page when it loads) IE can't garbage collect them unless they are created in a very specific way.</p>

<p>This is back to front from how jQuery UI builds elements (see DOM insertion order bug in the link above) and so this isn't something that either the jQuery devs or you can easily fix.</p>

<p>So how do you fix the issue? Well, you can stick with the legacy pop-up calendar for IE6 or you can write your own one. </p>

<p>I would recommend the former, but if you really want to built the latter there are some basic rules to follow:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Always add elements top-down - for instance if you want to built a table add the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element into the page's DOM, then add <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> then <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> and so on. This is back to front as it's much quicker to build the entire table and then add it to the DOM - unfortunately that's where IE6 loses track of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Only use CSS and HTML 3.2 attributes - sounds dumb, but IE6 creates extra objects to store the extra attributes (or 'expando' properties) and these also leak.</p></li>
<li><p>Kinda related to (2), but as @gradbot mentions IE6 has problems garbage collecting javascript variables - if they reference a DOM element inside an event fired from that element you can get problems. This is also compounded by javascript references to DOM elements that have 'expando' properties.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you have a look around online there may already be a drop-down DHTML calendar that sticks to these rules - it won't be as pretty, quick or configurable as the jQuery UI one, but I'm sure I've seen it done without leaking in IE6.</p>

<p>I think the best bet is to keep as much static as possible - for instance you could load the calendar grid (week numbers and day column headings) with the page and then dynamically load in the numbers (and nothing else). Create the day numbers as links, with javascript in the href - not best practice normally but far less likely to leak in IE6.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListView&gt;
    &lt;ListView.ItemContainerStyle&gt;
        &lt;Style TargetType=""ListViewItem""&gt;
            &lt;Setter Property=""Focusable"" Value=""false""/&gt;
        &lt;/Style&gt;
    &lt;/ListView.ItemContainerStyle&gt;
    ...
&lt;/ListView&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However if you still require the functionality of the ListView, like being able to select an item, then you can visually disable the styling of the selected item like so:</p>

<p>You can do this a number of ways, from changing the ListViewItem's <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms788717.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">ControlTemplate</a> to just setting a style (much easier).  You can create a style for the ListViewItems using the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.itemscontrol.itemcontainerstyle.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">ItemContainerStyle</a> and 'turn off' the background and border brush when it is selected.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListView&gt;
    &lt;ListView.ItemContainerStyle&gt;
        &lt;Style TargetType=""{x:Type ListViewItem}""&gt;
            &lt;Style.Triggers&gt;
                &lt;Trigger Property=""IsSelected""
                         Value=""True""&gt;
                    &lt;Setter Property=""Background""
                            Value=""{x:Null}"" /&gt;
                    &lt;Setter Property=""BorderBrush""
                            Value=""{x:Null}"" /&gt;

        &lt;/Style&gt;
    &lt;/ListView.ItemContainerStyle&gt;
    ...

<p>Also, unless you have some other way of notifying the user when the item is selected (or just for testing) you can add a column to represent the value:</p>

","Vertically align text to top within a UILabel","<ios><cocoa-touch><uikit><uilabel><text-alignment>","2009-06-28 08:54:03","771192","1054681","51","<p>There's no way to set the vertical-align on a <code>UILabel</code>, but you can get the same effect by changing the label's frame. I've made my labels orange so you can see clearly what's happening.</p>

<p>Here's the quick and easy way to do this:</p>

<pre><code>    [myLabel sizeToFit];
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/O7JEo.png"" alt=""sizeToFit to squeeze a label""></p>

<hr>

<p>If you have a label with longer text that will make more than one line, set <code>numberOfLines</code> to <code>0</code> (zero here means an unlimited number of lines).</p>

<pre><code>    myLabel.numberOfLines = 0;
    [myLabel sizeToFit];
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/08dRM.png"" alt=""Longer label text with sizeToFit""></p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Longer Version</strong></p>

<p>I'll make my label in code so that you can see what's going on. You can set up most of this in Interface Builder too. My setup is a View-Based App with a background image I made in Photoshop to show margins (20 points). The label is an attractive orange color so you can see what's going on with the dimensions.</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];

    // 20 point top and left margin. Sized to leave 20 pt at right.
    CGRect labelFrame = CGRectMake(20, 20, 280, 150);
    UILabel *myLabel = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:labelFrame];
    [myLabel setBackgroundColor:[UIColor orangeColor]];

    NSString *labelText = @""I am the very model of a modern Major-General, I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral"";
    [myLabel setText:labelText];

    // Tell the label to use an unlimited number of lines
    [myLabel setNumberOfLines:0];
    [myLabel sizeToFit];

    [self.view addSubview:myLabel];
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some limitations of using <code>sizeToFit</code> come into play with center- or right-aligned text. Here's what happens:</p>

<pre><code>    // myLabel.textAlignment = NSTextAlignmentRight;
    myLabel.textAlignment = NSTextAlignmentCenter;

    [myLabel setNumberOfLines:0];
    [myLabel sizeToFit];
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/DH18q.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The label is still sized with a fixed top-left corner. You can save the original label's width in a variable and set it after <code>sizeToFit</code>, or give it a fixed width to counter these problems:</p>

<pre><code>    myLabel.textAlignment = NSTextAlignmentCenter;

    [myLabel setNumberOfLines:0];
    [myLabel sizeToFit];

    CGRect myFrame = myLabel.frame;
    // Resize the frame's width to 280 (320 - margins)
    // width could also be myOriginalLabelFrame.size.width
    myFrame = CGRectMake(myFrame.origin.x, myFrame.origin.y, 280, myFrame.size.height);
    myLabel.frame = myFrame;
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/gedYP.png"" alt=""label alignment""></p>

<hr>

<p>Note that <code>sizeToFit</code> will respect your initial label's minimum width. If you start with a label 100 wide and call <code>sizeToFit</code> on it, it will give you back a (possibly very tall) label with 100 (or a little less) width. You might want to set your label to the minimum width you want before resizing.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/RGI6v.png"" alt=""Correct label alignment by resizing the frame width""></p>

<p>Some other things to note:</p>

<p>Whether <code>lineBreakMode</code> is respected depends on how it's set. <code>NSLineBreakByTruncatingTail</code> (the default) is ignored after <code>sizeToFit</code>, as are the other two truncation modes (head and middle). <code>NSLineBreakByClipping</code> is also ignored. <code>NSLineBreakByCharWrapping</code> works as usual. The frame width is still narrowed to fit to the rightmost letter.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/1709587/mark-amery"">Mark Amery</a> gave a fix for NIBs and Storyboards using Auto Layout in the comments:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If your label is included in a nib or storyboard as a subview of the <code>view</code> of a ViewController that uses autolayout, then putting your <code>sizeToFit</code> call into <code>viewDidLoad</code> won't work, because autolayout sizes and positions the subviews after <code>viewDidLoad</code> is called and will immediately undo the effects of your <code>sizeToFit</code> call. However, calling <code>sizeToFit</code> from within <code>viewDidLayoutSubviews</code> <em>will</em> work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><hr>
<strong>My Original Answer (for posterity/reference):</strong></p>

<p>This uses the <code>NSString</code> method <code>sizeWithFont:constrainedToSize:lineBreakMode:</code> to calculate the frame height needed to fit a string, then sets the origin and width.</p>

<p>Resize the frame for the label using the text you want to insert. That way you can accommodate any number of lines.</p>

<pre><code>CGSize maximumSize = CGSizeMake(300, 9999);
NSString *dateString = @""The date today is January 1st, 1999"";
UIFont *dateFont = [UIFont fontWithName:@""Helvetica"" size:14];
CGSize dateStringSize = [dateString sizeWithFont:dateFont 
        constrainedToSize:maximumSize 
        lineBreakMode:self.dateLabel.lineBreakMode];

CGRect dateFrame = CGRectMake(10, 10, 300, dateStringSize.height);

self.dateLabel.frame = dateFrame;
</code></pre>

While table and outline views support the idea of custom cells being displayed within them, they are not set up to easily support custom subviews. </p>

<p>So the trick becomes, how do you get a a complete NSProgressIndicator view to display and animate at the desired spot in your window, without the ability to actually install it in the table view row?</p>

<p>The trick I've used is to literally install the NSProgressIndicator as a subview of the outline or table view itself.  To find the location to add the subview, so it looks like it's ""in the row"", use the frameOfCellAtColumn:row: method. You can then position your progress indicator within that location of the outline view. When you're done spinning the progress indicator, you probably don't want to show it any more, so just remove it from its superview and discard it.</p>

<p>You will want to make sure you set the required autosizing flags on the progress indicator, so that it floats in the correct direction when/if your outline view is resized.</p>

<p>I'm sure there are other hacks like this to achieve the desired end result. I don't think there is any super-clean way to accomplish this trick.</p>

  <p>When asynchronous read operations

  <strong>each time</strong> the associated Process
  writes a line of text to its
  StandardOutput stream.</p>
  
  <p>You can cancel an asynchronous read
  operation by calling CancelOutputRead.
  The read operation can be canceled by
  the caller or by the event handler.
  After canceling, you can call
  BeginOutputReadLine again to resume
  asynchronous read operations.</p>

<p>That leads me to believe you should only call this method once and it will keep notifying you through callback when a line gets written.</p>

A building is specified by an ordered triple <strong>(Li, Hi, Ri)</strong> where <strong>Li</strong> and <strong>Ri</strong> are left and right coordinates, respectively, of building i and <strong>Hi</strong> is the height of the building. </p>

<p><img src=""https://imgur.com/SnSjn.gif"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>In the diagram below buildings are shown on the left with triples </p>

<pre><code>(1,11,5), (2,6,7), (3,13,9), (12,7,16), (14,3,25), (19,18,22), (23,13,29), (24,4,28) 
</code></pre>

<p>and the skyline, shown on the right, is represented by the sequence: </p>

<pre><code>1, 11, 3, 13, 9, 0, 12, 7, 16, 3, 19, 18, 22, 3, 23, 13, 29, 0 
</code></pre>

<p>The output should consist of the vector that describes the skyline as shown in the example above. In the skyline vector <strong>(v1, v2, v3, ... vn)</strong> , the <strong>vi</strong> such that i is an even number represent a horizontal line (height). The <strong>vi</strong> such that i is an odd number represent a vertical line (x-coordinate). The skyline vector should represent the ""path"" taken, for example, by a bug starting at the minimum x-coordinate and traveling horizontally and vertically over all the lines that define the skyline. Thus the last entry in the skyline vector will be a 0. The coordinates must be separated by a blank space.</p>

<p>If I will not count declaration of provided (test) buildings and including all spaces and tab characters, my solution, in Python, is <strong>223</strong> characters long.</p>

<p>Here is the condensed version:</p>

<pre><code>B=[[1,11,5],[2,6,7],[3,13,9],[12,7,16],[14,3,25],[19,18,22],[23,13,29],[24,4,28]]

# Solution.

R=range
v=[0 for e in R(max([y[2] for y in B])+1)]
for b in B:
   for x in R(b[0], b[2]):
      if b[1]&gt;v[x]:
         v[x]=b[1]
p=1
k=0
for x in R(len(v)):
   V=v[x]
   if p and V==0:
      continue
   elif V!=k:
      p=0
      print ""%s %s"" % (str(x), str(V)),
   k=V
</code></pre>

<p>I think that I didn't made any mistake but if so - feel free to criticize me.</p>

<p>I don't have much reputation, so I will pay only 100 for a bounty - I am curious, if anyone could try to solve this in less than .. lets say, 80 characters. Solution posted by <strong>cobbal</strong> is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1066234/the-skyline-problem/1073337#1073337"">101 characters long</a> and currently it is the best one.</p>

<p>I thought, that 80 characters is a sick limit for this kind of problem. <strong>cobbal</strong>, with his 46 character solution totaly amazed me - though I must admit, that I spent some time reading his explanation before I partially understood what he had written.</p>

"1069523","<p>I've been tasked to figure out how to find the centerline of a polygon.  My google searches led me to believe that what I need is called the 'Medial Axis'.  Like this:</p>

<sub>(source: <a href=""http://www.ndl.kiev.ua/downloads/center_line.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">kiev.ua</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>According to what I've read, what I need can be produced by using a 2D Voronoi diagram construction algorithm for segments.</p>

<p>I've found a C# version of the Voronoi algorithm on codeplex (FortuneVoronoi) and after applying my polygon to it, I end up with this:</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.carbonatlas.com/geonotes/gaia_voronoi.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">alt text http://www.carbonatlas.com/geonotes/gaia_voronoi.png</a></p>

<p>The green is the original polygon.  The orange are the Voronoi vertices and the black lines are the voronoi edges.</p>

<p>I can see the makings of what I need in those vertices, but I'm unsure of the next step required to filter out all the stuff I don't need.</p>

<ol>
<li>Build the Delaunay triangulation of the polygon vertices.</li>
<li>Identify the Voronoi vertices inside the polygon (see

<li>Output the Voronoi edges connecting two interior Voronoi vertices.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have huge data the intersections might be quite costly.</p>

<p>Then you could do a similar approach like in the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/996620/how-to-determine-if-a-delaunay-triangle-is-internal-or-external"">question</a>, and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/996620/how-to-determine-if-a-delaunay-triangle-is-internal-or-external/1002775#1002775"">this solution</a> could work for you, as well. The way I would do it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build the Delaunay triangulation of the polygon vertices.</li>
<li>Insert the midpoint of every polygon edge that is not covered by a delaunay edge. Do this recursively until all polygon edges are covered by Delaunay edges.</li>
<li>Mark all Delaunay edges which correspond to a polygon edge.</li>
<li>Extract the medial axis using steps 3.-5. in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/996620/how-to-determine-if-a-delaunay-triangle-is-internal-or-external/1002775#1002775"">this solution</a></li>

"1070872","<p>I'm an experienced git user now working with people who use Mercurial.  I really miss 'git gui' for helping me with my commits.  I see that two tools, <a href=""http://qct.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">qct</a> and <a href=""http://repo.or.cz/w/hgct.git"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hgct</a>, both support Mercurial.</p>

<p>The things I like best about git gui is that it shows all uncommitted files (and untracked files) and makes it easy for me to add whole files or individual diff hunks into a commit/changeset.  With that in mind, <strong>which tool am I likely to prefer</strong>, qct or hgct?  And from your experience, <strong>are there other grounds for preferring one tool over the other</strong>, and if so what are they?</p>

<hr>

<h2>EDIT</h2>

<p>I installed qct, hgct, and tortoisehg on a standard Debian testing system.  Of the three, qct was the only one to work out of the box.  But to do anything interesting, it seems to require a third-party tool like diffmerge.  (The web site claims otherwise, but Debian has not yet caught up to reality.)</p>

<p>I found qct quite frustrating.  Problems include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Cannot view more than one diff at a time</li>
<li>Cannot skip all remaining diffs with one mouse click</li>
<li><strong>Cannot go backwards</strong>!</li>
</ul>

<p>My tortoisehg installation experience was frustrating.  <code>.deb</code> files are promised on the web site, but they do not exist.  Pulling from the latest stable version gave me a tool that simply produced a stack trace on every invocation. (I found a fix, but really!)  After upgrading to the latest Debian <em>unstable</em>  hg, however, <strong>I was very impressed with the Tortoise Hg commit tool</strong>.  It is far and away the best approximation to git gui. </p>

<p>And as an afterthought, hgct was a clear loss:</p>

<p>

For the hour boxes: <code>x = sin(hour / 12 * 2 * pi)</code> and <code>y = cos(hour / 12 * 2 * pi)</code>. For the minute boxes: <code>x = sin(minute / 60 * 2 * pi)</code> and <code>y = cos(minute / 60 * 2 * pi)</code>. These will be relative to the center of the clock and will need to be multiplied by some constant. Actually, those equations might not be quite right, but the way to do it is something like that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But does it all work? Sure it does. You can revert a merge, and from a
  purely technical angle, git did it very naturally and had no real
  troubles.<br>
  It just considered it a change from ""state before merge"" to
  ""state after merge"", and that was it.<br>
  Nothing complicated, nothing odd,
  nothing really dangerous. Git will do it without even thinking about it.</p>
  
  <p>So from a technical angle, there's nothing wrong with reverting a merge,
  but <strong>from a workflow angle it's something that you generally should try to
  avoid</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>If at all possible, for example, if you find a problem that got merged
  into the main tree, <strong>rather than revert the merge, try <em>really</em> hard to</strong>:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>bisect the problem down into the branch you merged, and just fix it, </li>
  <li>or try to revert the individual commit that caused it.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Yes, it's more complex, and no, it's not always going to work (sometimes
  the answer is: ""oops, I really shouldn't have merged it, because it wasn't
  ready yet, and I really need to undo <em>all</em> of the merge""). So then you
  really should revert the merge, but when you want to re-do the merge, you
  now need to do it by reverting the revert.</p>

"1080638","<p>I need to initialize some three dimensional points, and I want them to be equally spaced throughout a cube. Are there any creative ways to do this?</p>

<p>I am using an iterative Expectation Maximization algorithm and I want my initial vectors to ""span"" the space evenly.</p>

<p>For example, suppose I have eight points that I want to space equally in a cube sized 1x1x1. I would want the points at the corners of a cube with a side length of 0.333, centered within the larger cube.</p>

<p>A 2D example is below. Notice that the red points are equidistant from eachother and the edges. I want the same for 3D.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/V2HfW.png"" alt=""Equidistant points""></p>

<p>In cases where the number of points does not have an integer cube root, I am fine with leaving some ""gaps"" in the arrangement.</p>

<p>Currently I am taking the cube root of the number of points and using that to calculate the number of points  and the desired distance between them. Then I iterate through the points and increment the X, Y and Z coordinates (staggered so that Y doesn't increment until X loops back to 0, same for Z with regard for Y).</p>

<p>If there's an easy way to do this in MATLAB, I'd gladly use it.</p>
","Equidistant points across a cube","<algorithm><matlab><math><3d><expectation-maximization>","2009-07-03 19:53:33","3847","1081021","5","<p>You'll have to define the problem in more detail for the cases where the number of points isn't a perfect cube.

x=l(2:n+1); y=x; z=x;
[X, Y, Z] = meshgrid(x, y, z);

<p>Then for each position in the matrices, the coordinates of that point are given by the corresponding elements of X, Y, and Z. If you want the points listed in a single matrix, such that each row represents a point, with the three columns for x, y, and z coordinates, then you can say:</p>

<pre><code>points(:,1) = reshape(X, [], 1);
points(:,2) = reshape(Y, [], 1);
points(:,3) = reshape(Z, [], 1);

<p>You now have a list of <code>n^3</code> points on a grid throughout the unit cube, excluding the boundaries. As others have suggested, you can probably randomly remove some of the points if you want fewer points. This would be easy to do, by using <code>randi([0 n^3], a, 1)</code> to generate <code>a</code> indices of points to remove.

"1081132","<p>I'm modeling a force-based physics simulation where several particles are interacting with each other.  The particles can move in such a way that a static viewport can easily lose track of them (imagine the whole group of particles moving off the screen to the right and the viewport displaying a blank background).</p>

<p>My current solution is to simply track the ""center"" of the particles by finding the min/max of the x's and y's and make the viewport's middle follow that.  It works fine (no need to find the true center of mass).  Here's a visual:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i581.photobucket.com/albums/ss259/colithium/Viewport.png"" alt=""Viewport""></p>

<p>My problem is I'm attempting to add the ability to manually drag particles around with the mouse.  I haven't found an elegant way to do this.  The problem is the translation between viewport coordinates and simulation coordinates is constantly changing because the viewport follows the particles' center.</p>

<p>When I mouse down on a particle I want it to have a fixed location in the simulation (it ignores all forces on it).  When I move the mouse with the button depressed I want the particle to move in the simulation.  I have achieved this.  However, it produces unpleasant side-effects because of the viewport and the other particles that are still in motion.  The particle isn't moving in the simulation when the mouse is depressed and stationary but it is moving on screen because the center of all the particles changes and the viewport adjusts accordingly.  The cursor is stationary so the particle ""moves"" out from under it.  When the mouse is moved ever-so-slightly, the particle teleports back under the cursor because the cursor's new position represents radically different simulation coordinates.</p>

<p><strong>Any suggestions for a nice, coherent user experience without the above side effects?</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I've already thought of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pausing the simulation while the mouse is down</li>
<li>Suspending viewport changes while the mouse is down</li>
<li>Moving the mouse cursor as the viewport changes (really bad)</li>
</ul>

<p>But they all have other bad side-effects or take away value from the simulation.</p>

<p>Also, I think this question is language and platform agnostic so don't attach literal and implementation-specific meanings to ""viewport"", ""viewport coordinates"", or ""simulation coordinates"".  Treat them as generic graphics concepts.</p>

<p>EDIT: Right after I posted this problem I just realized the problem might be the fact that read is reading the new lines and thus the array isn't big enough to hold it all.</p>
","Reading input from file prints strange symbols","<c++><file-io>","2009-07-04 20:15:29","3654","1082935","3","<p>Two problems with your code.</p>

<p>First, it looks like you're not accounting for newlines in your maxNum buffer size, so it stops reading either 19 or 38 characters before the end of the text file (depending on if you're using Unix-style or Windows-style line breaks).  Either increase the value of maxNum accordingly, or remove the line breaks from your text file.</p>

<p>Second, since you're using a char array instead of a std::string to hold the buffer, it needs to be null-terminated to display properly if you use the stream operator.  Add the following line after you read the buffer in (you'll also need to increase your buffer size by one to account for the extra character).</p>

<pre><code>buffer[maxNum-1] = '\0';

<p>Alternatively, you can use cout.write() to display a known-length buffer that's not null-terminated, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>cout.write(buffer, maxNum);

<ul>
<li>How should I go about parsing expressions like: <em>((P => Q) &amp; (Q => R)) => (P => R)</em></li>
<li>Should I use a parser generator like ANTLr or YACC, or use straight regular expressions?</li>
<li>Once I have the expression parsed, how should I go about generating the truth table?  Each section of the expression needs to be divided up into its smallest components and re-built from the left side of the table to the right.  How would I evaluate something like that?</li>
</ul>

<p>Can anyone provide me with tips concerning the parsing of these arbitrary expressions and eventually evaluating the parsed expression?</p>
","How can I build a Truth Table Generator?","<c#><parsing><boolean-logic><parser-generator><truthtable>","2009-07-05 21:40:44","14157","1084968","5","<p>This sounds like a great personal project. You'll learn a lot about how the basic parts of a compiler work.  I would skip trying to use a parser generator; if this is for your own edification, you'll learn more by doing it all from scratch.</p>

<p>The way such systems work is a formalization of how we understand natural languages.  If I give you a sentence: ""The dog, Rover, ate his food."", the first thing you do is break it up into words and punctuation. ""The"", ""SPACE"", ""dog"", ""COMMA"", ""SPACE"", ""Rover"", ... That's ""tokenizing"" or ""lexing"". </p>

<p>The next thing you do is analyze the token stream to see if the sentence is grammatical. The grammar of English is extremely complicated, but this sentence is pretty straightforward. SUBJECT-APPOSITIVE-VERB-OBJECT.  This is ""parsing"".</p>

<p>Once you know that the sentence is grammatical, you can then analyze the sentence to actually get meaning out of it. For instance, you can see that there are three parts of this sentence -- the subject, the appositive, and the ""his"" in the object -- that all refer to the same entity, namely, the dog. You can figure out that the dog is the thing doing the eating, and the food is the thing being eaten. This is the semantic analysis phase.</p>

<p>Compilers then have a fourth phase that humans do not, which is they generate code that represents the actions described in the language. </p>

<p>So, do all that. Start by defining what the tokens of your language are, define a base class Token and a bunch of derived classes for each. (IdentifierToken, OrToken, AndToken, ImpliesToken, RightParenToken...).  Then write a method that takes a string and returns an IEnumerable'. That's your lexer.</p>

<p>Second, figure out what the grammar of your language is, and write a recursive descent parser that breaks up an IEnumerable into an abstract syntax tree that represents grammatical entities in your language.</p>

<p>Then write an analyzer that looks at that tree and figures stuff out, like ""how many distinct free variables do I have?""</p>

<p>Then write a code generator that spits out the code necessary to evaluate the truth tables. Spitting IL seems like overkill, but if you wanted to be really buff, you could. It might be easier to let the expression tree library do that for you; you can transform your parse tree into an expression tree, and then turn the expression tree into a delegate, and evaluate the delegate.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>So if the move vector (B-A) normalized and multiplied with the objects speed would bring it within D of any point in C the vector is rotated so that it doesn't.</p>

<p>This is in two dimensions. Also, if this operation has a name, please make a comment or edit this question yourself as I had no idea of what to call it.</p>

<p>Also, my first instinct was to divide the active area into nodes and run a A* but I want to try the mathematical approach on this one, a few experiments with flocking gives me the impression that it can be done.</p>

<p>Assuming we start at the point to the left, we start turning right towards the goal (the other point), we detect a wall on the right so we stop turning and move forward. The wall is gone so we are allowed to start turning towards the goal again, and so on. I know this may cause the object to not get there at all, but I want to define a <strong>behavior</strong>, not necessarily a <strong>solution</strong>, if you know what I mean.</p>

<p><strong>Update2</strong>: Translating the active area into a set of nodes might prove inefficient. A* and other heuristic graph traversal algorithms are great for low dimensional problems. But the area I want to move across is infinite in size and only has a handful of obstacles scattered across it. The nodes themselves, or rather the potential positions, are infinitely small. This could of course be optimized with a quad tree of some sort but I have a feeling simple movement vectors that are in some way rotated and interpolated can solve this as well.</p>

<pre><code>protected void layout(int maxWidth, int maxHeight) 
    {  
        setExtent(maxWidth, maxHeight);
        // setExtent(Math.min(weight, maxWidth), Math.min(height, maxHeight));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a reason you commented that line?  I think what's happening is that your custom field  is taking up the whole width, and in your paint method you're drawing the bitmap at the extreme left, making it look like the field is aligned left.  If you uncomment that line, and add a field style bit of Field.FIELD_HCENTER when you construct your field it should work.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can keep the layout as is, and just draw the bitmap centered, by changing the line in your paint method to something like this</p>

<pre><code>graphics.drawBitmap((this.getWidth()-img.getWidth())/2, 0 , img.getWidth(), img.getHeight(), img, 0, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>The field will still take up the whole width, but the image will be centered.  This might cause unexpected behavior on touchscreen devices (i.e. the Storm).</p>

<p>If you're very curious about the red AND the 200 OK, check out what you have under the plus button. If that doesn't answer your question (do you have a page but maybe it's a 404 page?), fire up a packet sniffer to see in full detail what happens after the initial error header.</p>

<p>Create a single instance and reuse it repeatedly. You can use a static variable, but that won't be thread-safe. In this particular case, creating a new instance per page would probably be okay. However, you'll still get the same data if two people access the page at the same time.</p>

<p>Ideally, you could create a static random used in a thread-safe way, to create new instances of Random which can then be used without locking within a single thread. For example:</p>

<pre><code>public static class RandomFactory
{
    private static Random rng = new Random();
    private static readonly object padlock = new object();

    public static Random CreateRandom()
    {
        lock (padlock)
        {
            return new Random(rng.Next());
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your page you could have:</p>

<pre><code>// Instance variable
protected readonly Random rng = RandomFactory.CreateRandom();
</code></pre>

<p>and change your method to:</p>

<pre><code>public static string GetRandomNumber(this HtmlHelper html, Random rng,
                                     int low, int high)
{
    return rng.Next(low, high).ToString();
}

<p>(I'm not quite sure why you've got <code>HtmlHelper</code> at all there, to be honest - you're not using it...)</p>

<p>and finally your mark-up to things like this:</p>

"1100455","<p>I've moved all image resources in a large multi-project solution to a new project specifically created for shared resources.</p>

<p>Adding a new reference to other projects where the shared images are used is working as expected. The image in the selected button below continues to appear in designer but with issues.</p>

<p>In VS Designer, I'm unable to select shared resources in the Image Editor, having instead to manually edit the designer code. </p>

<p>More specifically, in the Image Editor dialog (accessed from the 'Image' property of an existing control) I select 'Select from File/Resource..."" to pop up the Select Resource dialog (shown). There, where I used to access all local project resources (Resources.resx), I would like now to add access to the new shared resources project. Ideally, I would add a second item to the dropdown shown which switches to the resx for the shared resources project.</p>

<p>How can this be done? Is there a better way?</p>

","Issue with shared WinForms resources across projects in Visual Studio","<winforms><visual-studio-designer>","2009-07-08 20:43:00","11544","6270507","7","<p>I was able to share a resx file between project and using it in the designer in VS 2008 SP1 (I don't know other versions). Differently from other approaches, here resources are statically and dynamically shared, so at runtime there's really one copy of the shared resources. No storage or memory waste and it's easy to maintain with tons of projects.</p>
<p>Follow the guide and tell me if it works for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a class project Resources;</li>
<li>Create a resource file (go to Properties -&gt; Resources of the project);</li>
<li>Move the resource file (default Resources.resx) to the <strong>root</strong> of the project;</li>
<li>Rename the resources file Resources.resx -&gt; GlobalResources.resx;</li>
<li>Modify the resources file modifier to Public (double click on the resources file, &quot;Access Modifier&quot; -&gt; &quot;Public&quot;);</li>
<li>Copy any resource file to the <strong>root directory</strong> of the project;</li>
<li>Add any resource to the resource file using <strong>&quot;Add Existing File&quot;</strong> and selecting resources on the <strong>root</strong> directory of the project.</li>
</ul>
<p>The project in the Solution Explorer should look like this:</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/IWPDU.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></p>
<p>Now in any project you need the resx file to be shared do this:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add the &quot;Resource&quot; project as a dipendency;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Edit manually the project file (*.csproj) and add the following lines in the resources file ItemGroup (create a local resource file if you want to see it):</p>
<pre><code> &lt;ItemGroup&gt;
   ...
   &lt;EmbeddedResource Include=&quot;..\Resources\GlobalResources.resx&quot;&gt;
     &lt;Link&gt;GlobalResources.resx&lt;/Link&gt;
     &lt;Generator&gt;ResXFileCodeGenerator&lt;/Generator&gt;
     &lt;LastGenOutput&gt;GlobalResources.Designer.cs&lt;/LastGenOutput&gt;
     &lt;CustomToolNamespace&gt;Resources&lt;/CustomToolNamespace&gt;
   &lt;/EmbeddedResource&gt;
   ...
 &lt;/ItemGroup&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, the &quot;Include&quot; attribute should be the correct relative path to GlobalResources.resx.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the resources in the designer as you was asking.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my project, the following lines are generated and added to the project automatically when I do this:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Compile Include=&quot;..\Resources\GlobalResources.Designer.cs&quot;&gt;
  &lt;Link&gt;GlobalResources.Designer.cs&lt;/Link&gt;
  &lt;AutoGen&gt;True&lt;/AutoGen&gt;
  &lt;DesignTime&gt;True&lt;/DesignTime&gt;
  &lt;DependentUpon&gt;GlobalResources.resx&lt;/DependentUpon&gt;
&lt;/Compile&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If they aren't added, add them manually.</p>
<p>Now the project should look like this in the Solution Explorer (likend files should be marked differently):</p>
<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/WHOIa.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></p>
<p>Last two steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the linked &quot;GlobalResources.resx&quot; and on the Properties set &quot;None&quot; as the &quot;BuildAction&quot;. &quot;Custom Tool Namespace&quot; should already be set to &quot;Resources&quot;;</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/5DAhT.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the linked &quot;GlobalResources.Designer.resx&quot; and on the Properties set &quot;None&quot; as the &quot;BuildAction&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/A72Db.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></p>
<p>And you are done: at this point you should really be able to use the resources you added in the shared resx in the designer selecting &quot;GlobalResources.resx&quot; in the &quot;Project Resource file&quot; dialog of your question. And as told it's really shared even at runtime! In the Properties panel you should see the full Namespace and class of the external project. If you remove the dependency on the &quot;Resource&quot; project it doesn't even compile. If it doesn't work for you, insist until it works and in case tell me where the guide is wrong. It have to work! Let me know.</p>

"1102175","<p>I'm modeling a very basic ASP.NET MVC app using NHibernate and I seem to be stuck on my design. Here's a sketch of my model:</p> 

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/9GzAt.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/9GzAt.png"" alt=""model 1""></a>
</p>

<p>As you can see this is VERY basic but I have some concerns about it. The User root entity and the Organization root entity are accessing the same Organization_Users entity child via two one-to-many relationships. This doesn't seem right and I think I am breaking the aggregate boundaries. This model smells to me but I like the idea because I would like to have code like this:</p>

<pre><code>var user = userRepository.Load(1);
var list = user.Organizations; // All the organizations the user is a part of.
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>var org = orgRepository.Load(1);
var list = org.Users; // All the users in an organization.
</code></pre>

<p>Also the extra data in the table like flagged and role would be used by the Organization entity. Is this a bad design? If you have any thoughts that would be great. I'm still trying to get my mind around the thinking of DDD. Thanks</p>

The one catch with this approach is that you need to create an <strong>OganizationUser</strong> class in your domain to handle the <em>Role</em> and <em>Flagged</em> fields from you Domain.  This would leave you with something like this in your code.</p>

<pre><code>var user = userRepository.Load(1);
var list = user.OrganizationUsers; // All the organizations the user is a part of including their role and flagged values.

var organization = list[0].Organization; 
</code></pre>

<p>*If you're going to be iterating through all a users organizations quite often you'd likely want to eager load the <strong>Organization</strong> entity along with <strong>OrganzitionUser</strong></p>

<p>With the second design you submitted it looks like you would be able to add a user to the <strong>OrgUserDetails</strong> without adding the user to <strong>OrganizationUser</strong>.  That doesn't seem like something I would want to support from my Domain.</p>

<ol>
<li>ask for memory dumps</li>
<li>install a remote debugger on a client machine</li>
<li>add tracing code to builds</li>
<li>add logging code for debugging purposes</li>
<li>add performance counters</li>
<li>add configuration parameters to various bits of suspicious code so I can turn on and off features</li>
<li>rewrite and refactor suspicious code</li>
<li>try to replicate the issue locally on a different OS or machine</li>
<li>use debugging tools such as application verifier</li>
<li>use 3rd party load generation tools</li>
<li>write simulation tools in-house for load generation when the above failed</li>

"1104285","<p>I have a number of relatively simple (auto-generated) graphs in graphviz dot format.  These show the path through a state machine, but dot has a slightly confusing habit of deciding that two nodes must be on the same rank when I would like the graph to be in state order.  I've tried a lot of settings (including the <code>:n</code> and <code>:s</code> and the <code>weight</code> listed below), but I cannot persuade dot to place the Third State <b>above</b> the Fourth State.</p>

<p>I have this problem with a lot of graphs: there seems to be something internal to dot that decides that it would be better if two nodes were on the same rank and there's nothing that can be done to override it.  I've even had code that specifies that one node should be a <code>rank=sink</code>, but dot has decided to put another node below it anyway.</p>

<p>Is there any way to suggest to dot that it's more important that the nodes are in order than any other constraint?</p>

You can see that because of the presence of Table Scans within the execution plan.</p>

<p>Table Scans hit performance as they mean the whole table is being scanned for data that matches the given clauses in the query.</p>

<p>I'd recommend you add an index on BACHNUMB in GL10001</p>

"1105625","<p>In company that I work for, I was given the opportunity to write an application, which would replace the old Excel workbook, which is used to plan the production queue. Because VBA was simple and Excel was easy to use, for few years this workbook was used by several people to plan/add changes/notes about current production status. Whole workbook has few feature's (additional information about products are stored in different sheets, etc), but is lacking many more.</p>

<p>I sketched how it looks like (I recreated it from memory, simplified the layout, so it can be readable): </p>

I would recommend using Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Express.  Very powerful and free for a certain amount of users.  If you want to go open source, I would recommend using Postgres instead of MySql.

<p>I would like to be able to reduce the size of this panel if it's wider than the ruler drawn above it, which is already dynamically resizing as I want, but would like the values beneath the labels to stay at the size they are for the sake of readability.</p>

<p>What would be the best way to approach this? I've considered setting the FontSize properties of the labels or using a ScaleTransform but I'm unsure which of these is the best way to go. Is there a way to derive the width that the panel will adopt without actually changing the font sizes and then testing ActualWidth? If I could do this it would make this task easier.</p>

"1117211","<p>I would like to tint an image with a color reference. The results should look like the Multiply blending mode in Photoshop, where <em>whites</em> would be replaced with <em>tint</em>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/CqiUz.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I will be changing the color value continuously.</p>

<p><strong>Follow up:</strong> I would put the code to do this in my ImageView's drawRect: method, right?</p>

<p>As always, a <em>code snippet</em> would greatly aid in my understanding, as opposed to a link.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Subclassing a UIImageView with the code <strong>Ramin</strong> suggested. </p>

<p>I put this in viewDidLoad: of my view controller:</p>

<pre><code>[self.lena setImage:[UIImage imageNamed:kImageName]];
[self.lena setOverlayColor:[UIColor blueColor]];
[super viewDidLoad];
</code></pre>

<p>I see the image, but it is not being tinted. I also tried loading other images, setting the image in IB, and calling setNeedsDisplay: in my view controller.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: drawRect: is not being called.</p>

<p><strong>Final update:</strong> I found an old project that had an imageView set up properly so I could test Ramin's code and it works like a charm!</p>

<p><strong>Final, final update:</strong></p>

<p>For those of you just learning about Core Graphics, here is the simplest thing that could possibly work.</p>

<p>In your subclassed UIView:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)drawRect:(CGRect)rect {

    CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();

    CGContextSetFillColor(context, CGColorGetComponents([UIColor colorWithRed:0.5 green:0.5 blue:0 alpha:1].CGColor)); // don't make color too saturated

    CGContextFillRect(context, rect); // draw base

    [[UIImage imageNamed:@""someImage.png""] drawInRect: rect blendMode:kCGBlendModeOverlay alpha:1.0]; // draw image
}
</code></pre>
","How would I tint an image programmatically on iOS?","<ios><cocoa-touch><image-processing><uiimage><tint>","2009-07-12 23:38:02","59256","1118005","13","<p>First you'll want to subclass UIImageView and override the drawRect method. Your class needs a UIColor property (let's call it overlayColor) to hold the blend color and a custom setter that forces a redraw when the color changes. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) setOverlayColor:(UIColor *)newColor {
   if (overlayColor)
     [overlayColor release];

   overlayColor = [newColor retain];
   [self setNeedsDisplay]; // fires off drawRect each time color changes
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the drawRect method you'll want to draw the image first then overlay it with a rectangle filled with the color you want along with the proper blending mode, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void) drawRect:(CGRect)area
{
  CGContextRef context = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();
  CGContextSaveGState(context);

  // Draw picture first
  //
  CGContextDrawImage(context, self.frame, self.image.CGImage);

  // Blend mode could be any of CGBlendMode values. Now draw filled rectangle
  // over top of image.
  //
  CGContextSetBlendMode (context, kCGBlendModeMultiply);
  CGContextSetFillColor(context, CGColorGetComponents(self.overlayColor.CGColor));      
  CGContextFillRect (context, self.bounds);
  CGContextRestoreGState(context);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Ordinarily to optimize the drawing you would restrict the actual drawing to only the area passed in to drawRect, but since the background image has to be redrawn each time the color changes it's likely the whole thing will need refreshing.</p>

<p>To use it create an instance of the object then set the <code>image</code> property (inherited from UIImageView) to the picture and <code>overlayColor</code> to a UIColor value (the blend levels can be adjusted by changing the alpha value of the color you pass down).</p>

Not to get into the gory details, there are several tutorials out there describing this already. Now, it does seem weird that to get a button-like behaviour from a ToolStripDropDownButton one has to do the drawing oneself, but I'm not ruling out that a setting might have clashed with another somewhere.</p>

<p><strong>My thoughts:</strong></p>

<p>I have tried investigating this with Firebug without any success. The CSS from the WP-Syntax plugin should be the same in all three theme cases. So the fact that it looks wierd with this theme has to do with some inherited CSS property from the LightWord theme.</p>

<p>This in turn probably means that the WP-Syntax plugin should reset something more for its CSS to work correctly.</p>

<p>Advanced CSS isn't something I'm good at. But I would very much like to resolve this problem as soon as possible. I'm also curious from a technical view point what could be causing this behavior? I hope someone with good CSS skills will be able to help out!</p>

<p>We (you if you want to, me if you don't feel like it) could then file a bug report in the appropriate place, to get these components working together.</p>

<p>EDIT</p>

<p>I've just noticed, your left ListBox is not updated because you have no DataTemplate set for a Person object. What you have now is a ToString() implementation, which does not get updated once it reports to the UI.</p>

<p>You need something like this:</p>

"1132669","<p><strong>Overview</strong><br>
I'm using a listfield class to display a set of information vertically. Each row of that listfield takes up 2/5th's of the screen height.</p>

<p>As such, when scrolling to the next item (especially when displaying an item partially obscured by the constraints of the screen height), the whole scroll/focus action is very jumpy.</p>

<p>I would like to fix this jumpiness by implementing smooth scrolling between scroll/focus actions. Is this possible with the ListField class?</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong> <br>
Below is a screenshot displaying the issue at hand. </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/lBTJE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/lBTJE.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></a><br>
<sub>(source: <a href=""http://perkmobile.com/smooth_scroll.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">perkmobile.com</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>Once the user scrolls down to ListFieldTHREE row, this row is ""scrolled"" into view in a very jumpy manner, no smooth scrolling. I know making the row height smaller will mitigate this issue, but I don't wan to go that way.</p>

<p><strong>Main Question</strong> <br>
How do I do smooth scrolling in a ListField? </p>
","Blackberry - How to implement ListField Smooth Scrolling?","<java><blackberry><scroll><listfield><smooth-scrolling>","2009-07-15 17:06:49","6092","1138122","3","<p>Assuming you want the behavior that the user scrolls down 1 'click' of the trackball, and the next item is then highlighted but instead of an immediate scroll jump you get a smooth scroll to make the new item visible (like in Google's Gmail app for BlackBerry), you'll have to roll your own component.</p>

<p>The basic idea is to subclass VerticalFieldManager, then on a scroll (key off the moveFocus method) you have a separate Thread update a vertical position variable, and invalidate the manager multiple times.  </p>

<p>The thread is necessary because if you think about it you're driving an animation off of a user event - the smooth scroll is really an animation on the BlackBerry, as it lasts longer than the event that triggered it.</p>

<p>I've been a bit vague on details, and this isn't a really easy thing to do, so hopefully this helps a bit.</p>

<p>Basically, I need a sidebar div whose width expands according to the content inside of it and a <code>mainContent</code> that expands to the rest of the width of the window.</p>

The side bar will expand to the width of its text, and that means the text will not wrap.  I think that is probably not what you want.  Or maybe it is, if what you are putting in there is not vary wide, but isn't fixed either?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

The primary key in the parent table is the foreign key in the up to n child table rows.</p>

<p>Now if that primary key in the parent table gets UPDATE, the UPDATE RULE kicks in. Either all the child rows are also updated, set to NULL or whatever. Best practice however is to have a primary key that NEVER changes (a fixed ID or something), so that's the less important rule.</p>

<p>The more important one is the DELETE rule - what if the parent row is deleted (e.g. the Order is deleted)? You can either also delete all child rows (all the Order line items) with CASCADE DELETE, or you can set their foreign key to NULL (they don't have a parent anymore) - that's totally up to your concrete scenario.</p>

<p>In the Order/order lines scenario, it might be totally useful to delete the order lines when the complete order gets deleted, but you probably don't want to delete a product, just because an order that references it has been deleted - there's no one single CORRECT answer - it depends on your scenario and your app.</p>

"1147987","<p>I am uploading large files to an ASP.NET server using a standard HTML <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> control posting multipart-form data. This is an ASP.NET MVC application.</p>

<p>According to MSDN, the <code>HttpPostedFile</code> class buffers to disk out of the box:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Files are uploaded in MIME
  multipart/form-data format. By
  default, all requests, including form
  fields and uploaded files, larger than
  256 KB are buffered to disk, rather
  than held in server memory.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I assume this means that when I access <code>HttpPostedFileBase</code> in my controller, that when I access the <code>HttpPostedFileBase</code>'s <code>InputStream</code> property, I can write the file buffer somewhere without having to worry about the server running out of memory, which is obviously an unworkable solution.</p>

<p>Here's a bit of pseudocode for how I'm handling each of the incoming files from <code>HttpPostedFileBase</code>.</p>

<pre><code>for(var i = 0; i&lt; Request.Files.Count;i++)
{
    var fileBase = Request.Files[i];
    if (fileBase.ContentLength == 0)
    {
        continue;
    }

    // One thread per file
    ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(state =&gt;
    {
        // Read from fileBase.InputStream
    }, 
    null);
}
</code></pre>

<p>My web.config's httpRuntime block looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;httpRuntime
  executionTimeout=""1200""
  requestLengthDiskThreshold=""2097151""
  maxRequestLength=""2097151""
  useFullyQualifiedRedirectUrl=""false""
  minFreeThreads=""8""
  minLocalRequestFreeThreads=""4""
  appRequestQueueLimit=""100"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My implementation works, multiple files are uploaded as expected, except that the same amount of memory required to buffer the entire payload is consumed by the server. I have to assume that the InputStream is buffering everything. When I upload more files than I have memory, it predictably crashes with an <code>OutOfMemoryException</code>. Here's an image of the memory spike when uploading an 800mb file.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/0CfkT.png"" alt=""alt text"" title=""Memory Fail""></p>

<p>I know I could use a Flash/Silverlight widget or write a custom <code>HttpModule</code> to intercept uploads and handle them myself, but the current requirement would work flawlessly if <code>HttpPostedFile</code> did what MSDN says it does (or I'm doing it wrong).</p>

<p>In my opinion, there is only one way to get good estimates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Calculate the exact number of bytes to be copied before you begin the copy process</li>
<li>Recalculate you estimate regularly (every 1, 5 or 10 seconds, YMMV) based on the current transfer speed </li>
<li>The current transfer speed can fluctuate heavily when you are copying on a network, so use an average, for example based on the amount of bytes transfered since your last estimate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the first point may require quite some work, if you are copying many files. That is probably why the guys from Microsoft decided to go without it. You need to decide yourself if the additional overhead created by that calculation is worth giving your user a better estimate.</p>

This array has 52 pairs (about 40 bytes), and I want to find the first pair before the specified one that has it's values different from 0 (used pair).
The obvious solution would be to check each pair &lt; than this one (scan from right to left), but this seems to be very inefficient if there are many unused pairs (set to 0).  </p>

<p>This image may explain better the situation:<br>
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/eB0bN.png""/><br>
Pairs 0, 1 and 51 are used.<br>
I want to find the first used pair before 51 (which is 1 here).  </p>

<p>I tried tricks like  </p>

<pre><code>if(*((int *)&amp;array[arrayPos]) == 0) {
    arrayPos -= sizeof(int);
    pairPos -= ???
}  
</code></pre>

<p>The problem here is that subtracting from <em>pairPos</em> is not that simple, because of the 6 bits/pair, so I ended with a lookup table based on some relations between <em>pairPos</em> and <em>arrayPos</em>, and all this made the solution perform like the trivial one.  </p>

<p>Is there any way to make this lookup faster ? Another problem is that there is only 1 unused byte... maybe I can make space for another 4. If there were at least 7 I could use a bitmap of the array and it would be much faster to skip over unused pairs.</p>

1. make the items 1 byte (not 6 bits than before) - thanks Skizz<br>
2. use a bitmap to see which item is the nearest on the left. This was much faster than going back with the technique described by djna.  </p>

<p>The speed improvements are impressive:<br>
in one test case, from 13s it's now 6.5s<br>

<p>Basically this code just prints n numbers of lines with the specific format.</p>

<ul>
<li>Bullet list</li>
<li>Indented</li>
<li>and TabStops</li>
</ul>

<sub>(source: <a href=""http://files.lans-msp.de/vbscript_tabstops.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lans-msp.de</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>The Code works perfectly for an arbitrary number of lines, but then at some point Word just stops applying the TabStops. </p>

<p>I know that if I wouldn't reset the format every 10 lines, the code would work seemingly forever (really?!?). But the every 10 line brake is a must.</p>

<p>The exact line number where everything breaks down is dependent on the amount of RAM. On my work computer with 1GB it only works until about line 800(as you can see). My computer at home with 4GB didn't show this behaviour. But I'm sure it would have shown it as well if I had it let run long enough, because in my production code(which is a bit more complex) my home computer shows the problem as well.</p>

<p>Is this some kind of memory leak or something? What did I do wrong? Is maybe, god-forbid, VBA itself the culprit here?</p>

<p>in my initialization code I have the following:</p>

<pre>
    glEnable(GL_ALPHA_TEST);
    glAlphaFunc(GL_GREATER, 0.0f);
    glEnable(GL_BLEND);
    glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA,GL_SRC_ALPHA);
</pre>

<p>You can see in the screen shot that for some reason, the rays passing between the perspective view point and the sphere are being color blended with the axis line behind the sphere, rather than with the sphere itself.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot:</p>

<p>Can anyone explain what I am doing wrong here?</p>

<p>Thanks!!</p>
","OpenGL Alpha blending with wrong color","<c++><qt><opengl>","2009-07-22 18:06:36","2362","1167151","3","<p>Is it a possibility you cast those rays before you draw the sphere?</p>

<p>Then if Z-buffer is enabled, the sphere's fragments simply won't be rendered, as those parts of rays are closer. When you are drawing something semi-transparent (using blending), you should watch the order you draw things carefully.</p>

<p>In fact I think you cannot use Z-buffer in any sensible way together with ray-tracing process. You'll have to track Z-order manually. While we are at it OpenGL might not be the best API to visualize ray-tracing process. (It will do so possibly much slower than pure software ray-tracer)</p>

"1167230","<p>In AccuRev, when I look at the history for a file (in ""history mode""), I see a list of the actions that were taken on the file.  Each action has a number (#) and a version.</p>

<p>When I click on one of these actions, another list appears that shows each of the files that was involved in the action (including the one whose history I'm investigating).  Each entry in this lower panel has a ""virtual version"" and a ""real version"".</p>

<p>The ""version"" in the top panel appears to be the same as the ""virtual version"" of my file in the lower panel.</p>

<p>What is the difference between the #, the virtual version, and the real version?  Why do virtual and real versions have two numbers separated by a slash?</p>

","What are the various AccuRev version numbers?","<accurev>","2009-07-22 18:28:26","1981","1172036","2","<p>I found the AccuRev documentation to be confusing.  Here is what I've come to understand:</p>

<p># is the transaction number.  Every action in an AccuRev depot is assigned a unique (auto-incrementing) transaction number.  When multiple files are affected in one action, they share the transaction number.</p>

<p>""Virtual version"" is the stream name (or number), followed by a slash, followed by the count of which version it is on that stream.  So, the first version of helloworld.c on the IntegrationStream is IntegrationStream/1, or perhaps a number like 123/1.  If AccuRev shows you a number you can <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2410481/accurev-convert-from-stream-number-to-stream-name/2410881#2410881"">look up the corresponding stream name</a>.  If multiple changes have been kept on the file in another stream and the file with multiple changes is finally promoted to this stream (IntegrationStream), this increments the number only by one.  So the next version visible on this stream would be IntegrationStream/2 (or 123/2).</p>

<p>The ""real version"" refers to the first time that revision of the file was seen in the depot.  This would be when the original keep operation was performed in someone's workspace.  So if the version of the file seen in IntegrationStream/2 is the result of a keep in Proj_jsmith/7 which was promoted up to IntegrationStream, then the real version shows up as Proj_jsmith/7.</p>

<p>The ancestor, merge and patch version, if applicable, can be best understood by switching to ""version browser mode"" where the ancestor, merge, and patch lines are shown.  Those columns in the lower panel grid refer to the versions that are associated to the given version of a file by preceding it as an ancestor or by being the source of a merge or patch.</p>

"1168289","<p>I am creating RESTful services for several database entities based on a modified version of the <a href=""http://www.bisdm.org/information/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">BISDM</a>.  Some of these entities have associated lookup tables, such as depicted below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/DpiNn.png"" alt=""Snippet of modified BISDM schema""></p>

<p>The lookup tables are associated with one and only one table.  Additionally, the lookup tables will be used by the client application to populate dropdown lists, treeviews, and comboboxes for the editable fields of their associated entity table.</p>

<p>Should lookup values / table get their own URI or should they ""share"" one with the parent to which they are associated?  What are the pros / cons of each?</p>

<p>From what you've shown, it looks like you have three resources: </p>

<ul>
<li>Space</li>
<li>SpaceCategory</li>
<li>Lookup</li>
</ul>

<p>The URIs you give to these resources are largely a matter of taste. For example, nothing in REST prevents you from defining a URI system in which every resource, regardless of its type, is assigned a hash code and accessed through:</p>

<p><a href=""http://example.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://example.com/</a>{hash}</p>

<p>Some frameworks, such as Rails, make it convenient to create nested resource URI heirarchies using the name of the resource in the URI. But this is just a convention your application can follow or not.</p>

<p>REST defines a number of constraints, one of the most difficult to grok is that an application be <a href=""http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">hypertext-driven</a>. One of the advantages of this constraint is that it promotes <strong>loose coupling</strong> between your app and its clients.</p>

<p>The idea is that when a client requests a resource through a URI, part of the contract is that the client can only choose another URI based on the links provided in the resource representation. This is not unlike the way you use a browser to follow links in a web page.</p>

<p>This contrasts with a RPC-style approach where URI templates are published and become hardwired into client code.</p>

<p>If at some point in the future you decide nested URIs work better than flat ones, you can change your URI scheme and it won't break any client code. You can even move resources to a completely different domain, or change protocols from HTTP to HTTPS, or FTP. Your URI templates haven't been published and so no client code should have been written against them.</p>

<p>Instead, your application simply begins serving the new links, and the client starts following those.</p>

<p>I found all of this mind-numbingly abstract when I was initially exposed to it (and am still feeling my way). There aren't many examples that illustrate the concept, but for one, check out the <a href=""http://kenai.com/projects/suncloudapis/pages/Home"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sun Cloud API</a>.</p>

<p>Should lookups get their own repository interface, ""share"" one with the associated entity, or should there be a generic ILookupRepository interface?</p>

"1180714","<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I found a solution. See my Answer below.</p>

<h2>My Question</h2>

<p>How can I optimize this query to minimize my downtime? I need to update over 50 schemas with the number of tickets ranging from 100,000 to 2 million. Is it advisable to attempt to set all fields in tickets_extra at the same time? I feel that there is a solution here that I'm just not seeing. Ive been banging my head against this problem for over a day.</p>

<p>Also, I initially tried without using a sub SELECT, but the performance was <em>much</em> worse than what I currently have.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I'm trying to optimize my database for a report that needs to be run. The fields I need to aggregate on are very expensive to calculate, so I am denormalizing my <a href=""https://gist.github.com/82b992328d6d32d00d9c"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">existing schema</a> a bit to accommodate this report. Note that I simplified the tickets table quite a bit by removing a few dozen irrelevant columns.</p>

<p>My report will be aggregating ticket counts by <strong>Manager When Created</strong> and <strong>Manager When Resolved</strong>. This complicated relationship is diagrammed here:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/baPE4.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/baPE4.png"" alt=""EAV""></a><br>
<sub>(source: <a href=""http://cdn.cloudfiles.mosso.com/c163801/eav.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mosso.com</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>To avoid the half dozen nasty joins required to calculate this on-the-fly I've added the following table to my schema:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; show create table tickets_extra\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
       Table: tickets_extra
Create Table: CREATE TABLE `tickets_extra` (
  `ticket_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `manager_created` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `manager_resolved` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`ticket_id`),
  KEY `manager_created` (`manager_created`,`manager_resolved`),
  KEY `manager_resolved` (`manager_resolved`,`manager_created`)
) ENGINE=MyISAM DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>The problem now is, I haven't been storing this data anywhere. The manager was always calculated dynamically. I have <strong>millions</strong> of tickets across several databases with the same schema that need to have this table populated. I want to do this in as efficient a way as possible, but have been unsuccessful in optimizing the queries I'm using to do so:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO tickets_extra (ticket_id, manager_created)
SELECT
  t.id, 
  su.user_id
FROM (
  SELECT 
    t.id, 
    shift_times.shift_id AS shift_id 
  FROM tickets t
  JOIN shifts ON t.shop_id = shifts.shop_id 
  JOIN shift_times ON (shifts.id = shift_times.shift_id
  AND shift_times.dow = DAYOFWEEK(t.created)
  AND TIME(t.created) BETWEEN shift_times.start AND shift_times.end)
) t
LEFT JOIN shifts_users su ON t.shift_id = su.shift_id
LEFT JOIN shift_positions ON su.shift_position_id = shift_positions.id
WHERE shift_positions.level = 1
</code></pre>

<p>This query takes over an hour to run on a schema that has > 1.7 million tickets. This is unacceptable for the maintenance window I have. Also, it doesn't even handle calculating the manager_resolved field, as attempting to combine that into the same query pushes the query time into the stratosphere. My current inclination is to keep them separate, and use an UPDATE to populate the manager_resolved field, but I'm not sure. </p>

<p>First, I knew the query I was trying was suffering because of the huge derived table, and the subsequent JOINs onto this. I was taking my well-indexed tickets table and joining all the shift_times data onto it, then letting MySQL chew on that while it attempts to join the shifts and shift_positions table. This derived behemoth would be up to a 2 million row unindexed mess.</p>

<p>Now, I knew this was happening. The reason I was going down this road though was because the ""proper"" way to do this, using strictly JOINs was taking an even longer amount of time. This is due to the nasty bit of chaos required to determine who the manager of a given shift is. I have to join down to shift_times to find out what the correct shift even is, while simultaneously joining down to shift_positions to figure out the user's level. I don't think the MySQL optimizer handles this very well, and ends up creating a HUGE monstrosity of a temporary table of the joins, then filtering out what doesn't apply.</p>

<p>So, as the derived table seemed to be the ""way to go"" I stubbornly persisted in this for a while. I tried punting it down into a JOIN clause, no improvement. I tried creating a temporary table with the derived table in it, but again it was too slow as the temp table was unindexed. </p>

<p>I came to realize that I had to handle this calculation of shift, times, positions sanely. I thought, maybe a VIEW would be the way to go. What if I created a VIEW that contained this information: (shop_id, shift_id, dow, start, end, manager_id). Then, I would simply have to join the tickets table by shop_id and the whole DAYOFWEEK/TIME calculation, and I'd be in business. Of course, I failed to remember that MySQL handles VIEWs rather assily. It doesn't materialize them at all, it simply runs the query you would have used to get the view for you. So by joining tickets onto this, I was essentially running my original query - no improvement.</p>

<p>So, instead of a VIEW I decided to use a TEMPORARY TABLE. This worked well if I only fetched one of the managers (created or resolved) at a time, but it was still pretty slow. Also, I found out that with MySQL you can't refer to the same table twice in the same query (I would have to join my temporary table twice to be able to differentiate between manager_created and manager_resolved). This is a big WTF, as I can do it as long as I don't specify ""TEMPORARY"" - this is where the CREATE TABLE magic ENGINE=MEMORY came into play. </p>

<p>With this pseudo temporary table in hand, I tried my JOIN for just manager_created again. It performed well, but still rather slow. Yet, when I JOINed again to get manager_resolved in the same query the query time ticked back up into the stratosphere. Looking at the EXPLAIN showed the full table scan of tickets (rows ~2mln), as expected, and the JOINs onto the magic table at ~2,087 each. Again, I seemed to be running into fail.</p>

<p>I now began to think about how to avoid the JOINs altogether and that's when I found some obscure ancient message board post where someone suggested using subselects (can't find the link in my history). This is what led to the second SELECT query shown above (the tickets_extra creation one). In the case of selecting just a single manager field, it performed well, but again with both it was crap. I looked at the EXPLAIN and saw this:</p>

<pre><code>*************************** 1. row ***************************
           id: 1
  select_type: PRIMARY
        table: t
         type: ALL
possible_keys: NULL
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 173825
        Extra: 
*************************** 2. row ***************************
           id: 3
  select_type: DEPENDENT SUBQUERY
        table: m
         type: ALL
possible_keys: NULL
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 2037
        Extra: Using where
*************************** 3. row ***************************
           id: 2
  select_type: DEPENDENT SUBQUERY
        table: m
         type: ALL
possible_keys: NULL
          key: NULL
      key_len: NULL
          ref: NULL
         rows: 2037
        Extra: Using where
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>Ack, the dreaded DEPENDENT SUBQUERY. It's often suggested to avoid these, as MySQL will usually execute them in an outside-in fashion, executing the inner query for every row of the outer. I ignored this, and wondered: ""Well... what if I just indexed this stupid magic table?"". Thus, the ADD index (shop_id, dow) was born.</p>

<p>Check this out:</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; CREATE TABLE magic ENGINE=MEMORY
&lt;snip&gt;
Query OK, 3220 rows affected (0.40 sec)

mysql&gt; ALTER TABLE magic ADD INDEX (shop_id, dow);
Query OK, 3220 rows affected (0.02 sec)

mysql&gt; CREATE TABLE tickets_extra ENGINE=MyISAM
&lt;snip&gt;
Query OK, 1933769 rows affected (24.18 sec)

mysql&gt; drop table magic;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
</code></pre>

<p>Now <strong>THAT'S</strong> what I'm talkin' about!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is definitely the first time I've created a non-TEMPORARY table on the fly, and INDEXed it on the fly, simply to do a single query efficiently. I guess I always assumed that adding an index on the fly is a prohibitively expensive operation. (Adding an index on my tickets table of 2mln rows can take over an hour). Yet, for a mere 3,000 rows this is a cakewalk.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid of DEPENDENT SUBQUERIES, creating TEMPORARY tables that really aren't, indexing on the fly, or aliens. They can all be good things in the right situation.</p>

"1182818","<p>I'm currently revisiting an area of my Windows-based software and looking at changing the relationship from 1->M to M->M. As a result, I need to adjust the UI to accommodate selecting multiple related records.</p>

<p>There are a lot of ways to handle this that are common, but usually pretty clunky. Examples include the two-pane list of all items, and list of selected items, or a list of all records and a checkbox beside each one that applies.</p>

<p>In my case, there may be an awful lot (in the tens of thousands) of records that could be associated, so I'll probably need to include some kind of search mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>I'm not looking for a hard and fast answer</strong> -- I can implement something pretty easily that's functional, I'm looking to see if anyone here has come up with (or seen) any great UIs for doing this kind of thing, whether it's web based, Windows, Mac, Unix, whatever.</p>

<p>Images or links to them would be appreciated!</p>

<p>Edit: here's an example of what I'm considering:</p>

 </p>

<p><sub><em>Items are displayed as user types</em></sub></p>

<ol>
<li><p>You start obviously with the record you want to associate multiple items with.</p></li>
<li><p>As you type the search displays the matches ( no need to press on ""Search"" ) </p></li>
<li><p>The user select the desired record ( Sorting would be nice. SO uses ""tag relevance"".  For instance typing 'a' brings Java rather than asp because Java has more questions than asp,  in your case relevance may be the user name ) </p></li>
<li><p>The system creates the relationship ( in memory ) </p></li>
<li><p>If a number of records (  5+  ) are filling the input field, they are moved into a semi-regid area ( not a SO problem because it only has 5 tag withing a single question, but in your case something like the ""interesting tags"" feature would be needed ) </p></li>
</ol>

</p>

<p><sub><em>Associated items are moved to a ""rigid"" area</em></sub></p>

<p>Of course in an ordered manner ( using a table ) </p>

<ul>
<li>Finally when the user end with the association it clicks SAVE or CANCEL buttons.</li>
</ul>

<p>This approach has more efficiency by not needing to have the user press on ""search"" or ""add other""  which distracts them from what they're doing, it is being said it interrupts its train of thought. </p>

<p>Also, if you make the user grab the mouse to click on something while they are typing the UI is less efficient ( I think there is something called the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hick%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hick's law</a> about that, but quite frankly I may be wrong ) </p>

<p>As you see this approach is pretty much already what you have in mind, but adding some facilities to make the user happier ( The danger would be if the user loves this approach and wants it in other parts of the system ) </p>

<p>I was having successful builds but Netbeans was unable to launch my executable. I was able to verify that the executable was being built and I could run it from an external command prompt. I was also unable to open the properties on my project.</p>

<p>After a day of searching the net, I found a tidbit of info that lead to the solution.</p>

<p>Basically, it all boiled down to not having the path to my build tools set in the windows environment path. After I set the path environment variable, I cleared all the Netbeans configuration so I could be sure about setting things up from scratch. You can do this by deleting the .netbeans folder in your user directory in c:/Documents and Settings.</p>

<p>That should all be done with Netbeans closed of course. Afterwards, start it up and setup your build configuration before you create any projects or load existing projects. Go to Tools/Options/C++ and point it at the build tools directory you added to your environment path (c:/MinGW/bin and c:/msys/1.0/bin) and the individual tools as required.</p>

<p>I have my msys stuff in the same directory as the MinGW stuff. As an extra precaution, you may want to make sure there are no same named programs in both bin directories that may cause grief.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It could be that IE6/7 can't handle the HTML5 section tag. I say this because when I change step 4 from <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, IE6/7 will start working.</p>

<li><p>If I use <code>document.createElement()</code> and create my new element, it works, but it seems like jQuery's <code>append()</code> has a problem with html5 elements.</p>

IE now sees the unknown elements as two new broken elements, i.e. <code>&lt;article&gt;content&lt;/article&gt;</code> is seen as <code>ARTICLE</code>, <code>#text</code>, <code>/ARTICLE</code>, caused by innerHTML borking.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/rI36D.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I know that the shape was originally a rectangle, but I do not know its original size.</p>

<p>If I know the pixel coordinates of the corners in this picture, how can I calculate the original proportions, i.e. the quotient ( width / height ) of the rectangle?</p>

<p>(background: the goal is to automatically undistort photos of rectangular documents, edge detection will probably be done with hough transform)</p>

<h1>UPDATE:</h1>

<p>There has been some discussion on whether it is possible at all to determine the width:height ratio with the information given. My naive thought was that it must be possible, since I can think of no way to project for example a 1:4 rectangle onto the quadrangle depicted above. The ratio appears clearly close to 1:1, so there should be a way to determine it mathematically. I have however no proof for this beyond my intuitive guess.</p>

<p>I have not yet fully understood the arguments presented below, but I think there must be some implicit assumption that we are missing here and that is interpreted differently.</p>

<p>However, after hours of searching, I have finally found some papers relevant to the problem.
I am struggling to understand the math used in there, so far without success. Particularly the first paper seems to discuss exactly what I wanted to do, unfortunately without code examples and very dense math.</p>

<pre><code>
// in case it matters: licensed under GPLv2 or later
// legend:
// sqr(x)  = x*x
// sqrt(x) = square root of x

// let m1x,m1y ... m4x,m4y be the (x,y) pixel coordinates
// of the 4 corners of the detected quadrangle
// i.e. (m1x, m1y) are the cordinates of the first corner, 
// (m2x, m2y) of the second corner and so on.
// let u0, v0 be the pixel coordinates of the principal point of the image
// for a normal camera this will be the center of the image, 
// i.e. u0=IMAGEWIDTH/2; v0 =IMAGEHEIGHT/2
// This assumption does not hold if the image has been cropped asymmetrically

// first, transform the image so the principal point is at (0,0)
// this makes the following equations much easier
m1x = m1x - u0;
m1y = m1y - v0;
m2x = m2x - u0;
m2y = m2y - v0;
m3x = m3x - u0;
m3y = m3y - v0;
m4x = m4x - u0;
m4y = m4y - v0;


// temporary variables k2, k3
double k2 = ((m1y - m4y)*m3x - (m1x - m4x)*m3y + m1x*m4y - m1y*m4x) /
            ((m2y - m4y)*m3x - (m2x - m4x)*m3y + m2x*m4y - m2y*m4x) ;

double k3 = ((m1y - m4y)*m2x - (m1x - m4x)*m2y + m1x*m4y - m1y*m4x) / 
            ((m3y - m4y)*m2x - (m3x - m4x)*m2y + m3x*m4y - m3y*m4x) ;

// f_squared is the focal length of the camera, squared
// if k2==1 OR k3==1 then this equation is not solvable
// if the focal length is known, then this equation is not needed
// in that case assign f_squared= sqr(focal_length)
double f_squared = 
    -((k3*m3y - m1y)*(k2*m2y - m1y) + (k3*m3x - m1x)*(k2*m2x - m1x)) / 
                      ((k3 - 1)*(k2 - 1)) ;

//The width/height ratio of the original rectangle
double whRatio = sqrt( 
    (sqr(k2 - 1) + sqr(k2*m2y - m1y)/f_squared + sqr(k2*m2x - m1x)/f_squared) /
    (sqr(k3 - 1) + sqr(k3*m3y - m1y)/f_squared + sqr(k3*m3x - m1x)/f_squared) 
) ;

// if k2==1 AND k3==1, then the focal length equation is not solvable 
// but the focal length is not needed to calculate the ratio.
// I am still trying to figure out under which circumstances k2 and k3 become 1
// but it seems to be when the rectangle is not distorted by perspective, 
// i.e. viewed straight on. Then the equation is obvious:
if (k2==1 && k3==1) whRatio = sqrt( 
    (sqr(m2y-m1y) + sqr(m2x-m1x)) / 
    (sqr(m3y-m1y) + sqr(m3x-m1x))


// After testing, I found that the above equations 
// actually give the height/width ratio of the rectangle, 
// not the width/height ratio. 
// If someone can find the error that caused this, 
// I would be most grateful.
// until then:
whRatio = 1/whRatio;

"1200067","<p>[Sorry for long question but it is necessary to explain the problem]</p>

<p>I am working on a learning website and it is supposed to show a list of messages to user if there are any. Something like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/AP9li.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/AP9li.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>When user presses close button, that message must be marked ""read"" and should not be shown next time. Following code is used to generate those messages:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% foreach (var m in Model.UserMessages) { %&gt;
    &lt;div class=""um"" id=""m&lt;%=Html.AttributeEncode(m.ID) %&gt;""&gt;
        &lt;p class=""mh""&gt;&lt;%= Html.Encode (String.Format (""From {0} ({1})"", m.From, m.Sent)) %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= Html.Encode (m.Text) %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;% using (Html.BeginForm (""CloseMessage"", ""Home"", new { id = m.ID })) { %&gt;
            &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Close&lt;%= Html.AttributeEncode (m.ID) %&gt;"" id=""c&lt;%= Html.AttributeEncode (m.ID) %&gt;""/&gt;
        &lt;% } %&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;% } %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After that, following the guidelines, I added the support of http post method in controller which marks the message as read and then refreshes the view (to handle disabled JavaScript):</p>

<pre><code>[AcceptVerbs(HttpVerbs.Post)]
public ActionResult CloseMessage (int id) {
    using (var dl = new DL ()) {
        dl.MarkAsRead (id);
    }

    if (Request.IsAjaxRequest ()) {
        return new EmptyResult ();
    }
    else {
        return RedirectToAction (""Index"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then I wanted to add JavaScript support such that only the message goes away (using jQuery). But the problem is that I am generating the buttons and messages programmatically.</p>

<p>So ended up with a weird looking javascript code in viewpage:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    $().ready(function() {
        &lt;% foreach (var m in Model.UserMessages) { %&gt;
        $(""#c&lt;%=Html.AttributeEncode (m.ID) %&gt;"").click(function(event) {
            $.post(""Home/CloseMessage/&lt;%=Html.AttributeEncode (m.ID) %&gt;"");
            $(""#m&lt;%=Html.AttributeEncode (m.ID) %&gt;"").slideUp(""slow"");
            event.preventDefault();
        });
        &lt;% } %&gt;
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This is basically creating the javascript code in a C# loop which actually works but too much for me to digest. Is there any better way of doing this?</p>

}

<p>Is it possible for Java to have a corrupt or missing CA cert? If so how can I repair or resolve this issue/error?</p>

<p><strong>Things I've Tried:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I have removed all versions of JRE from the PC and installed the latest version of JRE (1.6.14).</li>
<li>Cleaned and removed all unnecessary Trusted Cert's from the User section of Certificates.</li>
<li>Try running keytool to get the fingerprints of the CA's</li>
</ol>

<p>When trying to run the keytool I'm getting the following:</p>

<p><strong>keytool error: java.security.cert.CertificateParsingException: java.io.IOException: subject key, java.security.spec.InvalidKeySpecException: Unknown key spec.</strong></p>
","Could not find trusted certificate","<java><ssl-certificate><certificate-authority>","2009-07-29 19:35:16","5943","1204092","1","<p>It is theoretically possible, but IMO highly unlikely, that Java has a corrupt CA cert.  It is more likely that the CA cert you want is not in the JRE's cacerts store.  You can check on the contents of the store (on Linux at least) using 'keytool'; e.g.</p>

<pre><code>keytool -list -keystore /usr/java/jdk1.6.0_14/jre/lib/security/cacerts
</code></pre>

<p>Scan through that listing to see if you can see the fingerprint for the CAcert that your URL requires.</p>

","Twitter Trending Topics: Combine different spellings","<twitter><tags><spelling>","2009-07-29 22:41:13","1280","1242016","7","<p>I'll try to answer my own question based on Broken Link's comment (thank you for this):</p>

<hr>

<p>You've extracted phrases consisting of 1 to 3 words from your database of documents. Among these extraced phrases there are the following phrases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Half Blood Prince</li>
<li>Half-Blood Prince</li>
<li>Halfblood Prince</li>
</ul>

<p>For each phrase, you strip all special characters and blank spaces and make the string lowercase:</p>

<p>$phrase = 'Half Blood Prince';
$phrase = preg_replace('/[^a-z]/i', '', $phrase);
$phrase = strtolower($phrase);
// result is ""halfbloodprince""</p>

<p>When you've done this, all 3 phrases (see above) have one spelling in common:</p>

<ul>
<li>Half Blood Prince => halfbloodprince</li>
<li>Half-Blood Prince => halfbloodprince</li>
<li>Halfblood Prince => halfbloodprince</li>
</ul>

<p>So ""halfbloodprince"" is the parent phrase. You insert both into your database, the normal phrase and the parent phrase.</p>

<p>To show a ""Trending Topics Admin"" like Twitter's you do the following:</p>

<pre><code>// first select the top 10 parent phrases
$sql1 = ""SELECT parentPhrase, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM phrases GROUP BY parentPhrase ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 0, 10"";
$sql2 = mysql_query($sql1);
while ($sql3 = mysql_fetch_assoc($sql2)) {
    $parentPhrase = $sql3['parentPhrase'];
    $childPhrases = array(); // set up an array for the child phrases
    $fifthPart = round($sql3['cnt']*0.2);
    // now select all child phrases which make 20% of the parent phrase or more
    $sql4 = ""SELECT phrase FROM phrases WHERE parentPhrase = '"".$sql3['parentPhrase'].""' GROUP BY phrase HAVING COUNT(*) &gt;= "".$fifthPart;
    $sql5 = mysql_query($sql4);
    while ($sql6 = mysql_fetch_assoc($sql5)) {
        $childPhrases[] = $sql3['phrase'];
    }
    // now you have the parent phrase which is on the left side of the arrow in $parentPhrase
    // and all child phrases which are on the right side of the arrow in $childPhrases
}

<p>I think it worth mentioning that <del>the previous answer by streetpc has invalid html, the doctype is XHTML and there are single quotes around the attributes. Also worth noting is that</del> you dont need an extra element with <code>clear</code> on in order to clear the internal floats of the container. If you use overflow hidden this clears the floats in all non-IE browsers and then just adding something to give hasLayout such as width or zoom:1 will cause IE to clear its internal floats.</p>
<p>I have tested this in all modern browsers FF3+ Opera9+ Chrome Safari 3+ and IE6/7/8. It may seem like an ugly trick but it works well and I use it in production a lot.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/cSTWr.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I have a set of controls related to each other as the above figure shows. It includes several treeviews, a split bar, a listview, a subform( a usercontrol), and etc.</p>

<p>When I click or change the treeview nodes in the left, the right controls will change their display accordingly, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The data behind the scene is maintained in an Access database.</p>

<p>This set of data management and display is used in several different applications. So I wrote several classes to implement the logic and include these classes modules again and again in my applications.</p>

<p>So I am actually <strong>REUSE</strong> my classes in a ""copy and paste"" mode. It works but it have problems. If I make a change in a class, I have to change it in several applications.</p>

<p>These days I am thinking about making them into the so-called ActiveX components. But I am not sure which kind of ActiveX components should I develop to reuse the whole architecture.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, I want to know <strong>how can I reuse it more gracefully</strong> than just ""copy and paste"". Below is some ideas or expectation of the new ""graceful REUSE"", but not confine to them.</p>

<p>(1) I hope it looks like an ActiveX control which has a property page so that I can set some properties of it during design time.</p>

<p>(2) For different applications, the subform in the right may display different information and has different controls and may need extra coding and designing.</p>

<p>(3) Also I may need to code some new behaviour for the treeview and listview for different applications. This requirement make a whole usercontrol for the whole form not suitable. because MSDN said “References to ActiveX controls，should never be returned to client applications。""</p>

<li>Create a ActiveX DLL (not control)</li>
<li>Define a Interface for the form in<br>
the DLL</li>
<li>Move all your logic into one or more class in the DLL
and have the routines interact with the form through the interface</li>
<li>Implement the Interface in the form</li>
<li>One initialization of the app have the form register itself with the ActiveX DLL</li>
</ul>

<p>This will effectively eliminate copy and paste between the different apps. </p>

<p>For example for my metal cutting application I have a Shape Form, a Shape Screen class, and a bunch of shape classes. Two of the methods of the shape class are DrawScreen which has a parameters of type ShapeScreen, and GetValues which also has a parameter of type ShapeScreen. </p>

<p>DrawScreen uses the method of ShapeScreen to setup the entry screen and Shape Screen setup the Form through the IShapeForm interface. The GetValues uses Shape Screen methods to get the entered shape values which in turns uses the IShapeForm to get the values from the form.</p>

<p>This setup proved useful when we had to develop different shape entry forms in response to customer requests. The new form just implemented the IShapeForm interface and the rest of the software was untouched.</p>

"1210735","<p>I have been trying to position content within a table row. The row in question in turn contains 2 other tables and 1 small thumbnail image (each within a table cell of course). The row was positioned using <code>valign=""top""</code> till now. This worked well getting contents of all the three columns to the top.</p>

<p>However, I wanted to position it using CSS <code>position:relative; vertical-align:text-top;</code></p>

<p>This positions the cell content well <strong>if there is no thumbnail image</strong>. However, once the image is included, the other columns are not positioned at all. See the image below.</p>

<p>I've aligned the bigger text to fit nicely (vertically-aligned) within my input box using padding, but the little blinking text cursor is terribly aligned (hugs the bottom). I'm wondering if there is a way to adjust the blinking text cursor on its own without messing up the positioning of the text.</p>

<p>You're specifying a height of 32px, but any padding gets added to that, so the height of your input box is actually 32 + 9 + 4 = 45px. The cursor is being vertically centered in the 45px tall input box, but your border is around the 32px tall div. Change 'height: 32px' to 'height: 19px' on the search input and it works.</p>

"1212860","<p>I'm adding css-based tab navigation to a site that is still using table-based layout. When I place my tab list inside a td, there is a visual ""gap"" that you can see. If I put an empty div with width: 100% in the td, then my tab list displays correctly. (It also works fine outside the table.)</p>

<p>Why does the div make the tabs lay out correctly, and is there a better way to make them do so without adding a content-free div?</p>

                &lt;tr&gt;
                &lt;td  &gt;
                &lt;div style=""width: 100%""&gt;&lt;!-- This div forces the menu to render properly in IE7. I don't know why --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

                &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;

                    why? The difference is the presence of a div with style=""width: 100%"" on it in the second 
                    case. I don't know why this fixes the rendering; I'd like a better way to do it without adding an 
                    extra empty div. This page should be in standards mode (or at least non-quirks mode).

                    &lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;/table&gt;

            For comparison, it works fine outside of a table:

                        &lt;ul class=""tabnav""&gt;
                            &lt;li class=""current""&gt;&lt;a &gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                            &lt;li &gt;&lt;a &gt;Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;/ul&gt;

Since <code>ul</code> tags can only contain <code>&lt;li&gt;</code>s, IE apparently also believes the whitespace between the list items is inappropriate and moves it inside the preceding list item, in your case following the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>That then causes the white background of the selected tab to overlap the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>s bottom border (due to its positioning).</p>

<p>It looks like the easiest way to solve it in this example is simply to remove the background color on <code>ul.tabnav li.current</code>. In fact, I think you can remove that entire ruleset, since the border doesn't do anything either.</p>

<hr>

<p>If none of that helps you fix it on the actual site, a last resort could be to get rid of all whitespace outside the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tags. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>or something like this if you want to retain some semblance of formatting:</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;ul&gt;&lt;!--
   --&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;!--
   --&gt;&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;!--
   --&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But that whitespace is also all that's responsible for the spacing between the tabs, so you'd have to add a right margin to bring it back.</p>

<p>Here's a picture of the current state of my picker.</p>

<p>The wells surrounding the color wheel are NSColorWell subclasses. They are instantiated programmatically and added to the color wheel view (an NSView subclass) by calling addSubView on the color wheel class.</p>

<p>I want to make it so that you can drag the color wells around by their grab handles. The start of that journey is making the cursor change to an open hand when the mouse hovers over the handles. Sadly, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1211277/why-shouldnt-i-use-a-cursor-rect-on-a-rotated-nsview-subclass"">I can't use a cursor rect for this because most of my views are rotated</a>. I must therefore use mouseMoved events and do the hit detection myself.</p>

<p>Here's the mouse event code I'm trying to make work:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)mouseMoved:(NSEvent*)event
{
    NSLog(@""I am over here!\n"");

    [super mouseMoved:event];

    NSPoint eventPoint = [self convertPoint:[event locationInWindow] fromView:nil];
    BOOL isInHandle = [grabHandle containsPoint:eventPoint];
    if (isInHandle &amp;&amp; [NSCursor currentCursor] != [NSCursor openHandCursor])  {
        [[NSCursor openHandCursor] push];
    }
    else if (!isInHandle)  [NSCursor pop];
}

- (void)mouseEntered:(NSEvent*)event
{
    [[self window] setAcceptsMouseMovedEvents:YES];
}
- (void)mouseExited:(NSEvent*)event
{
    [[self window] setAcceptsMouseMovedEvents:NO];
    [NSCursor pop];
}

- (BOOL)acceptsFirstResponder
{
    return YES;
}
- (BOOL)resignFirstResponder
{
    return YES;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I find that my mouseMoved method is never called. Ditto for entered and exited. However, when I implement mouseDown, that one <em>does</em> get called, so at least some events are getting to me, just not the ones I want.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Thanks!</p>

The relevant methods are <code>-addTrackingRect:owner:userData:assumeInside:</code> and <code>-removeTrackingRect:</code>.  Just pass <code>[self bounds]</code> for the first parameter if you want your whole view to be tracked.  If your app is 10.5+ only, you should probably use NSTrackingArea instead as it directly supports getting mouse-moved events only inside the tracking area.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that 1) tracking rects have the same somewhat odd behavior as cursor rects w/r/t rotated views, and 2) if your bounds change (not merely your frame) you'll probably need to re-establish your tracking rect, so save the tracking rect's tag to remove it later.</p>

"1219827","<p>I working on a simple paint program.
It seemed Qt (and KDE) would be a easy way to implement it.
I find Qt quite easy to work with, but now I have hit a problem.</p>

<p>When I draw something in my program the mouse skips if I move the mouse to fast.</p>

<p>like this:<br>

It susposed to be like one long string.</p>

<p>I'm using mouseMoveEvent() to draw a pixel to my image when the left mouse button is pressed down.
I have called setMouseTracking(true); so the event should be called as long as I move the mouse.</p>

<pre><code>void camoMaker::mouseMoveEvent(QMouseEvent *ev)
{
    if(ev-&gt;state()==Qt::LeftButton)

<p>camoMaker is the main widget.<br>
drawPoint() draws a pixel on both a internal QImage and using QPainter on a QWidget thats the drawing area.</p>

<p>It seems to me that either mouseMoveEvent() isn't called for every pixel the mouse moves or that the mouse actually just skips some pixel.</p>

<p>I understand that it might just how it works and not Qt fault but X11 or how the OS handle mouse position/input.</p>

<p>If so how would I go about to fix it, should I try to interpolate from 2 points that gets registered?</p>

<p>Right now it animates everything at once (the keyboard never disappears, it just changes its look, and the new view modally animates on, seemingly underneath the keyboard). The whole effect functions properly, but it's a bit herky-jerky, and I think sliding the keyboard off prior to popping the modal view on screen would be smoother. I have seen other applications do what I want (things, for example) so I know it's possible.</p>

<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction on making each of the transitions happen individually, rather than all at once?</p>

"1220879","<p>My main question is how to copy a whole database having a English collation to one having a Greek collation? The source database is having all the tables and the related data. I have a clean Greek collation database. I want to copy <strong><em>everything</em></strong> from source to destination.</p>

<p>One <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/325335"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">solution</a> that I found in a KB article, consisted of the following steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Generating scripts for all the objects (not including the indexes, the triggers, the primary keys, the foreign keys, the default settings, and the constraints) in the source database. Here, the <code>Script collation</code> setting was set to <code>False</code>, so the scripts were created <strong>without</strong> the <code>collate</code> keyword.</li>
<li>Running the scripts from step 1 on the destination database to create the objects with the destination database collation.</li>
<li>Using DTS to transfer the data from the source database. This is where I am stuck right now.</li>
</ul>

<p>I used the <code>Export Data...</code> wizard of SQL Server 2005 for exporting data from source to destination database. I am having approximately 1500 tables in my database, so I ticked the <code>Optimize of many tables</code> checkbox in the wizard step. Apart from that, all the settings were default.</p>

<p>I got an <a href=""http://kirtangor.googlepages.com/ssis-error-report.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">error (text-file containing the report)</a> while executing the export.</p>

<p>For moving ahead, either I need a solution to this error, or a new way to copy from source to destination database with a different collation.</p>

<h2>EDIT 1</h2>

<p>I forgot to mention that I've already tried to use SQL Compare. I have been using that tool since very long. But it won't help a bit in this situation. I am having tables with <code>Latin1_General_CS_AS</code> collation in the source database, but I DON'T want to create the tables with that collation. I know there's an option to <code>Ignore Collation</code>. But then, there's another problem with column names - some column names are weird, and SQL Compare introduces extra <code>[</code> or <code>]</code> characters while formatting column names, which breaks the WHOLE sync script!</p>

<p>The slow upwards crawl of memory usage is caused by the allocation of lots and lots of small, simple, transient objects. In low-memory situations (This is a mobile app) the GC overhead is noticeable when compared to less restrictive memory amounts.</p>

<p>Since we know, due to the nature of the app, that these spikes will just keep on coming, I was considering some sort of pool of multitudinous transient objects (Awesome name). These objects would live for the lifetime of the app and be re-used wherever possible (Where the lifetime of the object is short and highly predictable).</p>

<p>Hopefully this would mitigate against the effects of GC by reducing the number of objects collected and improve performance.</p>

<p>Obviously this would also have its own performance limits since ""allocation"" would be more expensive and there would be an overhead in maintaining the cache itself.</p>

<p>Since this would be a rather large and intrusive change into a large amount of code, I was wondering if anyone had tried something similar and if it was a benefit, or if there were any other known ways of mitigating against GC in this sort of situation. Ideas for efficient ways to manage a cache of re-usable objects are also welcome.</p>

So if the JVms you are using cannot have their GC behavioure modified, then old-fashioned object pooling may be the best solution.</p>

<p>The Apache Commons Pool library is good for that, although if this is a mobile app, then you may not want the library dependency overhead.</p>

"1234764","<p>So I'm working on a project that will, in the end, generate a kind of flow chart using the Flickr api. You will supply a seed tag, and the program will use that seed tag to find other related Flickr pictures that have common tags... </p>

<p>I have all of the back end stuff up and running but I'm stumped on the formatting. Here is a screenie of what I would like it to look like...</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ykHFd.jpg"" alt=""Cool Screenie""></p>

<p>Here's my question. Is there a good way of approaching the spacing of each branch? By this is mean, I would like to have a function where I could simply create a new node (or ""branch"") and specify which existing node I would like it to attach to. This is all good and fine, but I need to be able to automatically and intelligently place the new node on the page so it doesn't overlap any existing lines or nodes. I guess this is more of a general programming question as if I knew the process I could code it, but for those who are interested I am doing this in Javascript/HTML/CSS for the styling and maybe some PHP for the Flickr calls. </p>

<p>Feel free to ask any questions to clarify my rambling.</p>
","Automatic Spacing for Flowchart","<javascript><logic><flickr>","2009-08-05 17:58:50","598","1234870","2","<p>You could use a spring model between the nodes.  Each node exerts a repelling force against every other node.  Allow all the nodes to push against each other a certain number of times and you'll come up with a reasonable solution.  You'll want to have a couple limits to make sure nodes don't go flying off into space and that you don't oscillate between a couple similar states.</p>

<p>Implementing it in Javascript/PHP is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

<p>An alternative is to use a graph layout program such as <a href=""http://www.graphviz.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GraphViz</a>.</p>

"1235057","<p>I have this dilemma about designing/programming border or gap widths in an application of mine. I'm using Swing but this is sort of implementation-agnostic. I have a splitter pane (JXMultiSplitPane) dividing two subpanes, shown below outlined in black; the black border will be gone in the real application and is just here for debugging.</p>

<p>You'll note that there's a gap between the two subpanes. That's the splitter, and it needs to be wide enough to grap onto. You'll also notice the gap between each table and the black border. That's supposed to be there to add some reasonable space... except that if I remove the black borders, I now have a space between the two tables that looks 3x as wide as it should be.</p>

<p>My instinct is to get rid of the gap on the right side of the left-hand table, and the gap on the left side of the right hand table, so that the only gap is the splitter itself. Is this the right way to handle it? The only hesitation I have is that I may be giving the user the option to stack these vertically, so the actual border spacing of the left hand table needs to change (spacing adjacent to the splitter should be set to 0) and that seems weird....</p>

"1236473","<p>I want to use partially transparent images in drag/drop operations. This is all set up and works fine, but the actual transformation to transparency has a weird side effect. For some reason, the pixels seem to be blended against a black background. </p>

<p>The following image describes the problem:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/AEPKZ.png"" alt=""Transparency problem""></p>

<p>Figure a) is the original bitmap.</p>

<p>Figure b) is what is produced after alpha blending has been performed. Obviously this is a lot darker than the intended 50% alpha filter intended.</p>

<p>Figure c) is the desired effect, image a) with 50% transparency (added to the composition with a drawing program).</p>

<p>The code I use to produce the trasparent image is the following:</p>

<pre><code>Bitmap bmpNew = new Bitmap(bmpOriginal.Width, bmpOriginal.Height);
Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(bmpNew);

// Making the bitmap 50% transparent:
float[][] ptsArray ={ 
    new float[] {1, 0, 0, 0, 0},        // Red
    new float[] {0, 1, 0, 0, 0},        // Green
    new float[] {0, 0, 1, 0, 0},        // Blue
    new float[] {0, 0, 0, 0.5f, 0},     // Alpha
    new float[] {0, 0, 0, 0, 1}         // Brightness
};
ColorMatrix clrMatrix = new ColorMatrix(ptsArray);
ImageAttributes imgAttributes = new ImageAttributes();
imgAttributes.SetColorMatrix(clrMatrix, ColorMatrixFlag.Default, ColorAdjustType.Bitmap);
g.DrawImage(bmpOriginal, new Rectangle(0, 0, bmpOriginal.Width, bmpOriginal.Height), 0, 0, bmpOriginal.Width, bmpOriginal.Height, GraphicsUnit.Pixel, imgAttributes);
Cursors.Default.Draw(g, new Rectangle(bmpOriginal.Width / 2 - 8, bmpOriginal.Height / 2 - 8, 32, 32));
g.Dispose();
imgAttributes.Dispose();
return bmpNew;
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone know why the alpha blending does not work?</p>

<p><strong>Update I:</strong></p>

<p>For clarity, the code does work if I'm alphablending on top of a drawn surface. The problem is that I want to create a completely semitransparent image from an existing image and use this as a dynamic cursor during drag/drop operations. Even skipping the above and only painting a filled rectangle of color 88ffffff yields a dark grey color. Something fishy is going on with the icon.</p>

<p><strong>Update II:</strong></p>

<p>Since I've reseached a whole lot and believe this has got something to do with the Cursor creation, I'm gonna include that code below too. If I GetPixel-sample the bitmap just before the CreateIconIndirect call, the four color values seem to be intact. Thus I have a feeling the culprits might be the hbmColor or the hbmMask members of the IconInfo structure.</p>

<p>Here's the IconInfo structure:</p>

<pre><code>public struct IconInfo {    // http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms648052(VS.85).aspx
    public bool fIcon;      // Icon or cursor. True = Icon, False = Cursor
    public int xHotspot;
    public int yHotspot;
    public IntPtr hbmMask;  // Specifies the icon bitmask bitmap. If this structure defines a black and white icon, 
                            // this bitmask is formatted so that the upper half is the icon AND bitmask and the lower 
                            // half is the icon XOR bitmask. Under this condition, the height should be an even multiple of two. 
                            // If this structure defines a color icon, this mask only defines the AND bitmask of the icon.
    public IntPtr hbmColor; // Handle to the icon color bitmap. This member can be optional if this structure defines a black 
                            // and white icon. The AND bitmask of hbmMask is applied with the SRCAND flag to the destination; 
                            // subsequently, the color bitmap is applied (using XOR) to the destination by using the SRCINVERT flag. 

}
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the code that actually creates the Cursor:</p>

<pre><code>    public static Cursor CreateCursor(Bitmap bmp, int xHotSpot, int yHotSpot) {
        IconInfo iconInfo = new IconInfo();
        GetIconInfo(bmp.GetHicon(), ref iconInfo);
        iconInfo.hbmColor = (IntPtr)0;
        iconInfo.hbmMask = bmp.GetHbitmap();
        iconInfo.xHotspot = xHotSpot;
        iconInfo.yHotspot = yHotSpot;
        iconInfo.fIcon = false;

        return new Cursor(CreateIconIndirect(ref iconInfo));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The two external functions are defined as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    [DllImport(""user32.dll"", EntryPoint = ""CreateIconIndirect"")]
    public static extern IntPtr CreateIconIndirect(ref IconInfo icon);

    [DllImport(""user32.dll"")]
    [return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.Bool)]
    public static extern bool GetIconInfo(IntPtr hIcon, ref IconInfo pIconInfo);

    IntPtr pixelData;
    IntPtr hBitmap = CreateDIBSection(
        IntPtr.Zero, bitmapInfo, 0, out pixelData, IntPtr.Zero, 0);

    Rectangle bounds = new Rectangle(0, 0, bitmap.Width, bitmap.Height);
    BitmapData bitmapData = bitmap.LockBits(
        bounds, ImageLockMode.ReadOnly, PixelFormat.Format32bppArgb );
    RtlMoveMemory(
        pixelData, bitmapData.Scan0, bitmap.Height * bitmapData.Stride);

    bitmap.UnlockBits(bitmapData);
    return hBitmap;

<p>I have an article that I want to publish on my Joomla! site. Every time I click apply or save. I get error <code>500 - An error has occurred! DB function reports no errors</code>. I have no idea why this error comes up, al I can think is that it's a server error. </p>

<p>at the top of the index.php pages for Joomla! but it does not show any errors. I checked the error logs on the server and also no errors come up. </p>

<p>I managed to publish the article via phpMyAdmin but then something else happens. I try to access to article from the front end, by clicking on the link to the article, but only a blank page comes up.</p>

<p>This is really weird, since the error log does not show any information. So I assume the error needs to be coming from Joomla!</p>

<p>I actually have two questions, I found the answer to the second and didn't update the diagram. I'm not actually sure if these are possible, they really stumped me.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1:</strong>
Given point A and e, the angle of the line A is on relative to the x-axis where 0&lt;=e&lt;360 degrees, how do you calculate the coordinates of B? BA is perpendicular to A's line and 1 unit long.</p>

<p>SOLVED: I start by taking the unit vector from a parallel to the x-axis and then I rotate it 90 + e degrees.</p>

<p><strong>Question 2:</strong>
I'm using <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1211212/how-to-calculate-an-angle-from-three-points"">this</a> approach. If anyone has any better suggestions, please let me know.</p>

<p>SOLVED: I find the dot product of the vector from step 1 and the normalized vector AC.</p>

<p><strong>Question 3:</strong>
This one should be pretty self-explanatory from the diagram. I need to find the coordinates of C given A, B, the angle of BAC and the distance between A and C.</p>

<p>SOLVED: I rotate BA e degrees and then change the magnitude to d.</p>

"1254356","<p>I'm recently working on a tree structure, multiple nodes, multiple and increasable levels, and a print() method.
At first, i thought it should be a Composite, i then wrote down some possible design and codes:</p>

<p><img src=""https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2596/3807730874_4d6d5ed7ee_o_d.gif"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<pre><code>$struc = new Node(‘name0’, ‘id0’, ‘desc0’);
$node1 = new Node(‘node1’, ‘id1’, ‘desc1’);
$node2 = new Node(‘node2’, ‘id2’, ‘desc2’);
$node3 = new Node(‘node3’, ‘id3’, ‘desc3’);
$leaf1 = new Leaf(‘leaf1’, ‘ld1’, ‘lesc1’);
$leaf2 = new Leaf(‘leaf2’, ‘ld2’, ‘lesc2’);
$leaf3 = new Leaf(‘leaf3’, ‘ld3’, ‘lesc3’);
$leaf4 = new Leaf(‘leaf4’, ‘ld4’, ‘lesc4’);

$struc.add($node1);
$struc.add($node3);

$node1.add($leaf1);
$node1.add($leaf2);
$node1.add($node2);

$node2.add($leaf3);    
$node3.add($leaf4);
</code></pre>

<p>Looks good, i think and begin coding, print() method may follow Iterator pattern later.
But during coding, i feel is it too complex for these simple nodes? And i have to instantiate a lot of concrete classes (more than 50+, and increasing). I then stopped and thinking a simple similar way by using array:</p>

<pre><code>-- Structure Class --
//To be more readable and clear, array here could be
//divided to 3 arrays(root/nodes/leafs), then connect
//in a similar way Composite does.
$struc = array('name0', 'id0', 'desc0',

           'children'=&gt;array(

               array('node1', 'id1', 'desc1',
                  'children' =&gt; array(
                     array('leaf1', 'ld1', 'lesc1'),
                     array('leaf2', 'ld2', 'lesc2'),
                     array('node2', 'id2', 'desc2',
                        'children'=&gt;array(array('leaf3', 'ld3', 'lesc3'))
                     )
                  )
               ),

               array('node3', 'id3', 'desc3',
                  'children' =&gt; array(array('leaf4', 'ld4', 'lesc4'))
               )
           )
);

function print($node = $this-&gt;struct) {
    ...
    if(isset($node['children'])) $this-&gt;print($node['children']);
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>The two designs look very similar, now i'm a little confused, what's the value of Composite pattern, am i missed something important of this pattern?</p>
","What advantage will Composite pattern bring me over just Array?","<php><design-patterns>","2009-08-10 11:19:17","2197","1254445","3","<p>The point of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern"" rel=""noreferrer"">composite pattern</a> is to be able to treat a collection of objects as if it were a single object (e.g. for displaying it or writing it to a file). As you write yourself ""print() method may follow Iterator pattern later"" - well, the point of the composite pattern would be that you could call print() without having to worry about whether you're printing a single Component or have to iterate through an entire Tree.</p>

<p>But it looks as though you're unclear about object-oriented programming in general, since you're considering using nested arrays instead.

<p>Sure enough, casting the CGRect values to (int) for the view's frame worked perfectly. So as an example, if you wanted your text field to be centered vertically in the superview, you should use an (int) cast like this:</p>

<pre>
textFieldWidth = 300;
textFieldHeight = 31;
offsetX = 0;
offsetY = (superview.bounds.size.height - textFieldHeight) / 2;

textField.frame = CGRectMake((int) offsetX,

                             (int) textFieldWidth,

<p>I recommend against trying to customize the contents of an ActionSheet, as it can lead to serious invalid context errors in iOS 7. I just spent a few hours working through this problem and ultimately decided to take a different approach. I replaced the call to show the action sheet with a modal view controller containing a simple tableview. </p>

<p>There are many ways to accomplish this. Here's one way that I just implemented in a current project. It's nice because I can reuse it between 5 or 6 different screens where I all users to select from a list of options.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new UITableViewController subclass, <code>SimpleTableViewController</code>.</li>
<li>Create a UITableViewController in your storyboard (embedded in a navigation controller) and set its custom class to SimpleTableViewController.</li>
<li>Give the navigation controller for SimpleTableViewController a Storyboard ID of ""SimpleTableVC"". </li>
<li>In SimpleTableViewController.h, create an NSArray property that will represent the data in the table.</li>
<li>Also in SimpleTableViewController.h, create a protocol <code>SimpleTableViewControllerDelegate</code> with a required method <code>itemSelectedatRow:</code>, and a weak property called delegate of type <code>id&lt;SimpleTableViewControllerDelegate&gt;</code>. This is how we will pass the selection back to the parent controller.</li>
<li>In SimpleTableViewController.m, implement the tableview data source and delegate methods, calling <code>itemSelectedatRow:</code> in <code>tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath:</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>This approach has the added benefit of being fairly reusable. To use, import the SimpleTableViewController class in your ViewController.h, conform to the SimpleTableViewDelegate, and implement the <code>itemSelectedAtRow:</code> method. Then, to open the modal just instantiate a new SimpleTableViewController, set the table data and delegate, and present it.</p>

<pre><code>UINavigationController *navigationController = (UINavigationController *)[self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@""SimpleTableVC""];
SimpleTableViewController *tableViewController = (SimpleTableViewController *)[[navigationController viewControllers] objectAtIndex:0];
tableViewController.tableData = self.statesArray;
tableViewController.navigationItem.title = @""States"";
tableViewController.delegate = self;
[self presentViewController:navigationController animated:YES completion:nil];

<p>After a lot of searching I've eventually found a solution at <a href=""http://www.gamedev.net/topic/537664-handedness/#entry4480987"" rel=""noreferrer"">gamedev</a>:  </p>

<p>If your matrix looks like this:  </p>

<pre><code>{ rx, ry, rz, 0 }  
{ ux, uy, uz, 0 }  
{ lx, ly, lz, 0 }  
{ px, py, pz, 1 }
</code></pre>

<p>To change it from left to right or right to left, flip it like this:  </p>

<pre><code>{ rx, rz, ry, 0 }  
{ lx, lz, ly, 0 }  
{ ux, uz, uy, 0 }  
{ px, pz, py, 1 }
</code></pre>

"1263973","<p>I am able to draw a sprite on the screen of an iPhone, but when I try to rotate it I am getting some weird results. It seems to be stretching the sprite in the y direction more the closer the sprite gets to pointing down the y-axis (90 and 270 degrees). It displays correctly when pointing down the x and -x axes (0 and 180 degrees). It is basically like it is shearing instead of rotating. Here are the essentials of the code (projection matrix is ortho):</p>

<pre><code>glPushMatrix();
    glLoadIdentity();
    glTranslatef( position.x, position.y, -1.0f );      
    glRotatef( rotation, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f );
    glScalef( halfSize.x, halfSize.y, 1.0f );

    vertices[0] = 1.0f;
    vertices[1] = 1.0f;
    vertices[2] = 0.0f;
    vertices[3] = 1.0f;
    vertices[4] = -1.0f;
    vertices[5] = 0.0f;
    vertices[6] = -1.0f;
    vertices[7] = 1.0f;
    vertices[8] = 0.0f;
    vertices[9] = -1.0f;
    vertices[10] = -1.0f;   
    vertices[11] = 0.0f;

    glVertexPointer( 3, GL_FLOAT, 0, vertices );
    glDrawArrays( GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP, 0, 4 );
glPopMatrix();
</code></pre>

<p>Can anybody explain to me how to fix this please?</p>

<p>halfsize is just half the x and y extent of the sprite; removing the glScalef call does not make any difference. </p>

<p>Here is my matrix setup:</p>

<pre><code>glMatrixMode(GL_PROJECTION); 
glLoadIdentity();
glOrthof(0, 320, 480, 0, 0.01, 5);
glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
glLoadIdentity();

"1266709","<p>I have written an implementation of the A* search algorithm. The problem is that the heuristic I'm currently using only works accurately on square grids. As my map is isometric, the heuristic doesn't take into account <em>actual</em> the layout of the map and thus, the distance between cells.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> After extensive logging and analysis (read as <em>spending lots of time trying to figure out a banality</em>), I have come to the conclusion that my current heuristic works quite well, with one little exception: the end result is reversed for <em>real</em> straight and diagonal movement.</p>
<pre><code>inline int Pathfinder::calculateDistanceEstimate(const CellCoord&amp; coord) const
{
    int diagonal = std::min(abs(coord.x-goal-&gt;position.x), abs(coord.y-goal-&gt;position.y));
    int straight = (abs(coord.x-goal-&gt;position.x) + abs(coord.y-goal-&gt;position.y));
    return 14 * diagonal + 10 * (straight - 2 * diagonal);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This means that a straight move, which really costs <code>sqrt(2)</code> times more than a diagonal move on an <em>isometric</em> map, is calculated to be the that of a diagonal one. The question is: how can I modify my current heuristic so it will produce correct results for an isometric layout? Simply replacing <code>diagonal</code> with <code>straight</code> and vice versa will <em>not</em> work.</p>

","Accurate A* search heuristic for isometric maps?","<algorithm><search><heuristics><a-star><isometric>","2009-08-12 14:53:22","2911","1266822","2","<p>One thing to try would be converting from isometric coordinates to a square grid coordinate set for all calculations. </p>

<p>Say that 0,0 stays the root of the map. 0,1 stays the same, 1,2 becomes 0,2; 1,3 becomes 0,3; 2,3 becomes 1,4; 3,3 becomes 2,5; 0,2 becomes -1,1; etc. This puts you back into a square grid such that the coordinates and heuristics should work again.</p>

<p>Y coordinate becomes Y+sourceX offset (3,3 is at x=2; so becomes 2,5); finding sourceX mathmatically is proving itself more difficult.</p>

<p>[Stream of consciousness; ignore] Isometric coordinates at Y=0 are accurate for source X. So, to calculate source X you need to 'move left/up Y times' which should net a change of Y/2; rounded down, in the X coordinate.... roughly suggesting that the square coordinates would be:</p>

<pre><code>sourceX = X - Y/2
sourceY = Y + sourceX
</code></pre>

<p>Where sourceX and sourceY are the coordinates in a normal square grid; and Y/2 is integer arithmetic/rounded down.</p>

<p>So, in theory, this becomes:</p>

<pre><code>double DistanceToEnd(Point at, Point end)
{
    Point squareStart = squarify(at);
    Point squareEnd = squarify(end);
    int dx=squareStart.X-squareEnd.X;
    int dy=squareStart.Y-squareEnd.Y;
    return Math.Sqrt(dx*dx+dy*dy);
}
Point squarify(Point p1)
{
     return new Point(p1.X-p1.Y/2, p1.Y+(p1.X-p1.Y/2));
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong> based on new bits of question:</p>

<p>Assuming that you are trying to get distance(3,2; 3,3) &lt; (distance(2,3; 3,3) = distance(3,1; 3,3)); the following should work: (translated from C#; typos not guaranteed to be non present)</p>

<pre><code>inline int Pathfinder::calculateDistanceEstimate(const CellCoord&amp; coord) const
{
    int cx=coord.x - coord.y/2;
    int cy=coord.y + cx;
    int gx=goal-&gt;position.x - goal-&gt;position.y/2;
    int gy=goal-&gt;position.y + gx;
    int diagonal = std::min(abs(cx-gx), abs(cy-gy));
    int straight = (abs(cx-gx) + abs(cy-gy));

"1270078","<p>I am attempting to write a simple WPF learning project which creates a set of buttons inside a resizeable main window.  There is to be one <code>Button</code> per entry in a collection, and the contents of that collection may vary during run-time.  I want the buttons to fill the entire window (e.g. 1 button @ 100% width, 2 buttons @ 50% width, 3 buttons @ 33% width, etc. all at 100% height).  A simplified version of what I've written so far is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ItemsControl x:Name=""itemscontrolButtons"" ItemsSource=""{Binding}""&gt;
  &lt;ItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
    &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
      &lt;Button Tag=""{Binding}""&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding}"" /&gt;
      &lt;/Button&gt;
    &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
  &lt;/ItemsControl.ItemTemplate&gt;
  &lt;ItemsControl.ItemsPanel&gt;
    &lt;ItemsPanelTemplate&gt;
      &lt;StackPanel Orientation=""Horizontal"" /&gt;
    &lt;/ItemsPanelTemplate&gt;
  &lt;/ItemsControl.ItemsPanel&gt;
&lt;/ItemsControl&gt;
...    
List&lt;string&gt; listButtonTexts = new List&lt;string&gt;() { ""Button1"", ""Button2"" };
...
itemscontrolButtons.DataContext = listButtonTexts;
</code></pre>

<p>This results in this:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/SrnjF.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I have been unable to make the buttons stretch to fit the width and my attempts to use a <code>Grid</code> instead of <code>StackPanel</code> were fruitless.</p>

<p>Then, as an optional improvement, I would appreciate suggestions on how to adjust it such that if there are so many buttons that they cannot fit properly on a line or are narrower than a threshold, it will wrap onto a new line (thereby halving the button heights if going from 1 to 2 rows).</p>

<p>I'd like to emphasize that I'd like to know how to do this the <em>WPF way</em>.  I realize I can consume window resize messages and resize the controls explicitly, and that's how I'd have done it with MFC or WinForms, but from what I've read that is not how such things should be done with WPF.</p>

  <p>the handle goes exactly its width beyond the gutter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>More like exactly <em>half</em> its width, so it's not really moving past the end of the slider. When aligning your screenshots correctly, then you'll see the center of the handle is at the end of the slider, just like I expect it to be for a very precise setting. When the left is 0%, and the right is 100%, then the handle has to move past the end a bit to allow for choosing that 100%.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/FCiQv.png"" alt=""jQuery sliders with a line to indicate the end of the slider""></p>

<p>This is the same when enlarging the handle. When in your case the handle moves <em>more</em> than half its width over the right edge, then I assume it extends <em>less</em> than half on the left? When <a href=""http://jsbin.com/agoxe/36/edit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">playing with the CSS a bit</a> I get the same effect with huge handles, like:</p>

<pre>.ui-slider-horizontal .ui-state-default {
  /** Defaults: 
      margin-left: -0.6em;
      top: -0.3em;
  */
  width: 69px;
  height: 140px;
  margin-left: -39px;
  top: -68px;
}</pre>

<p>Even better <a href=""http://jsbin.com/umusa/17/edit"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">shown</a> using an arrow, a bit of a hack:</p>

<pre>.ui-slider-horizontal .ui-state-default {

  background-color: white;

"1278128","<p>Usually players in a soccer manager game have market values. The managers sell their players in accordance with these market values. They think: ""Oh, the player is worth 3,000,00 so I'll try to sell him for 3,500,000"".</p>

<p>All players have three basic qualities:</p>

<ul>
<li>strength value (1-99)</li>
<li>maximal strength they can ever attain (1-99)</li>
<li>motivation (1-5)</li>
<li>current age (16-40)</li>

<p>Based on these values, I calculate the market values at the moment. But I would like to calculate the market values dynamically according to the player transfers in the last period of time. How could I do this?</p>

<p>I have the above named qualities and the player transfers of the last period of time available for calculation.</p>

<p>How could I calculate it? Do I have to group the last transferred players by the qualities and simply take the average transfer price?</p>

","Manager game: How to calculate market values?","<statistics>","2009-08-14 14:20:30","1330","1278759","3","<p>My suggestion: define a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_space"" rel=""noreferrer"">distance function</a> that takes two players stats and return a distance value. Now that you have a distance between the two (that corresponds to the similarity between them) you can use the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering"" rel=""noreferrer"">K-means</a> algorithm to find clusters of similar players. </p>

<p>For each cluster you can take a number of values that can help you calculate the so called 'market price' (like the average or median value).</p>

<p>Here's a very simple example of how you could compute the distance function between two players:</p>

<pre><code>float distance(Player player1, Player player2){
    float distance = 0.0;

    distance += abs(player1.strength - player2.strength) / strengthRange;
    distance += abs(player1.maxStrength - player2.maxStrength) / maxStrength;
    distance += abs(player1.motivation - player2.motivation) / motivationRange;
    distance += abs(player1.age - player2.age) / ageRange;

    return distance;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now that you have the distance function you can apply the k-means algorithm:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Assign each player randomly to a cluster.</p></li>
<li><p>Now compute the centroid of each cluster. In your case the centroid coordinates will be (strength, maxStrength, motivation, age). To compute the centroid strength coordinate, for example, just average the strengths for the all players in the cluster.</p></li>
<li><p>Now assign each player to the nearest centroid. Note that in this step some players may have its cluster changed.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you have convergence or, in other words, until no player have its cluster changed in step 3.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Now that you have the clusters, you can calculate the average price fore similar players.</p>

"1286751","<p>I've just now started reading an Algorithms book that defined Graphs as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Graphs – which represent relationships
  between arbitrary pairs of objects.
  Figure 1.8(b) models a network of
  roads as a graph, where the vertices
  are cities and the edges are roads
  connecting pairs of cities. Graphs are
  likely the object in question whenever
  you seek a “network,” “circuit,”
  “web,” or “relationship.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Figure 1.8(b) is this:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/nRPYe.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>What confuses me here is the following line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... where the vertices are cities and the
  edges are roads connecting pairs of
  cities ...</p>
</blockquote>
","Difference between vertices and edges [Graphs, Algorithm and DS]","<algorithm><data-structures><graph-theory>","2009-08-17 08:21:40","15298","1286782","3","<p>Vertices are the dots, edges are the lines. Hence cities and roads.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what confuses you, but in general graphs are indeed used to model connections between objects. </p>

<p>If you have a bunch of objects (vertices) that may be ""connected"" to one another, a Graph would be the high level data structure to maintain it. I'm saying ""high level"" because in practice you will probably need supporting data structures to maintain a graph in memory/database/file: matrices, lists of links, many-to-many tables etc.</p>

<p>If the ""direction"" is not important, like in the case of the plot above (i.e. all roads are bidirectional), you have an ""undirected graph"". If the connection direction does have an importance (for example if there are unidirectional roads between cities), you'll have a ""directed graph"", where every edge is actually an ""arrow"", pointing at a certain direction.</p>

<p>If you're very new to this, I recommend reading the relevant <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia entry</a>.

"1291061","<p>I'd like to draw antialiased text on a transparent bitmap and have the antialiasing drawn as alpha blended pixels. This way, I can draw the bitmap onto any color surface (or an image, for that matter) and the antialiasing still looks fine.</p>

<p>Here is a simplified sample showing the problem:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e)
{
    base.OnPaint(e);
    Bitmap bitmap = new Bitmap(this.Width, this.Height);
    Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap);

<p>The ultimate goal of this is to use UpdateLayeredWindow to draw my transparent alpha blended window. I am creating a Conky-like application, and I'd like to be able to use ClearType rendering for text (this is easy without antialiasing, of course). </p>

<p>Currently, I grab the screen behind the form, draw that, and then draw my text. It looks good, but has to be updated and is slow to draw. Any other ideas to accomplish drawing text on the desktop would also be welcome.</p>

ClearType, by definintion, cannot play nice with alpha channel, since it blends colors, and thus isn't background-agnostic. So it ignores the alpha channel, and blends to black (which is your transparent color otherwise is). You need to enable plain grayscale anti-aliasing for the desired effect:</p>

"1297107","<p>I'm using the current jQuery to hide fade out a notification div, and then remove it, however when it completes there's an odd gap around the height of a <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> - meaning that subsequent forms and page elements don't display where they were before the notice appeared.</p>

<p>To recap: the fade out and remove is working perfectly but I'd like the gap left over to vanish as well. It's a minor thing, but it's bothering me. </p>

<p>The jquery:</p>

<pre><code>// Fade out any success divs.
$("".success"").fadeOut(6000, function(){
    $("".success"").remove();
});
</code></pre>

<p>The notification div is being written by PHP on postback, and has the following CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.success {
    background-color: #b3ffb2;
    border: 1px solid green;
}

.box {
    margin: 5px;
    padding: 5px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The div is very simple:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""success box""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Success!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: The surrounding markup of the page looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""wrapper""&gt;

    &lt;div id=""navigation""&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt; ... &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id=""container""&gt;
        &lt;div class=""success box""&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sucess!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
            Done&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        // more content
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: Using Firebug in FF 3.5.2, I can't see anything being left behind using the inspector. There's just an odd gap. I've also created a screenshot of this phenomena:</p>

<p>Also note that the physical text is going to look smaller than the text height you set because you need to factor in descenders--the parts of letters that go below the text line, like lowercase g's, p's, y's, etc., which is why you'll need to play with the exact pixel amounts if you change text size. Things may also vary between fonts--you'll want one that's well supported cross-platform to get good results on all platforms.)</p>

"1303893","<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This is super in-depth. I understand if you don't even want to read this, this is mostly for me to sort out my thought process.</p>

<p>Okay, so here's what I'm trying to do. I've got these objects:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/uwBko.png""/></p>

<p>When you click on one (or select several) it should display their properties on the right (as shown). When you edit said properties it should update the internal variables immediately.</p>

<p>I'm trying to decide on the best way to do this. I figure the selected objects should be stored as a list of pointers. It's either that, or have an isSelected bool on each object, and then iterate over all of them, ignoring the non-selected ones, which is just inefficient. So we click on one, or select several, and then the selectedObjects list is populated. We then need to display the properties. To keep things simple for the time being, we'll assume that all objects are of the same type (share the same set of properties). Since there aren't any instance-specific properties, I figure we should probably store these properties as static variables inside the Object class. Properties basically just have a name (like ""Allow Sleep""). There is one PropertyManager for each type of property (int,bool,double). PropertyManagers store <em>all</em> the values for properties of their respective type (this is all from the Qt API). Unfortunately, because PropertyManagers are required to create Properties I can't really decouple the two. I suppose this means that I have to place the PropertyManagers with the Properties (as static variables). This means we have one set of properties, and one set of property managers to manage <em>all</em> the variables in <em>all</em> the objects. Each property manager can only have one callback. That means this callback has to update <em>all</em> the properties of its respective type, for <em>all</em> objects (a nested loop). This yields something like this (in pseudo-code):</p>

<pre><code>function valueChanged(property, value) {
    if(property == xPosProp) {
        foreach(selectedObj as obj) {
            obj-&gt;setXPos(value);
        }
    } else if(property == ...
</code></pre>

<p>Which already bothers me a little bit, because we're using if statements where we shouldn't need them. The way around this would be to create a different property manager for every single property, so that we can have unique callbacks. This also means we need two objects for each property, but it might be a price worth paying for cleaner code (I really don't know what the performance costs are right now, but as I know you'll also say -- optimize when it becomes a problem). So then we end up with a ton of callbacks:</p>

<pre><code>function xPosChanged(property, value) {
    foreach(selectedObj as obj) {
        obj-&gt;setXPos(value);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which eliminates the entire if/else garbage but adds a dozen more event-listeners. Let's assume I go with this method. So now we had a wad of static Properties, along with their corresponding static PropertyManagers. Presumably I'd store the list of selected objects as Object::selectedObjects too since they're used in all the event callbacks, which logically belong in the object class. So then we have a wad of static event callbacks too. That's all fine and dandy.</p>

<p>So now when you edit a property, we can update the interal variables for all the selected objects via the event callback. But what happens when the internal variable is updated via some other means, how do we update the property? This happens to be a physics simulator, so all the objects will have many of their variables continuously updated. I can't add callbacks for these because the physics is handled by another 3rd party library. I guess this means I just have to assume all the variables <em>have</em> been changed after each time step. So after each time step, I have to update all the properties for all the selected objects. Fine, I can do that.</p>

<p>Last issue (I hope), is what values should we display when multiple objects are selected an there is an inconsistency? I guess my options are to leave it blank/0 or display a random object's properties. I don't think one option is much better than the other, but hopefully Qt provides a method to highlight such properties so that I can at least notify the user. So how do I figure out which properties to ""highlight""? I guess I iterate over all the selected objects, and all their properties, compare them, and as soon as there is a mismatch I can highlight it. So to clarify, upon selected some objects:</p>

<ol>
<li>add all objects to a selectedObjects list</li>
<li>populate the properties editor</li>
<li>find which properties have identical values and update the editor appropriately</li>
</ol>

<p>I think I should store the properties in a list too so that I can just push the whole list onto the properties editor rather than adding each property individually. Should allow for more flexibility down the road I think.</p>

<p>I think that about covers it... I'm still not certain how I feel about having so many static variables, and a semi-singleton class (the static variables would be initialized once when the first object is created I guess). But I don't see a better solution.</p>

<p>Please post your thoughts if you actually read this. I guess that's not really a question, so let me rephrase for the haters, <strong>What adjustments can I make to my suggested design-pattern to yield cleaner, more understandable, or more efficient code?</strong> (or something along those lines).</p>

<hr>

<p>Looks like I need to clarify. By ""property"" I mean like ""Allow Sleeping"", or ""Velocity"" -- all objects have these properties -- their VALUES however, are unique to each instance. <strong>Properties</strong> hold the string that needs to be displayed, the valid range for the values, and all the widget info. <strong>PropertyManagers</strong> are the objects that actually hold the value. They control the callbacks, and the value that's displayed. There is also another copy of the value, that's actually used ""internally"" by the other 3rd party physics library. </p>

<hr>

<p>Trying to actually implement this madness now. I have an EditorView (the black area drawing area in the image) which catches the mouseClick event. The mouseClick events then tells the physics simulator to query all the bodies at the cursor. Each physics body stores a reference (a void pointer!) back to my object class. The pointers get casted back to objects get pushed onto a list of selected objects. The EditorView then sends out a signal. The EditorWindow then catches this signal and passes it over to the PropertiesWindow along with the selected objects. Now the PropertiesWindow needs to query the objects for a list of properties to display... and that's as far as I've gotten so far. Mind boggling!</p>

<li>Retain all your views where you create them and hold on to pointers to those views, so you can send them <code>removeFromSuperview</code> individually as necessary</li>

    ON (child.lft BETWEEN parent.lft AND parent.rgt)
  LEFT JOIN Category intermediate

WHERE intermediate.CategoryId IS NULL
  AND parent.CategoryId = ?;
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>edit:</strong>  Okay, I understand now that the solution above is only a part of what you want.  You want:</p>

<ul>
<li>Direct ancestors of CD players</li>
<li>""Uncles"" of CD players (siblings of ancestors)</li>
<li>Siblings of CD players</li>
<li>Children of CD players</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me work on that for a few minutes.</p>

<hr>

<p>Here's what I've come up with:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT descendant.*,
  (current.lft BETWEEN descendant.lft AND descendant.rgt) AS is_selected,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.CategoryId) AS depth
FROM Category current
JOIN Category selected 
  ON (current.lft BETWEEN selected.lft AND selected.rgt)
JOIN Category descendant 
  ON (descendant.lft BETWEEN selected.lft AND selected.rgt)
LEFT JOIN Category intermediate 
  ON (intermediate.lft &gt; selected.lft AND intermediate.rgt &lt; selected.rgt
    AND descendant.lft &gt; intermediate.lft AND descendant.lft &lt; intermediate.rgt)
JOIN Category c
  ON (descendant.lft BETWEEN c.lft AND c.rgt)
WHERE intermediate.CategoryId IS NULL
  AND current.CategoryId = ?
GROUP BY descendant.CategoryId
ORDER BY depth, descendant.name;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li><code>current</code> is CD players</li>
<li><code>selected</code> is ancestors of CD players (electronics, portable electronics, CD players)</li>
<li><code>descendant</code> is any child or grandchild etc. of each <code>selected</code> ancestor</li>
<li><code>intermediate</code> is a descendant of each <code>selected</code> ancestor that is also a parent of <code>descendant</code> -- there must be none of these, hence the <code>IS NULL</code> restriction.</li>
<li><code>c</code> is the chain of ancestors from <code>descendant</code> back up to the top, for purposes of determining the depth.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I just realized that my solution would also return all descendants of the <code>current</code> node.  So if you were currently viewing ""portable electronics,"" the query would return its children, but it would also return the grandchild ""flash"" which may not be what you want.</p>

"1324544","<p>I plan on having to split up the Geometry object into a series of simpler shapes, and combine their centroids using this formula:<br>
<img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/e/9/7/e971da09a42ff4ebddec9f760fb504ab.png""/><br>
Mathematical details of this formula can be found in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centroid#Centroid_by_geometric_decomposition"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this Wikipedia article</a>.  </p>

<p><b>NOTICE:</b> Don't be suprised if my view of the mathematics is incorrect. I haven't done any complex math past trigonometry, and I've never had to deal with Greek letters. I think I understand this one pretty well, but please just let me know if I've got it wrong.  </p>

<p><i>An informational note</i>: the centroid of a gometric shape or prism is not just the middle of the shape. It is the center of gravity, or center of mass. I assume that Geometry objects can encapsulate 3D prisms as well, so I may have to take this into account in the future, but for now I'm focusing on 2D Geometries only. For a 2D shape you have to imagine it being a stiff piece of paper with a given shape, and the centroid would be the point at which this piece of paper would balance on a needle.  </p>

<p>The first problem I'm faced with is that I need to find a way to accurately split any given Geometry object into simple-enough shapes, so this formula can work correctly. Does anyone have any ideas how this might be accomplished? Or is there a better procedure that will still work universally?  </p>

<p>The second problem I'm faced with is that after the geometry is split up, how do I go about finding the centroid of each piece? Each type of simple shape (triangle, quadrilateral, semicircle, etc) has its own centroid formula. Is there a way for me to figure which type of shape each piece is?</p>

It's commonly done with planar triangles or quadrilaterals.

You'd have to supply the raw geometry for the body in question, of course.</p>

<p>You've a long row to hoe yet.  You'll have to do all of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find an auto meshing program and learn how to input the geometry for your 2D shape.</li>
<li>Run the auto mesher and get a mesh output which will consist of all the 2D points in space and the connectivities of all the triangular and quadrilateral elements.</li>
<li>Write a program to read in the mesh and calculate the area and centroid of each element.</li>
<li>Plug those values into the formula you cited to calculate the centroid of your original 2D shape.  This means looping over all the elements and accumulating the areas an the products of the (x,y) coordinates of each element centroid and its area.</li>
<li>Once you have an answer, you need to check convergence.  You do this by refining your mesh by making the elements smaller and recalculating.  You know you've converged when you refine the mesh and the answers change by less than a small tolerance (5% or whatever you're willing to tolerate).</li>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/uwBko.png""/></p>

<p>So what's happening is when you click an object, change a property, deselect it and then reselect it, the property editor will be reset to all 0s, even though those aren't the actual values. When you actually click in the text boxes in the editor, the correct value appears. Does that mean it's just a display issue or what? How come the editor has two different values? <em>This only happens when the highlighted lines (with arrows) are left intact -- if they are commented out, this won't occur.</em> The code:</p>

<pre><code>void PropertyBrowser::objectUpdated() {
    if(m_selectedObjects.isEmpty()) {
        return;
    }
    m_variantManager-&gt;disconnect(this); // &lt;--- THIS LINE
    QMapIterator&lt;QtProperty*, QByteArray&gt; i(m_propertyMap);
    bool diff;
    while(i.hasNext()) {
        i.next();
        diff = false;
        for(int j = 1; j &lt; m_selectedObjects.size(); ++j) {
            if(m_selectedObjects.at(j)-&gt;property(i.value()) != m_selectedObjects.at(j - 1)-&gt;property(i.value())) {
                diff = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if(diff) setBackgroundColor(topLevelItem(i.key()), QColor(232,232,232));
        else setBackgroundColor(topLevelItem(i.key()), Qt::white);
        m_variantManager-&gt;setValue(i.key(), m_selectedObjects.first()-&gt;property(i.value()));
    }

    connect(m_variantManager, SIGNAL(valueChanged(QtProperty*, QVariant)), 
            this, SLOT(valueChanged(QtProperty*, QVariant)));  // &lt;--- AND THIS LINE
}
</code></pre>

<p>However, I need those lines because they prevent <code>setValue</code> from triggering a <code>valueChanged</code> signal which causes other issues. This seems to indicate that calls this function fixes the issue:</p>

<pre><code>void PropertyBrowser::valueChanged(QtProperty *property, const QVariant &amp;value) {
    if(m_propertyMap.find(property) != m_propertyMap.end()) { 
        foreach(QObject *obj, m_selectedObjects) {

        }
    }

<p>Not sure if this will fix something, but you can stop signals on one object using object->blockSignals(true). This will shut the object up untill you call the function with false.</p>

<p>Try disconnecting only signal you connect, shutting m_variantManager instead of disconnecting, and adding qDebug() in relevant slots -- there is some rogue signal emitted when you disconnected it seems.</p>

<p>EDIT:
Since you implement the slot yourself, you can always have a flag and check it in PropertyBrowser::valueChanged then just ignore the signal.</p>

<p>I wonder if m_variantManager->addProperty() (called from setSelected() doesn't immidiately set the values, or sets them but queues updates. Then your disconnecting in objectUpdated() causes those events to be discarded.</p>

"1327126","<p>In the UK throughout the 80's and 90's (70's too I believe!) there was a classic TV program called ""Blockbuster"", which had a display of hexagons in a honeycomb grid, like this (sorry for blurry pic!):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/URM5X.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/URM5X.jpg"" alt=""picture from old Blockbuster TV game""></a><br>

<p>As you can see, there are 5 columns of letters and four rows. 1 person or team is trying to travel horizontally, one is trying to travel vertically.  You win a hexagon by answering a question, and the answer will begin with the letter displayed in that hexagon.</p>

<p>The winning person or team is the first to ""connect a line"" - note, that could be going back on itself (e.g. if it is blocked by the opposing team winning that hexagon) so there are many, many possible winning combinations.</p>

<p>Years ago, when I was just starting out coding, I wrote a conference game based on this puzzle (we made it alternating octagons and squares to avoid copyright infringement!) but the bit I always struggled with was the algorithm to check when a complete line was made.  The easy ones are fine, but ones going up, down, back and forth I got really stuck on!</p>

<p>I ended up basically coding a massive brute-force loop that still didn't catch every eventuality.  I therefore had to put a button on the conference organiser's screen to enable them to quickly declare a winner if the logic didn't detect it!  Talk about dirty hack...</p>

<p>Now I think back to this puzzle I had to solve, and I wonder if any of you out there would care to propose a more elegant solution?  Language agnostic of course (all including pseudocode happily accepted).</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> It's fine to store your data how you want. I stuck it in an array.</p>

"1327442","<p>I am working on an ASP.NET 2.0 web solution which currently runs en-GB and zh-HK languages as the 2 current languages for the site. Others will be added at a later date.</p>

<p>One of the requirements is that the user can choose to override the language displayed to another language. Therefore users in Hong Kong can view the site in English and vice versa. </p>

<p>My 2 resource files are</p>

<ul>
<li>Resources.resx (for English - default translations)</li>
<li>Resources.zh-HK.resx (for Chinese)</li>
</ul>

<p>The site performs this logic</p>

<ol>
<li>Load user details</li>
<li>Check if user has overridden the preferred language</li>
<li>If they have, set the Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture to this language.</li>
<li>If they haven't, use the browsers default.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is implemented in the following code:</p>

<pre><code>//This method is written in a base page, which all pages in the site derive from
protected override void InitializeCulture()
{ 
    User user = /*Load custom user object...*/;
    string threadLanguage = Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture.IetfLanguageTag;

    //If the browser is using a different language, 
    //but the has chosen a preferred language, 
    //change the CurrentUICulture over.
    if (!threadLanguage.Equals(user.Language, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    {
        CultureInfo userLanguageCulture = CultureInfo.CreateSpecificCulture(user.Language);
        Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = userLanguageCulture;
    }

    base.InitializeCulture();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have also configured the web.config to pick up the uiCulture automatically with</p>

<pre><code>&lt;globalization uiCulture=""auto""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>For some very very odd reason, some users (even en-GB users) are finding the language is switching over the zh-HK for no reason whatsoever - sometimes between pages! I have added some debugging code to these pages which should reveal more information in the coming days. All it has revealed so far is that users are not necessarily from zh-HK, some are from zh-CN or zh-TW. Although this might help, because en-GB users are seeing zh-HK I think it is just a red herring.</p>

<p>What I have noticed is that the switch over occurs on page content (those inheriting from the base page, which the IntializeCulture() method exists). The custom user controls I have written do not experience this problem and appear in the correct language configured by the user. Therefore a page would have combinations of both English and Chinese content - eek!</p>

<p>Can anyone give guidance as to if I am coding this correctly, or an alternative way of approaching the requirements.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

<p>Dominic</p>

<p>P.S. This is an intermittent problem and not a permanent. There seems to be no common action that replicates this issue. It just - happens.</p>

<p>P.P.S Here is an image of the problem in action:</p>

<p><img src=""https://lh6.ggpht.com/_I13gV_vlrcc/SpPBoawBi9I/AAAAAAAAE6g/s7fMWAiqhhs/s800/sample.png"" alt=""Web page showing Chinese/English problem""></p>

<hr>

<p>Update 23 Sep 09:</p>

<p>After trying to change it to Page.Culture, I am still having more intermittent problems.</p>

<p>I have a couple of ideas at why this could possibly be occurring, but am unable to justify my 'hypothesis':</p>

<ul>
<li>We are using IIS 5.0 Isolation Mode, meaning only aspnet_wp.exe is running and not w3wp.exe for each IIS instance.</li>
<li>Reporting Services is also running on the server, generating reports for Hong Kong.</li>
<li>The fault occurs more frequently when the site was under heavy load - I assume due to large reports being generated.</li>
</ul>

<p>Apart from that, I do not know what else could cause the problem. I would show another screenshot, but the problem is identical and did appear in the same place as the previous screenshot showed.</p>

<p>Update 25 Sep 09:</p>

<p>I think we I might have solved it. In our Web.config, there is a  tag that was configured as follows:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;globalization uiCulture=""auto"" culture=""auto""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>After removing that, after initial testing, it has yet to turn up!</p>

<p>Update 13 Oct 09:</p>

<p>The problem has turned up again :-(</p>

<p>Update 26 Oct 09:</p>

<p>It seems that if another user of the site changes their preferred language, it affects all other users on the site! Although their preferred language is set, somehow someone else's language switch affects the other users of the site!</p>

<p>In summary, the frameset.asp, was replated with a frameset.aspx, which generates a single cookie / Session ID for all frames.</p>

<p>Above given images is of my application leaks.</p>

<p>Here I want to understand that, in Extended Detail - you can see different colors like light green, light pink, light brown, light purple.</p>

<p>What does each color indicates?</p>

<p>Now the other confusion is ""How to locate the code which is creating a memory leak?""</p>

<p>Upto what limit of memory leak - the actual iPhone can go on with.
(suppose 10 bytes no problem, 20 bytes no problem &amp; 200 bytes a problem)</p>

<ul>
<li>What does each color indicates?</li>
<li>Which color indicates our code / From which detail we can get to the code where we have allocated the object &amp; forgot to dealloc it?</li>
</ul>

<p>(For example - On clicking of UIKit second cell in detail - we cant get to the code)</p>

<ul>
<li>Why we must resolve all the leaks? - even a single leak can chock up iPhone ?</li>
<li>Why iPhone allows leaks to be remain in memory? / why garbage collection isn't done automatically after termination of application?</li>
<li>If I try to dealloc objects which should be deallocated according to instruments, My application terminates abnormally. If I don't dealloc, My application runs perfectly, How?</li>
<li>Why it is suggested that you wait in a view up to 10 or more seconds, if there is a leak, leak will be detected by Instruments?</li>

<p>Now to answer the other questions you had:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why we must resolve all the leaks? -
even a single leak can chock up
iPhone ?</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes.  Part of the reason is not only that you will simply run out of memory, but since there is only so much memory to go around for the whole phone a watchdog application is constantly monitoring your app and will shut it down early if it sees memory use only ever growing...</p>

<ul>
<li>Why iPhone allows leaks to be remain
in memory? / why garbage collection
isn't done automatically after
termination of application?</li>
</ul>

<p>All your application memory is freed when the app quits.</p>

<ul>
<li>If I try to dealloc objects which
should be deallocated according to
instruments, My application
terminates abnormally. If I don't
dealloc, My application runs
perfectly, How?</li>
</ul>

<p>Here I can't help, you really need to read more on the retain/release memory cycle... if you release an object that has a retain count of 0, the app crashes because the object is gone.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why it is suggested that you wait in
a view up to 10 or more seconds, if
there is a leak, leak will be
detected by Instruments?</li>
</ul>

<p>Because instruments works by sampling memory every so often, so it might take a little bit for instruments to get around to reading the memory after an action.</p>

Adobe need to create a native function to return this to us.</p>

<p>But, for now...  try this:</p>

<p>You will need to cause a explicit coercion to get it!
Because when you make and explicit coercion you get an Error like this:</p>

<pre>
TypeError: Error #1034: 
Type Coercion failed: cannot convert Main@1c49d31 to flash.utils.ByteArray.

</pre>

<p>Note that in this error you get what you want...  the @1c49d31. This hash is like an ID in the memory allocation.</p>

<p>I did a lot of tests. This hash just change when you call a ""new"" (in C languages is equivalent to [[... alloc] init]) and for static functions and static properties, the allocation occurs a little different... anyway...</p>

<p>Backing to Flash, the problem is we don't have a direct way to get this hash without an Error.</p>

<p>But this is not a realy big problem. All that you need is to use some ""try"" and ""catch""
Like this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-as prettyprint-override""><code>try
{
    ByteArray(anyObjectToKnowItAllocationHash);
}
catch (e:Error)
{
    trace(e);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And voila!
You will get the hash without result in an Error!
After this I did a more refinated way... Try this:</p>

<pre class=""lang-as prettyprint-override""><code>var memoryHash:String;

try
{
    FakeClass(anyObjectToKnowItAllocationHash);
}
catch (e:Error)
{
    memoryHash = String(e).replace(/.*([@|\$].*?) to .*$/gi, '$1');
}

internal final class FakeClass { }
</code></pre>

<p>A little explain about this:
The fakeClass is to be sure about this will generate an Error.
The RegularExpression is to capture the last @...  that appear. Because Objects and Functions generate different messages on this Error. And the $ is to catch the Static Objects, Class and Functions, bacause they don't have an ""@"" in its memory hash and different zones in memory.</p>

<p>This little code works so fine to me! Now i can finish some great engines that i'm making that work with memory management, weak references and ID based on memory.</p>

"1345473","<p>I am using jQuery 1.3.2.</p>

<p>There is an input field in a form. 
Clicking on the input field opens a div as a dropdown. The div contains a list of items. As the list size is large there is a vertical scrollbar in the div.
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/EUZQs.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>To close the dropdown when clicked outside, there is a blur event on the input field.  </p>

<p>Now the problem is:  </p>

<p>In chrome(2.0.172) when we click on the scrollbar, the input field will loose focus.
And now if you click outside, then the dropdown won't close(as the input has already lost focus when you clicked on the srollbar)</p>

<p>In Firefox(3.5), IE(8), opera(9.64), safari() when we click on the scrollbar the input field will not loose focus. Hence when you click outside (after clicking on the srollbar) the dropdown will close. This is the expected behaviour.</p>

<p>So In chrome once the scrollbar is clicked, and then if I click outside the dropdown won't close.
How can i fix this issue with chrome.</p>

<p>You will find that the renderer only needs this extended stride for some formats, so perhaps your simplest approach is to force a different capture format. An alternative is to use the sample grabber filter instead of the VMR.</p>

<p>In your web.config, add a connection string entry:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;connectionStrings&gt;
  &lt;add 
    name=""MyConnectionString"" 
    connectionString=""Data Source=sergio-desktop\sqlexpress;Initial 
    Catalog=MyDatabase;User ID=userName;Password=password""
    providerName=""System.Data.SqlClient""
  /&gt;
&lt;/connectionStrings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Let's break down the component parts here:</p>

<p><strong>Data Source</strong> is your server. In your case, a named SQL instance on <code>sergio-desktop</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Initial Catalog</strong> is the default database queries should be executed against. For normal uses, this will be the database name.</p>

<p>For the authentication, we have a few options. </p>

<p><strong>User ID</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> means using SQL credentials, not Windows, but still very simple - just go into your Security section of your SQL Server and create a new Login. Give it a username and password, and give it rights to your database. All the basic dialogs are  very self-explanatory.</p>

<p>You can also use integrated security, which means your .NET application will try to connect to SQL using the credentials of the worker process. Check <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1349218/web-config-problem/1349256#1349256"">here for more info</a> on that.</p>

<p>Finally, in code, you can get to your connection string by using:</p>

<pre><code>ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings[""MyConnectionString""].ConnectionString

"1356160","<p>I have a Visual Studio setup project. 
Upon installation, it creates an uninstall batch file in the application folder.  IF the user wants to uninstall the product, he can go to ""Add/Remove Programs"", or he can just double-click the uninstall.cmd.  The contents are: </p>

<pre><code>%windir%\system32\msiexec /x {CC3EB7BF-DD82-48B9-8EC5-1B0B62B6D285}

<p>But, in order for upgrades to work properly, I have to increment the Version number, every time I produce a new MSI.  And, if I increment the Version number, then I also have to generate a new Guid for the ProductCode.  Which means the static uninstall.cmd file needs to change.  </p>

"1358896","<p>I've been stumbling over this for a while and was wondering if anyone has run into this problem before.</p>

<p>The application I'm working on is divided into multiple data plots and a single timeline at the bottom of the screen.  Each plot (which is actually multiple textures layered on top of each other) as well as the timeline is rendered to a separate texture.  The timeline texture is rendered first, followed by each of the plot textures from the top of the screen to the bottom.  I am using DXUT and DirectX9 (March 2009).</p>

<p>After adding time text to the timeline texture, I noticed that the text was repeated in the title bar of every data plot.  Here's a screencap of a portion of the display, it shows just a single plot, but the text repeats on every plot opened:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i777.photobucket.com/albums/yy53/bsruth/d3dxfont_repeat.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>It seems like it is tied directly to the DrawText being called in the timeline's render function.  I do use relative coordinates as the rect being passed to DrawText, but since I've already set the render target to the desired texture it should only affect the current texture.  Not every texture rendered afterward. </p>

<p>Has anyone ever run into any problems similar to this using D3DXFont?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: After some more experimentation, it looks like it has something to do with the Z buffer.  By adding D3DCLEAR_ZBUFFER to the clear on each texture surface, the duplicate text is gone.  While the problem seems bypassed for now, I'm still curious as to why the Z buffer for a completely separate texture was being written during my DrawText call.</p>

<p>Why is this? And why is it inconsistent between different block-level elements? I would expect that the table cell text be vertically aligned the same as the paragraph's.</p>

<p><strong>Follow up</strong>: The whole reason why I have <code>display:inline</code> is so that the border is only as wide as the text. If using <code>display:block</code> (the default for <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>) then the border is as wide as the parent element.</p>

<p>I mean, I have to replace the toolstripbutton with a common button, also have to add more code on designer class (base form) : </p>

<pre><code>grpCommonControls.Height = 20;
dtTScomponent = new ToolStripControlHost(grpCommonControls);
dtTScomponent.Alignment = ToolStripItemAlignment.Right;
toolStrip1.Items.Add(dtTScomponent);


tssbExporta.Alignment = ToolStripItemAlignment.Left;

<p>I was needed to add a simple toolstrip with some toolstrip controls on my base form, but the designer dont allow me to work correctly with those (I cannot route the events from toolstripbutton to my child forms as an example)</p>
","Benefits of using Inherit Forms Controls","<c#><winforms><design-patterns>","2009-09-03 18:46:25","379","1375265","2","<p>When you create a form that inherits another form that contains different controls, there are not event handlers automatically hooked up for you. Instead you need to do that as in your code sample. Another approach is to attach that event handler in your base form, and then have the base form expose events that you can listen to. Example:</p>

<p>In the base form:</p>

<pre><code>public event EventHandler ExecInvoked;
private void btnExec_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
     OnExecInvoked(e);
}

protected virtual void OnExecInvoked(EventArgs e)
{
    EventHandler evt = ExecInvoked;
    if (evt != null)
    {
        evt(this, e);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in your inherited form, you can either set up an event handler for the <code>ExecInvoked</code> event (you can probably do this using the events list in the property grid), or you can override the <code>OnExecInvoked</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>protected override void OnExecInvoked(EventArgs e)
{
    base.OnExecInvoked(e);

    // do what the form should do when Exec is invoked
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way you have encapsulated the internals of the base form, so that the child form does not know what kind of control that raises the event (it could even be several different controls leading to the same event being raised), but the base form still provides a clear point where the child form can react on it.</p>

<p>What you can do though is create a new undecorated window and set it's location accordingly and draw whatever you want inside it.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: When Java needs to paint outside it's window bounds (like the case of pop up messages or combo boxes drop downs) if the component falls inside the bounds it uses the swing light weight mechanism.

"1376504","<p>I have been working on designing a file server that could take the load off from the primary website, and serve images/files over the web to the client.</p>

<p>Primary goals of the file server:<br>
- Take off load from primary server hosting the site<br>
- Reuse the existing web server code base and avoid duplication of code/logic for better maintainability<br>
- Being scalable for increasing downloads<br>
- Hide real download url path from user  </p>

<p>By keeping above in mind, i could come up with two approaches. Sequence diagram representation of the two approaches for ease of understanding [apologies for the skewed use of sequence diagram]. Neither of the approaches would satisfy all my goals.   </p>

<p>Which of these approaches would you recommend considering my goals?<br>
Is there a better third approach?  </p>

<p>Some of the differences, i could think of:<br>
- Approach #1 would result in duplicating BL code causing maintainability issues<br>
- Approach #2 would reuse code and centralize BL reducing maintainability issues<br>
- Approach #1 would reduce network calls while #2 increases them</p>

<p>The concept of file servers, scalability of downloads, bandwidth distribution have all been there for a while now. Please share your thoughts!  </p>

<p>UPDATED:<br>
Approach #1 looks very attractive as it takes the load off the primary server completely. The only issue to address in #1 is the code duplication and maintainability issues. This could be overcome by having just one project for BL/DAC comprising the functionality required by both web service and file server. And, reference the assembly/library in both web service and file server projects. Now, there is only one BL/DAC code to maintain and also avoids the network calls in approach #2.  </p>

Your requirement sounds a bit abnormal and might indicate a mistake in db schema design. Why do you want to delete an Item when a related Folder is deleted? What if there is another Folder still related to that item, since it is a many-to-many relationship? In that case, deleting the Item will actually cause foreign key violation between Item and FolderItem. If the Items actually do belong under a specific Folder, aka one to many relationship, you will not need the FolderItem table at all.</p>

<p>I guess the mostly likely case is you want to delete the Item if there is no other FolderItem entries related to it. In that case, trigger is the appropriate solution, but you need to make sure you are checking for it in the trigger logic.</p>

"1379607","<p>On a Java portal you can have portlets that include data provided by other applications.

The two Sun specifications in question that we want to duplicate are JSR168 and JSR286.</p>

<p>I need a cPython solution. Not Jython or Java. Nothing against those tools, we just don't use them. For the record, the Jython based <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/portletpy/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Portletpy</a> does the opposite of what we are aiming to do.</p>

<p>Also, I suspect this question has been caused by a misunderstanding on our part of how the JSR168/JSR286 specification works. I <strong><em>think</em></strong> that JSR168/JSR286 is an arcane protocol for communicating some sort of content between separate applications, but in the Java world that tends to be done by other methods such as SOAP. Instead, the issue might be that these protocols are simply definitions of how to display content objects in views. If all we have to do is handle SOAP calls and display data, then this whole question is moot.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly, you want the Django application to take the place of the existing ""Java Portal/Portlet Container"" in the diagram. Unfortunately, the interface between the portlet container and the individual portlets is using in-memory API calls, not as a Web service. There's no easy URL-like interface where you can call into the Java piece to get a chunk of HTML which you then incorporate into a Django-served page.</p>

<p>JSR 286 is an update and while it refines the mechanisms for communicating between portlets, as well as serving resources from portlets, it doesn't really change the above model radically.</p>

<p>I'm not saying it couldn't be done - just that there's no easy, standard way to do it.</p>

","How to make gridview a child element of a treeview in wpf application","<wpf><datagrid><treeview>","2009-09-06 10:37:56","14048","1386903","2","<p>The good news is that you're doing a lot more work here than you need to, which is probably why you're having trouble.</p>

<p>The bad news is that you should really study a little more about WPF to properly grok this and come up with a good approach that's clean and concise.  I'll try and point you in the right direction.</p>

<p>Firstly, you should get your head around ItemsControl.  It's a really powerful class and is the base class of many of the everyday controls you would use in a WPF application.  You should understand how binding any collection (IEnumerable, IList, IBindingList etc) to the ItemsSource property of ItemsControl will cause child items to be created.</p>

<p>You should then understand (if you don't already) how data types are converted into UI elements via DataTemplates.  This is a simple but powerful concept.</p>

<p>Then you should experiment with a small extension to the above, namely HeaderedItemsControl and HierarchicalDataTemplate.  This will give you all the tools you need to use the TreeView in the way you want to.</p>

<p>At no point would you need to create any TreeViewItems in C# code.  If you can get the underlying data objects to reflect the hierarchy you want to display (irrespective of whether each node is a simple text label or a data grid) then you can create hierarchical data templates for all levels and have WPF take care of binding everything and creating the TreeViewItems for you.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>I have some questions for your edited question:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the difference between <code>Root</code> and <code>Nodes</code>?</li>
<li>Do you have a class hierarchy that models the relationship between nodes?  If so, just use that rather than copying the objects into instances of <code>Root</code> and <code>Nodes</code>.  I'll give you a made up example.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let's assume you have <code>Customer</code>s who place <code>Order</code>s, and each order has <code>Item</code>s.</p>

<pre><code>public class Customer
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable&lt;Order&gt; Orders { get; set; }
}

public class Order
{
    public DateTime PurchaseDate { get; set; }
    public IEnumerable&lt;OrderItem&gt; Items { get; set; }
}

public class OrderItem
{
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    public int Quantity { get; set; }
    public double UnitPrice { get; set; }
    public double TotalPrice { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above types represent a hierarchy.  If you have a structure like this, then you can bind it directly to the UI.  You don't need to create any <code>Root</code> or <code>Node</code> objects.  This is the WPF way :)</p>

<p>(Note that if you don't have the above class hierarchy, you might set about creating one specifically for use in the UI.  Read more about the MVVM pattern if you're interested.)</p>

<p>In your XAML you would define the TreeView as:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;TreeView x:Name=""_treeView"" ItemsSource=""{Binding}""&gt;
  &lt;TreeView.Resources&gt;
    &lt;HierarchicalDataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type data:Customer}""
                              ItemsSource=""{Binding Path=Orders}""&gt;
      &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding Name}""/&gt;
    &lt;/HierarchicalDataTemplate&gt;
    &lt;DataTemplate DataType=""{x:Type data:Order}""&gt;
      &lt;StackPanel&gt;
        &lt;TextBlock Text=""{Binding PurchaseDate}""/&gt;
        &lt;ListView ItemsSource=""{Binding Items}""&gt;
          &lt;ListView.View&gt;
            &lt;GridView&gt;
              &lt;GridViewColumn DisplayMemberBinding=""{Binding ProductName}"" /&gt;
              &lt;GridViewColumn DisplayMemberBinding=""{Binding Quantity}"" /&gt;
              &lt;GridViewColumn DisplayMemberBinding=""{Binding UnitPrice}"" /&gt;
              &lt;GridViewColumn DisplayMemberBinding=""{Binding TotalPrice}"" /&gt;
            &lt;/GridView&gt;
          &lt;/ListView.View&gt;
        &lt;/ListView&gt;
      &lt;/StackPanel&gt;
    &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
  &lt;/TreeView.Resources&gt;
&lt;/TreeView&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And in code-behind, you'd do something like this:</p>

<pre><code> _treeView.DataContext = customers; // eg. IEnumerable&lt;Customer&gt;

    -S specifies the server, which is (.\SQLExpress) in this example.
    -E specifies to use Windows authentication to connect to SQL Server.
    -A r specifies to add only the role provider feature.

<p>Add connection string for role provider:</p>

<p>Your code can then look like this:</p>

<pre><code>AVCFrame *frame = [AVCFrame frameWithCommandType:AVCCommandTypePlay
                                     subunitType:mySubunitType
                                       subunitID:mySubunitID];
// You likely won't actually be writing to the L2CAPChannel. See below.
[l2capChannel writeAsync:[frame mutableBytes] length:[frame length] refcon:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>That's not the best interface. You'll want to read through the <em>AV/C Digital Interface Command Set General Specification</em>.</p>

<p>As far as the byte packing goes (and it will have to happen eventually), you'll want to use something like:</p>

<pre><code>// Returns |subunitType| shifted and masked appropriately for bit_oring
// with subunit ID to create an address octet.
inline UInt8
AVRCAddressSubunitType(UInt8 subunitType) {
   const UInt8 kLeastThreeBytes = 0x07;
   UInt8 shiftedType = (subunitType &lt;&lt; 3) &amp; ~kLeastThreeBytes;
   return shiftedType;
}

// Returns |subunitID| masked appropriately for bit_oring with subunit type
// to create an address octet.
inline UInt8
AVRCAddressSubunitID(UInt8 subunitID) {
   const UInt8 kLeastThreeBytes = 0x07;
   UInt8 maskedID = subunitID &amp; kLeastThreeBytes;
   if (subunitID &amp; ~kLeastThreeBytes) {

   }
   return maskedID;
}

- (void)l2capChannelOpenComplete:(IOBluetoothL2CAPChannel *)l2capChannel

</code></pre>

<p>For more details on <code>IOWhatever</code>, look to the extensive IOKit documentation. At least in 10.5, the reference docs (as opposed to programming guides) in the docset were kind of screwy, so you'll do well to look at the headers themselves.</p>

<p>You'll need to consult more documentation than you've looked at so far. The AV/C command frame whose diagram you've included is actually the payload (borne in the Command/Response Message Information field) of an <strong>AVCTP frame</strong>, which is what you actually have to send over the L2CAP transport. The <a href=""http://www.bluetooth.com/NR/rdonlyres/3C6FF5FB-DE17-42B8-A673-0C9D43E87CD9/6541/AVCTP_SPEC_V13.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AVCTP spec</a> sketches a rudimentary API in ""Appendix A, AVCTP Upper Interface"".</p>

<p>You'll need to either locate or write yourself an AVCTP library in order to send the AV/C command frames. You'll want to have the AVCTP library wrap the L2CAP channel, so that you actually send your command frames via it and receive your command frames from it. Good luck! Interfacing with hardware can be a lot of fun, and you'll learn a lot.</p>

"1386826","<p>I have a UITableView where in some instances, certain sections have zero rows. My goal is that when this is true, I don't want any wasted space in the table view, it should look like there's no data.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is with the header and footer for the sections, which are showing even if there's no row and despite me overriding the delegate method to return 0.0f.</p>

<p>Here's what it looks like - you can see the ~20p of gray space at the top there, headers and footers of about 10p each for a section with 0 rows.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Ox7Z7.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Ox7Z7.png"" alt=""alt text""></a><br>

<p>Here's my pseudo code:</p>

<pre><code>- (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForHeaderInSection:(NSInteger)section {
     if ([section hasRow]) {
          return 10.0f;
     } else {
          return 0.0f;
     }
}



- (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForFooterInSection:(NSInteger)section {
     if ([section hasRow]) {
          return 10.0f;
     } else {
          return 0.0f;
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I have verified that these methods are being called and that the proper execution path is taking place.</p>

<p>One wrinkle - this view controller is using a XIB and that UITableView has the section header and footer values set at 10.0 (default), though I thought that was overriden by the delegate method, if implemented.</p>

<p>This is an app targeting 3.0.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
","UITableView Not Respecting heightForHeaderInSection/heightForFooterInSection?","<iphone><cocoa-touch>","2009-09-06 21:50:48","29567","1387025","8","<p>In a ""grouped"" UITableView on the iPhone it will still render a minimum height for header and footer, effectively ignoring your code to set it to zero.  It is not linked to the XIB default.</p>

<p>This is because a zero height section header or footer would look very odd.  Therefore Apple has decreed that a header height cannot be set to 0.  And therefore multiple ""empty"" sections will render oddly as per your screenshot.</p>

<p>I'm afraid it's all because you're going the wrong way about clearing the header size when there are no data rows; instead you should <em>not be calling any methods for empty sections</em>.  It is a bad technique because essentially the iPhone is having to call more methods than it ought to, and also you render more headers than you want to (usually - sometimes people want to leave the blank headers there, for example for drag and drop).</p>

<p>So, for example, let's imagine that you have a number of sections, but only some of them have more than one row in (perhaps based on user settings/filters).  </p>

<p>The <strong>wrong</strong> way of implementing it is:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSInteger)numberOfSectionsInTableView:(UITableView *)tableView {
  return totalNumberOfPossibleSections;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then for each section you have no result for:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {
  if (![section hasRow]) return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>- (CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForFooterInSection:(NSInteger)section {
  if (![section hasRow]) return 0.0f;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>correct</strong> way of implementing it is:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSInteger)numberOfSectionsInTableView:(UITableView *)tableView {
  return numberOfSectionsWhichHaveAtLeastOneRowInThem;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then each section will have at least one result.  That way, sections with no data aren't even rendered, methods aren't even called for them.  <em>Note: my two variable names are made up to convey what they'll contain!  They're not special Apple variables...</em></p>

<p>Now, pretty much everything about this control works as expected, except for that fact that it won't respond to <code>TabCtrl_SetItemSize</code>. Try as I may, the size I get for the tabs when I get to draw them (in the <code>DRAWITEMSTRUCT</code> passed to <code>WM_DRAWITEM</code>) is always the size that fits the longest caption in them and never the size I've set with <code>TabCtrl_SetItemSize</code>.</p>

<p>However, in the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760694(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>TabCtrl_SetItemSize</code> documentation</a>, it says that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[<code>TabCtrl_SetItemSize</code>] sets the width and height of tabs in a
  fixed-width or <strong>owner-drawn tab</strong>
  control. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only way I've managed to have a decent resizing is by setting a dummy string of the desired length in it by sending the control a <code>TCM_SETITEM</code> message, and writing the desired text in it at draw time. This is rather inconvenient and not a particularly nice hack.</p>

somewhere in-between. Cycles of 8 seconds, CPU 20-50%,

<hr>

<p>OK, I got past the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1373372"">first hurdle</a>. I have written a Perl
script that can generate a very large text file (e.g. 20 GB) and
is essentially just a number of:</p>

<pre><code>print NUMBERS_OUTFILE $line;
</code></pre>

<p>where $line is a long string  with a ""\n"" at the end.</p>

<p>When the Perl script starts the write rate is about 120 MB/s
(consistent between what is computed by the script,
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_Explorer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Process Explorer</a> and ""IO Write Bytes/sec"" for process Perl
in Performance Monitor.) and 100% CPU on the single core it
is running on. This rate is, I believe, higher than write
speed of the hard disk.</p>

<p>Then after some time (e.g. 20 seconds and 2.7 GB written)
the whole system becomes very unresponsive and CPU drops to
0%. This last for e.g. 30 seconds. The average write speed
over these two phases is consistent with the write speed of
the hard disk. The times and sizes mentioned in this
paragraph varies a lot from run to run. The range 1 GB
to 4.3 GB for the first phase has been observed so far.

<p>There are several of these cycles for a 9.2 GB text file

    var win = elementWithHref.ownerDocument.defaultView;
    var originalLocation = win.location.href;
    var originalHref = elementWithHref.href;

    elementWithHref.href = 'javascript:try { '

</code></pre>

<p>So let me fill in all the details here. </p>

<p><code>heuristic_estimate_of_distance</code> is the function &Sigma; d(x<sub>i</sub>) where d(.) is the Manhattan distance of each square x<sub>i</sub> from its goal state.</p>

<p>So the setup </p>

<pre><code>            1 2 3
            4 7 6
            8 5 
</code></pre>

<p>would have a <code>heuristic_estimate_of_distance</code> of 1+2+1=4 since each of 8,5 are one away from their goal position with d(.)=1 and 7 is 2 away from its goal state with d(7)=2.</p>

<p>The set of nodes that the A* searches over is defined to be the starting position followed by all possible legal positions. That is lets say the starting position <code>x</code> is as above:</p>

<pre><code>            x =
            1 2 3
            4 7 6
            8 5 
</code></pre>

<p>then the function <code>neighbor_nodes(x)</code> produces the 2 possible legal moves:</p>

<pre><code>            1 2 3
            4 7 
            8 5 6

            or

            1 2 3
            4 7 6
            8   5
</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>dist_between(x,y)</code> is defined as the number of square moves that took place to transition from state <code>x</code> to <code>y</code>. This is mostly going to be equal to 1 in A* always for the purposes of your algorithm.</p>

<p><code>closedset</code> and <code>openset</code> are both specific to the A* algorithm and can be implemented using standard data structures (priority queues I believe.) <code>came_from</code> is a data structure used
to reconstruct the solution found using the function <code>reconstruct_path</code> who's details can be found on wikipedia. If you do not wish to remember the solution you do not need to implement this.</p>

<p>Last, I will address the issue of optimality. Consider the excerpt from the A* wikipedia article:</p>

<p>""If the heuristic function h is admissible, meaning that it never overestimates the actual minimal cost of reaching the goal, then A* is itself admissible (or optimal) if we do not use a closed set. If a closed set is used, then h must also be monotonic (or consistent) for A* to be optimal. This means that for any pair of adjacent nodes x and y, where d(x,y) denotes the length of the edge between them, we must have:
h(x) &lt;= d(x,y) +h(y)""</p>

<p>So it suffices to show that our heuristic is admissible and monotonic. For the former (admissibility), note that given any configuration our heuristic (sum of all distances) estimates that each square is not constrained by only legal moves and can move freely towards its goal position, which is clearly an optimistic estimate, hence our heuristic is admissible (or it never over-estimates since reaching a goal position will always take <em>at least</em> as many moves as the heuristic estimates.)</p>

<p>The monotonicity requirement stated in words is:
""The heuristic cost (estimated distance to goal state) of any node must be less than or equal to the cost of transitioning to any adjacent node plus the heuristic cost of that node.""</p>

<p>It is mainly to prevent the possibility of negative cycles, where transitioning to an unrelated node may decrease the distance to the goal node more than the cost of actually making the transition, suggesting a poor heuristic.</p>

<p>To show monotonicity its pretty simple in our case. Any adjacent nodes x,y have d(x,y)=1 by our definition of d. Thus we need to show</p>

<p>h(x) &lt;= h(y) + 1 </p>

<p>which is equivalent to</p>

<p>h(x) - h(y) &lt;= 1</p>

<p>which is equivalent to </p>

<p>&Sigma; d(x<sub>i</sub>) - &Sigma; d(y<sub>i</sub>) &lt;= 1</p>

<p>which is equivalent to </p>

<p>&Sigma; d(x<sub>i</sub>) - d(y<sub>i</sub>) &lt;= 1</p>

<p>We know by our definition of <code>neighbor_nodes(x)</code> that two neighbour nodes x,y can have at most the position of one square differing, meaning that in our sums the term</p>

<p>d(x<sub>i</sub>) - d(y<sub>i</sub>) = 0 </p>

<p>for all but 1 value of i. Lets say without loss of generality this is true of i=k. Furthermore, we know that for i=k, the node has moved at most one place, so its distance to 
a goal state must be at most one more than in the previous state thus:</p>

<p>&Sigma; d(x<sub>i</sub>) - d(y<sub>i</sub>) = d(x<sub>k</sub>) - d(y<sub>k</sub>) &lt;= 1</p>

<p>showing monotonicity. This shows what needed to be showed, thus proving this algorithm will be optimal (in a big-O notation or asymptotic kind of way.)</p>

<p>Note, that I have shown optimality in terms of big-O notation but there is still lots of room to play in terms of tweaking the heuristic. You can add additional twists to it so that it is a closer estimate of the actual distance to the goal state, <em>however</em> you have to make <em>sure</em> that the heuristic is always an <em>underestimate</em> otherwise you loose optimality!</p>

<h2>EDIT MANY MOONS LATER</h2>

<p>Reading this over again (much) later, I realized the way I wrote it sort of confounds the meaning of optimality of this algorithm. </p>

<p>There are two distinct meanings of optimality I was trying to get at here:</p>

<p>1) The algorithm produces an optimal solution, that is the best possible solution given the objective criteria.</p>

<p>2) The algorithm expands the least number of state nodes of all possible algorithms using the same heuristic. </p>

<p>The simplest way to understand why you need admissibility and monotonicity of the heuristic to obtain 1) is to view A* as an application of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm on a graph where the edge weights are given by the node distance traveled thus far plus the heuristic distance. Without these two properties, we would have negative edges in the graph, thereby negative cycles would be possible and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm would no longer return the correct answer! (Construct a simple example of this to convince yourself.)</p>

<p>2) is actually quite confusing to understand. To fully understand the meaning of this, there are a lot of quantifiers on this statement, such as when talking about other algorithms, one refers to <code>similar</code> algorithms as A* that expand nodes and search without a-priori information (other than the heuristic.) Obviously, one can construct a trivial counter-example otherwise, such as an oracle or genie that tells you the answer at every step of the way. To understand this statement in depth I highly suggest reading the last paragraph in the History section on <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm#History"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a> as well as looking into all the citations and footnotes in that carefully stated sentence.</p>

<p>I hope this clears up any remaining confusion among would-be readers.</p>

<p>Could anyone explain to me what <code>ebp</code> and <code>esp</code> are in this context?</p>
<p>From what I see, I'd say the stack pointer points always to the top of the stack, and the base pointer to the beginning of the current function? Right?</p>
<hr />
<p>edit: I mean this in the context of Windows programs.</p>
<p><strong>edit2: And how does <code>eip</code> work, too?</strong></p>
<p><strong>edit3:</strong> I have the following code from MSVC++:</p>
<pre><code>var_C= dword ptr -0Ch
var_8= dword ptr -8
var_4= dword ptr -4
hInstance= dword ptr  8
hPrevInstance= dword ptr  0Ch
lpCmdLine= dword ptr  10h
nShowCmd= dword ptr  14h

<p>All of them seem to be dwords, thus taking 4 bytes each. So I can see there is a gap from <code>hInstance</code> to <code>var_4</code> of 4 bytes. What are they? I assume it is the return address, as can be seen in the diagram from Wikipedia.</p>
<hr />
<p>(editor's note: removed a long quote from Michael's answer, which doesn't belong in the question, but a followup question was edited in):</p>
<p>This is because the flow of the function call is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Push parameters (hInstance, etc.)</li>
<li>Call function, which pushes return address</li>
<li>Push ebp</li>
<li>Allocate space for locals</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My question (last one, I hope!) now is, what exactly happens from the instant I pop the arguments of the function I want to call up to the end of the prolog? I want to know how the ebp, esp evolve during those moments (I already understood how the prolog works, I just want to know what is happening after I pushed the arguments on the stack and before the prolog).</strong></p>

<p><code>ebp</code> is usually set to <code>esp</code> at the start of the function. Function parameters and local variables are accessed by adding and subtracting, respectively, a constant offset from <code>ebp</code>.  All x86 calling conventions define <code>ebp</code> as being preserved across function calls.  <code>ebp</code> itself actually points to the previous frame's base pointer, which enables stack walking in a debugger and viewing other frame's local variables to work.</p>
<p>Most function prologs look something like:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>push ebp      ; Preserve current frame pointer
mov  ebp, esp ; Create new frame pointer pointing to current stack top
sub  esp, 20  ; allocate 20 bytes worth of locals on stack.
</code></pre>
<p>Then later in the function you may have code like (presuming both local variables are 4 bytes)</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>mov  [ebp-4], eax   ; Store eax in first local
mov  ebx, [ebp - 8] ; Load ebx from second local
</code></pre>
<p>FPO or <em>frame pointer omission</em> optimization which you can enable will actually eliminate this and use <code>ebp</code> as another register and access locals directly off of <code>esp</code>, but this makes debugging a bit more difficult since the debugger can no longer directly access the stack frames of earlier function calls.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>For your updated question, the missing two entries in the stack are:</p>
<pre class=""lang-none prettyprint-override""><code>nShowCmd          = dword ptr +14h
hlpCmdLine        = dword ptr +10h

return address    = dword ptr +04h     &lt;==

var_4             = dword ptr -04h
var_8             = dword ptr -08h

<p>I am using 2 ObservableCollections to allow users to select whatever items they require (flexibility is the key here). The main issue is that I have <em>thousands</em> of items that are grouped in both listboxes. All in all the design works really well (with a few dozen items), but my stumbling block is when a user copies all the available items from the left to the right as the screen freezes (time to run on a different thread?).</p>

<p>Looking at ObservableCollection it lacks an AddRange method and there are various implementations available on the internet. I also know the CollectionChanged event is needlessly being fired as each item is copied over draining performance horribly.</p>

<p>It may well be that I have to allow users to choose from groups of over 10 000 items in the future, which sounds like a bad idea, but is non-negotiable as the grouping on the listbox (CollectionViewSource) works really well, but has the side effect of switching <em>off</em> the Virtualising of both the listboxes</p>

<p>What can I do to improve the performance when loading a listbox with thousands of items when databound to an ObservableCollection? Are there any AddRange type implementations that you would recommend? Is the only choice I have here to run this on a background thread which seems expensive because I am not loading data from a database? </p>

But it doesn't say much about what ""waiting for response"" exactly means :-(</p>

<p>Still, the timeline is <em>(quoting)</em> :</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>DNS Lookup</strong> - DNS resolution time</li>
<li><strong>Connection</strong> - elapsed time required to create a TCP connection</li>
<li><strong>Queuing</strong> - elapsed time spent in a browser queue waiting for a network connection</li>
<li><strong>Waiting For Response</strong> - waiting for a response from the server</li>
<li><strong>Receiving Data</strong> - elapsed time required to read entire response from the server <em>(and/or time required to read from cache)</em>.</li>
<li><strong>DomContentLoaded event</strong> - time when DomContentLoad event was fired <em>(since the beginning of the request, can be negative if the request has been started after the event)</em></li>
<li><strong>load event</strong> - time when page load event was fired <em>(since the beginning of the request, can be negative if the request has been started after the event)</em></li>
</ul>

<p><br>
So, I'm guessing that the ""waiting for response"" period is the time during which the browser has sent the request to the server, and has not received any response yet : it is ""waiting"" for some content beginning to arrive :</p>

<ul>
<li>the browser is no longer waiting for the network connection : the request is sent</li>
<li>and the browser is not yet reading response from the server.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
In the case of a server generating the whole page before beginning sending it to the browser, I suppose the ""waiting for response"" time would be correspond to :</p>

<ul>
<li>time for the request to travel from the browser to the server</li>
<li>plus time for the request to be processed by the server (ie, time to generate the whole page)</li>
<li>plus time for the first byte of data traveling from the server to the browser.</li>
</ul>

Hope this helps :-)</p>

"1405486","<p>I am seeing something odd with storing doubles in a dictionary, and am confused as to why.</p>

<p>Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>            Dictionary&lt;string, double&gt; a = new Dictionary&lt;string, double&gt;();
            a.Add(""a"", 1e-3);

            if (1.0 &lt; a[""a""] * 1e3)
                Console.WriteLine(""Wrong"");

            if (1.0 &lt; 1e-3 * 1e3)
                Console.WriteLine(""Wrong"");
</code></pre>

<p>The second if statement works as expected; 1.0 is not less than 1.0.  Now, the first if statement evaluates as true.  The very odd thing is that when I hover over the if, the intellisense tells me false, yet the code happily moves to the Console.WriteLine.</p>

<p>This is for C# 3.5 in Visual Studio 2008.</p>

<p>Is this a floating point accuracy problem?  Then why does the second if statement work?  I feel I am missing something very fundamental here.</p>

<p>Any insight is appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Edit2</strong> (Re-purposing question a little bit):</p>

<p>I can accept the math precision problem, but my question now is: why does the hover over evaluate properly?  This is also true of the immediate window.  I paste the code from the first if statement into the immediate window and it evaluates false.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>First of all, thanks very much for all the great answers.</p>

<p>I am also having problems recreating this in another project on the same machine.  Looking at the project settings, I see no differences.  Looking at the IL between the projects, I see no differences.  Looking at the disassembly, I see no apparent differences (besides memory addresses).  Yet when I debug the original project, I see:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/xm4wA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/xm4wA.png"" alt=""screenshot of problem""></a>
</p>

<p>The immediate window tells me the if is false, yet the code falls into the conditional.</p>

<p>At any rate, the best answer, I think, is to prepare for floating point arithmetic in these situations.  The reason I couldn't let this go has more to do with the debugger's calculations differing from the runtime.  So thanks very much to Brian Gideon and stephentyrone for some very insightful comments.</p>

"1414224","<p>I've got an iPhone app that I'm working on that uses Push Notifications. </p>

<p>In the payload I'm specifying a few things: </p>

<ul>
<li>message body</li>
<li>sound</li>
<li>action-loc-key because I don't want the user to be able to launch the app from the notification</li>
</ul>

<p>The notification is getting to my iPhone just fine. It shows a message without buttons. So body and action-loc-key are working just fine. But, it's not playing any sound. </p>

<p>However, there are a couple of things I've noticed during troubleshooting:</p>

<ol>
<li>if I implement application:didReceiveRemoteNotification, everything looks fine. The Dictionary argument contains a key for sound, whose value is indeed the name of the file I want to play. </li>
<li>The sound file itself ""works"" because if I play it inside of the app (using the SoundEffect class from the BubbleLevel sample) it works just fine. </li>
</ol>

<p>Despite these two facts, the sound effect simply isn't playing. </p>

<p>In the settings app, everything looks right - Push is turned on for my app, and I have both ""sounds"" and ""alerts"" set to on as well. </p>

<p>The iPhone documentation center suggests using Quicktime to look at the format of the file. This is what it looks like.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i7.photobucket.com/albums/y256/bpapa/Screenshot2009-09-11atSep1120091145.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Finally, if I look at the info for this file in XCode, it says the file type is simply the default, ""file."" From what I could tell there is no audio-caf option in the list. I tried audio-WAV (the sound engineer told me the original files were WAVs) but that didn't change anything. </p>

<p>In addition, the code:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)applicationDidFinishLaunching:(UIApplication *)application {

// view controller set up stuff
    // ...

[[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:(UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound)];

Here i need to synchronize local server database with main DB server(example: computers in office are connected to office server and they use it like a local server, so that no sync is required.BUT computers in other office work with their local server too and we need synchronization between the offices though the main DB server.). As i see i cant use SQLCompact here. Is there a provider to do the server-to-server synchronization right from the client? If no can someone provide a sample of solution of how to manage such situation?</p>

"1422343","<p>I'm trying to wrap my mind around the MVP pattern used in a C#/Winforms app. So I created a simple ""notepad"" like application to try to work out all the details. My goal is to create something that does the classic windows behaviors of open, save, new as well as reflecting the name of the saved file in the title bar. Also, when there are unsaved changes, the title bar should include an *. </p>

<p>So I created a view &amp; a presenter that manage the application's persistence state. One improvement I've considered is breaking out the text handling code so the view/presenter is truly a single-purpose entity.</p>

Then you could move the dialog creation logic from the view to the presenter.</p>

<p>This gets into the topic of communication between mvp triads, a topic which is usually glossed over when examining this pattern. What I've found works for me is to connect triads at their presenters.</p>

<pre><code>public class PersistenceStatePresenter
{
    ...
    public Save
    {
        string sFilename;

        if (_model.Filename == _model.DefaultName || _model.Filename == null)
        {
            var openDialogPresenter = new OpenDialogPresenter();
            openDialogPresenter.Show();
            if(!openDialogPresenter.Cancel)
            {
                return; // user canceled the save request.
            }
            else
                sFilename = openDialogPresenter.FileName;

        ...
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Show()</code> method, of course, is responsible for showing an unmentioned <code>OpenDialogView</code>, which would accept the users input and pass it along to the <code>OpenDialogPresenter</code>. In any case, it should be starting to become clear that a presenter is an elaborate middleman. Under different circumstances, you might be tempted to refactor a middleman out but here its is intentional to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keep logic out of the view, where it is harder to test</li>
<li>Avoid direct dependencies between the view and the model</li>
</ul>

<p>At times I've also seen the model used for MVP triad communication. The benefit of this is the presenter's don't need to know each other exist. Its usually accomplished by setting a state in the model, which triggers an event, which another presenter then listens for. An interesting idea. One I've not used personally.</p>

<p>Here's a few links with some of the techniques others have used to deal with triad communication:</p>

<p>And my question is of course how to fix this but I'm also curious why this is happening (I want to learn from it) I thought maybe i did something wrong but even if i cut/paste the example it's happening.</p>

<p>One little thing i noticed when reading the code was this comment in the CustomStroke class</p>

<pre><code>// Draw linear gradient ellipses between
// all the StylusPoints in the Stroke
</code></pre>

<p>Seems to me like it should draw ellipses between the points not only at the points.</p>

<p>I'm using C#.NET.</p>

<p>Again in short:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why is this happening</li>
<li>Help me fix it :) </li>
</ul>
","Custom InkCanvas (MSDN Code Sample not working properly)","<c#><wpf><inkcanvas>","2009-09-14 16:05:28","2987","1761010","3","<p><strong>Why this is happening</strong></p>

<p>The custom InkCanvas in the example draws an ellipse at every collected StrokePoint but makes no attempt to draw lines between them.  The standard InkCanvas control is implemented by drawing lines between the points it is given.  This is why the custom InkCanvas implementation from the example leaves gaps and the built-in one doesn't.</p>

<p><strong>How to ""fix"" it</strong></p>

<p>The custom code could easily be extended to not leave gaps:  In addition to drawing ellipses at each point, it could draw lines between each pair of points.</p>

<p>Code to draw connecting lines might be added before the code to draw the ellipses, like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Draw connecting lines
var geo = new StreamGeometry();
using(geoContext = geo.Open())
{
  geoContext.StartFigure(stylusPoints[0], false, false);
  geoContext.PolyLineTo(stylusPoints.Skip(1).Cast&lt;Point&gt;(), true, false);
}
drawingContext.DrawGeometry(null, connectingLinePen, geo);

// Draw ellipses
for(int i = 1; i &lt; stylusPoints.Count; i++)
{
  ... etc ...
</code></pre>

<p>This code works by constructing a polyline StreamGeometry and then drawing it to the context.  Using a StreamGeometry in this context is generally more efficient than creating a PathGeometry with a Polyline or doing a bunch of DrawLine calls directly on the drawingCanvas.</p>

<p>Note:  Using a better digitizer won't solve the underlying problem, which is that the custom InkCanvas is actually designed to only show data at the sampled points and not in between.</p>

"1422779","<p>I need help programatically graphing more points than can fit in a single Excel series.</p>

My customer requires plotting of maximum amount of points per chart due to the large data sets we work with.</p>

<p>I have moderate experience with C#/Excel interop so I thought it would be easy to programatically create a worksheet and then loop through each set of 32000 points and add them to the graph as a series, stopping when the data was fully plotted or 8 series were plotted.  If colored properly, the 8 series would be visually indistinguishable from a single series.</p>

"1424189","<p>I'm using ggplot2 to make some bullseye charts in R. They look delightful, and everyone is very pleased - except that they'd like to have the values of the bullseye layers plotted on the chart. I'd be happy just to put them in the lower-right corner of the plot, or even in the plot margins, but I'm having some difficulty doing this.</p>
<p>Here's the example data again:</p>
<pre><code>critters &lt;- structure(list(Zoo = &quot;Omaha&quot;, Animals = 50, Bears = 10, PolarBears = 3), .Names = c(&quot;Zoo&quot;, 
&quot;Animals&quot;, &quot;Bears&quot;, &quot;PolarBears&quot;), row.names = c(NA, -1L), class = &quot;data.frame&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>And how to plot it:</p>
<pre><code>d &lt;- data.frame(animal=factor(c(rep(&quot;Animals&quot;, critters$Animals),
       rep(&quot;Bears&quot;, critters$Bears), rep(&quot;PolarBears&quot;, critters$PolarBears)),
       levels = c(&quot;PolarBears&quot;, &quot;Bears&quot;, &quot;Animals&quot;), ordered= TRUE))
grr &lt;- ggplot(d, aes(x = factor(1), fill = factor(animal))) +  geom_bar() +
  coord_polar() + labs(x = NULL, fill = NULL) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;firebrick2&quot;, &quot;yellow2&quot;, &quot;green3&quot;)) +
  opts(title = paste(&quot;Animals, Bears and Polar Bears:\nOmaha Zoo&quot;, sep=&quot;&quot;))
</code></pre>
<p>I'd like to add a list to, say, the lower right corner of this plot saying,</p>
<pre><code>Animals: 50
Bears: 10
PolarBears: 3
</code></pre>
<p>But I can't figure out how. My efforts so far with <code>annotate()</code> have been thwarted, in part by the polar coordinates. If I have to add the numbers to the title, so be it - but I always hold out hope for a more elegant solution.</p>
<p>EDIT:
An important note for those who come after: the bullseye is a bar plot mapped to polar coordinates. The ggplot2 default for bar plots is, sensibly, to stack them. However, that means that the rings of your bullseye will also be stacked (e.g. the radius in my example equals the sum of all three groups, 63, instead of the size of the largest group, 50). I <strong>don't</strong> think that's what most people expect from a bullseye plot, especially when the groups are nested.  Using <code>geom_bar(position = position_identity())</code> will turn the stacked rings into layered circles.</p>

<p>edit: data formatters is on and it shows what you see above ...</p>
","Xcode 3.2 Debug: Seeing whats in an array?","<xcode><debugging>","2009-09-15 15:26:49","14755","1571095","3","<p>This is because GDB acts as if the variable you are viewing is out of scope while it really just is confused about what each part function or method call of the data formatter is returning (the data formatter is the ""{(unichar *)Xcode_CFStringSummary($VAR, $ID)}:s"" part you are seeing. 
When you are debugging and you are in a method where you know a local variable must be in scope right now, open the debugger window and the area where you can see ""Variable"", ""Value"" and ""Summary"" column titles double click the ""Summary"" row entry for the variable you are interested in and enter the following (for array types like NSArray or NSCFArray):</p>

<p>""{(int)[$VAR count]} objects {(NSString *)[(NSArray *)$VAR description]}:s""</p>

<p>then press return. You have now overwritten the default data formatter provided by Xcode's GDB extension (to be found in various plists at ""/Developer/Library/Xcode/CustomDataViews/"") with your own data formatter string. </p>

<p>Your own overrides are saved at ""~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/CustomDataViews/CustomDataViews.plist"" and if you want to have the Apple default data formatter back just double click the row for a variable of the same type and delete whatever is there. </p>

<p>The nitty-gritty details: In the custom expression above the ""{}"" construct tells GDB to execute a command (as if you where executing it from GDB's debugger command line, which means the same restrictions apply: you need to specify the return type in cast parens in front of every function or method which returns something). The "":s"" behind the closing curly brace tells Xcode and GDB to reference the ""Summary"" column. Also valid would be "":v"" which references the ""Value"" column which most of the time is just the pointer value. Everything that is outside of the curly braces is shown verbatim. 
Unfortuntely curly braces can't be nested which invalidates ternary operator conditionals.</p>

<p>So with the above data formatter you should see the following for an empty NSArray:</p>

<p>""0 objects (\n)""</p>

<p>If you want to write your own data formatters as GDB extensions (equivalent to specifying a function akin to Xcode_CFStringSummary above) you can do so. Take a look at the following header: ""/Developer/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/PlugIns/GDBMIDebugging.xcplugin/Contents/Headers/DataFormatterPlugin.h""</p>

<p>it will tell you all you need to know. But it can be hard to get it right. It might be easier and less error prone to just define another method on your class and call that from the data formatter string instead of ""description"".</p>

How would you validate the number of days in a given month?</p>
<p>My first thought was to make an array containing the days of a given month, with the index representing the month:</p>
<pre><code>var daysInMonth = [
    31, // January
    28, // February
    31, // March
    etc.
];
</code></pre>
<p>And then do something along the lines of:</p>
<pre><code>function validateDaysInMonth(days, month)
{
    if (days &lt; 1 || days &gt; daysInMonth[month]) throw new Error(&quot;Frack!&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>But... What about leap years? How can I implement checking for leap years and keep the function running relatively fast?

"1434306","<p>I have a customer who is currently using Excel to do their staff planning.  They have many workbooks for different projects and each project contains 1 or more sheets containing the actual staffing data:</p>

<p><img src=""https://sites.google.com/site/daveparillo/downloads/stackoverflow/staffing.gif?attredirects=0"" alt=""Sample staff planning sheet""></p>

<p>The customer wants to consolidate all of the data from all of these many sheets and workbooks into a single pivot table.  A 'consolidated' pivot is not an option because they want to be able to mess with all of the (non-date) fields in the source data.  They don't want to be limited to only 'Row' and 'Column'.  My current solution is a macro that consolidates all of the data within a workbook through a fairly convoluted copy and rotate process.  I copy a row of 'meta data' (everything that's not a date) first, then I copy / transpose the dates for the meta data row into a single 'Date' column.  Then I extend the meta data so that the same data is defined for each date.</p>

<p>I have a separate workbook that grabs the consolidated sheet from each workbook and builds a single pivot table from them.</p>

<p>It works, but it's pretty inefficient, since the total number of tasks / assignments number in the many thousands.  In my dreams, I would love to eliminate the consolidation step completely, but I don't see that happening.  A more efficient consolidation approach is about the best I'm hoping for at this point.</p>

<p>If anyone has some 'outside the box' ideas, I'm all ears!
The solutions needs to work on windows XP, Office 2002 and 2003.</p>

The clever parts seems to be that they are only using the division operation for the first ""digit"", a1, and avoid having to use the other a(x)'s in the same way by applying them in the next step by subtracting their product (against the partial quotient) from the interim remainder.</p>

<p>That this can validly be done and that it always works is probably due to the fact that the ""digits"" (base 100, in this case) aren't real digits and can legitimately assume values both greater than their base (i.e., over 100) and even less than zero.  This allows greater flexibility in the timing of the application of each ""digit"" to the operation like, for instance, deferring the application of the secondary digits of the divisor (a(x>1)) until after a partial quotient is created from the prior step's division by a(1), which in turn allows them to be applied as a product subtraction, rather than a division operation.</p>

"1457005","<p>I'm having some trouble programmatically causing an HTML checkbox object to become highlighted after gaining focus. Here is a simple example of the code I'm using:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    function doIt(){
        document.getElementById(""theCheckbox"").focus();
    }
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;input type=""button"" onClick=""doIt()"" value=""Push Me""&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;input type=""checkbox"" id=""theCheckbox""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Clicking the ""Push Me"" button causes the checkbox to gain focus. I know this because the checkbox becomes checked if you hit the spacebar after clicking the button. However, at no point is the checkbox highlighted. The type of highlighting I'm talking about appears to work in IE naturally under the following circumstances...</p>

<p>Press the Tab key until the ""Push Me"" button is outlined in a dotted line. Now click the ""Push Me"" button again. The checkbox should be outlined in the dotted line I'm trying to programmatically create (without having to mess around by hitting the Tab key first).</p>

<p>Image of the desired effect that I can only seem to achieve after messing with the Tab key:</p>

<p>This fails because I receive an ""Ext is not defined"" error in Firebug. I basically copied the example, I only used a newer version of Ext. First of all the css and scripts are included:</p>

&lt;script src=""scripts/ux/Ext.ux.TinyMCE.js"" type=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Firebug does not complain, all the scripts are found on the specified paths and are included.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    console.log(""Ready..."");
    Ext.onReady(function() {
        console.log(""set..."");
        Ext.get(""cmdOpen"").on(""click"", function() {
            console.log(""GO"");
            var dlg = new Ext.Window({

<p>The console.log(""Ready..."") shows up in the console, then the code breaks. There are four references to ""Ext is not defined"", in ext-all.js(), miframe-min.js(), Ext.ux.TinyMCE.js() and in the code in the .aspx file. (Default.aspx)</p>

"1466533","<p>We're about to design an inhouse industry network consisting basically of the following: 1 server connected via wire to up to 100 proprietary RF access points (basically embedded devices), which each can be connected via radio to up to 100 endpoint embedded devices. Something like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Cir0l.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Cir0l.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>Now, I'm wondering about some design decisions that we need to take and I'm sure there are plenty of similar designs out there and lots of folks with experiences of them, both good and bad. Maybe you can chime in?</p>

<p>All endpoint devices are independent and will communicate their own unique data to the server, and the other way around. The server therefore needs to be able to target each endpoint device individually. Each endpoint device pairs itself with 1 access point and then talks a proprietary RF protocol to it, TCP/IP is not an option there.</p>

<p>The server will know which endpoint device is paired with which access point, so when the server needs to talk to an individual endpoint device, the communication must go through the paired access point. Hence, the server needs to directly address the access point.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> Considering the limited resources available in the proprietary access point, is TCP/IP between server and access point recommended for this scenario? Or would you suggest something entirely different?</p>

<p>If this isn't its own network and the server to AP link is running on your internal company network, there isn't really an option, there must be a TCP/IP stack on the AP.</p>

<p>If this is its own isolated network then what is the router for?</p>

<p>If this is, in fact, its own isolated network then you are right, there really isn't a need for the Ethernet connectivity at all.  The overhead you will see on the wireless is huge, your no overhead ideal data rate is 250kbit/sec, running ZigBee on 802.15.4 @ 2.4ghz point to point your real data throughout is usually around 20kbit/sec. A custom protocol should be able to obtain lower overhead but this would need to be defined. </p>

<p>If I were designing this I would choose a SoC for the AP that had on board 802.15.4 and CAN (Controller Area Network).  Depending on size and data rate just get a PCI CAN card for the server and connect it up, use something like DeviceNet as your protocol layer for server to AP communications.  This can be expanded by using CAN switches and repeaters.  CAN is used all the time in industrial automation, a little googling can find you example of tens of thousands of nodes used in some manufacturing plants.</p>

"1471479","<p>We are using builder pattern to generate test data. These domain objects have relations between them. Our functional tests require these objects to be persisted.</p>

<p>Think about this model:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/xbbFB.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/xbbFB.png"" alt=""domain model""></a>
</p>

<p>If I want a plain instance of C I do <code>aNew().c().build()</code></p>

<p>If I want it to be persisted I do <code>aNew().c().saveIn(session)</code></p>

<p>If I want an instance of C with a known B I do <code>aNew().c().with(b).build()</code></p>

<p>Well, you got the idea. My problem is, if I want to persist a C, should it persist it's B? Or should it be persisted before hand? What about if I want a reasonable default B? What about if I want to persist a D? Should it persist all A, B, C?</p>

<p>Of course real system is much more complex (sometimes with circular references). I am looking for a best practice for persisting complex test data.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> It looks like I have bumped into the language barrier, my mother language is not English, so I am sorry for obscurity. Here is more information:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is not legacy code that I am trying to test</li>
<li>I am trying to write a coverage test, NOT a unit test (as a result I won't be mocking anything)</li>
<li>The piece of software I am trying to test works if the database is populated to some extend (it does not use all entities).</li>
</ul>

<p>PS. Please don't hesitate to ask for more information, because I have been struggling to find the possible best practice. The closest thing I have come up with is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Keep track of what has been set explicitly while building an entity.</li>
<li>Assume that explicitly set entities are already persisted, do not persist them.</li>
<li>Persist everything else (with their own persister).</li>
</ol>

<p>This will work, but my spider sense is tingling, I think I am doing something wrong because, there will be logic involved in test code, it will be very complex to deal with without tests.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I will try to make myself more clear. When I am writing/running my unit and some integration tests I have no problem, because the test data are not persisted, it lives in memory.</p>

<p>But when I try to persist my test data, hibernate will not let me save an entity without it's relations.</p>

<p>How can I overcome this problem?</p>
","Persisting complex test data","<testing><persistence><fluent-interface><test-data>","2009-09-24 12:47:45","790","1498386","6","<p>You need to define your cascades on the domain better. If you can't test it, how do you expect it will perform in the real application?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>A -> B: Who's the owner of this relationship? Do you want to add B to A, or the other way around? This can be an implementation detail where you can have both B.SetParent(A) and A.Children.Add(B), and where you set B's parent to A in case of A.Children.Add(B) (likewise the other way around). What happens if you do:</p>

<pre><code>A a1 = new A();
A a2 = new A();
B b = new B();
a1.Children.Add(b);
b.SetParent(a);
</code></pre>

<p>You need to make up your mind here. None of the solutions are perfect, so it's basically personal preference and app consistency that applies here.</p>

<p>Working with ORMs you get into these constraint problems faster then with plain SQL (or any other datasource like XML or your own datasource), but you'd need to consider the problems if you were to write plain SQL too.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, I don't have an definite answer for you, but to me it looks like you need to consider some constraints which (I presume) you haven't done yet.</p>

<p>Personally, I like the repository-pattern when dealing using NHibernate in DALs. I make my repositories implement from IDisposable and let them get a session each. This way you get the ""Unit of work""-pattern into your design.</p>

<p><strong>Discussion:</strong></p>

<p>The only thing that shows up when I run this is the <code>DataGrid</code> of users and the buttons (""Add New User"" and ""Delete User"") below it. There is no <code>Expander</code> or title bar. Also, even if I did see one, I'm not sure how to set up a <code>Binding</code> for the title that appears on the title bar. I know how to do bindings if I use <code>ItemsSource</code>, but I wanted to set my items declaratively.</p>

<p><strong>The question:</strong></p>

<p>How should I go about this? I'm looking for either a fix for what I have now or a clean-sheet solution.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>What I ended up doing was replacing the <code>ItemsControl</code> with a <code>StackPanel</code> and just writing a style for my expanders. This proved to be much simpler, and there really was no benefit to the <code>ItemsControl</code> since I needed to declare custom content for each item anyway. The one issue remaining was how to achieve a custom title for each expander. That's where @Thomas Levesque's suggestion to use <code>TemplateBinding</code> came in. All I had to do was replace <code>Text=""Title_Of_Expander_Goes_Here""</code> in my header's template (see code above) with <code>Text=""{TemplateBinding Content}""</code>.</p>

"1479980","<p>My inner loop contains a calculation that profiling shows to be problematic.</p>

<p>The idea is to take a greyscale pixel x (0 &lt;= x &lt;= 1), and ""increase its contrast"". My requirements are fairly loose, just the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>for x &lt; .5, 0 &lt;= f(x) &lt; x</li>
<li>for x > .5, x &lt; f(x) &lt;= 1</li>
<li>f(0) = 0</li>

    i = 1 - i;
    return 1 - i * i * 2;

<p>And the postorder traversal yields - 8, 9, 4, 5, 2, 6, 7, 3, 1</p>

<p>So for instance, if we want to find the common ancestor of nodes 8 and 5, then we make a list of all the nodes which are between 8 and 5 in the inorder tree traversal, which in this case happens to be [4, 9, 2]. Then we check which node in this list appears last in the postorder traversal, which is 2. Hence the common ancestor for 8 and 5 is 2.</p>

<p>The complexity for this algorithm, I believe is O(n) (O(n) for inorder/postorder traversals, the rest of the steps again being O(n) since they are nothing more than simple iterations in arrays). But there is a strong chance that this is wrong. :-)</p>

<p>But keep in mind that if your nodes have parent pointers, an improved algorithm is possible. For both nodes in question construct a list containing the path from root to the node by starting at the node, and front inserting the parent.</p>

<p>So for 8 in your example, you get (showing steps): {4}, {2, 4}, {1,  2, 4}</p>

<p>This algorithm requires O(h) time where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case O(h) is equivalent to O(n), but if the tree is balanced, that is only O(log(n)). It also requires O(h) space.

"1484927","<p>I want to setup my WinForm to look like the Delphi7 IDE. Basically that means the window has no background (the desktop shows through), and child windows float around.</p>

<p>You may be implementing the floating windows as UserControls in the main form's Controls collection.  If so, there are two ways you can deal with this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Implement the floating windows as actual windows.  Show them using ""frmToolWindows.Show(this);"" (this will keep them always on top of your main form).</li>
<li>If you need to keep the floaters as UserControls, you can make the client area of your main form transparent by setting the form's TransparencyKey property to some arbitrary color (Color.Red, for example) and then setting the form's BackColor property to the same color.  This will make your form transparent and able to be clicked through.</li>

        return this.Context.saw_order

When I did this, I was able to check the MySQL server and verify that the query was in fact sent to the MySQL server and the MySQL server was ""Writing to NET"" and trying to send data back.  The query sent from my test machine was valid.</p>

<p>From my test above, it seems that data is correctly being sent to the MySQL server but is lost somewhere on its return.  My difficulty now is trying to figure out where in the chain (Entity Framework to RIA Services to Silverlight client) the data is getting lost and I'm not sure how to debug this at different points.</p>

<p>For example, what are other ways I might test Entity Framework to make sure EF is not the problem?  How might I test RIA services?  Should I test on the Silverlight Client?</p>

<p>I'm struggling with learning C# and am not sure what to do to test.  How might I ""catch"" the return in the DomainService so I can do some basic debugging.</p>

<p>Any help is very much appreciated.</p>

<p>What you're doing is right, your code would be applied to each repository.</p>

<p>As you stated, the purpose of the Repository pattern is so you can interchange the way the data is delivered to your application without having to refactor your code in your application (UI/delivery layer).</p>

<p>Take for example, you decide to switch to Linq to Entities or ADO.NET. </p>

<p>All you would need is to write the code for the ORM you'll be using (having it inherit the proper Interface), then have your code use that repository. Of course you would need replace all references of the old repository or rename/replace your old ORM repositories so that your application uses the proper ones (Unless you're using some type of IoC container, in which you would specify which repository to pass).</p>

<p>The rest of your application would continue to run properly since all the methods you used to get/edit your data will return the proper objects. </p>

<p>In layman's term, the repositories will give your application the data it needs the same way. The only difference is how that data is retrieved from your database (ADO.NET/Linq to something etc.) </p>

<p>Having your classes inherit the Repository Interfaces is a hard-constraint making sure they output the data in a uniform fashion that agrees with the way your application uses it.</p>

<p>I'm developing a web app in ASP.NET which displays a lot of data from various languages - things like names, locations, etc.  If the user has Google Toolbar, it recognises the page variously as Italian, Spanish, etc, depending on exactly which data items they are looking at, and pops up a prompt offering to translate it.</p>

Next to the two columns are sensor attribute data that is yellowed under (AB,BC,AC).  My code below is supposed to look at athe attribute cells and see under which columns (AB,BC,AC) are yellow. Then it takes the key pairs (key 1, key2) and finds a match in the three column matrix in terms of values and the relative order of the value in the three columns.  I've been doing this manually and its so much of a pain I need to try to code it but I don't know if its possible.  The problem I have is that the yellowed cells tells the relative order of the key pairs to find the match in the three columns and I do not know how to pull that off.  </p>

The simplest solution is to add a button with the caption ""highlight matrix"" that walks through your sensordata and highlights the found rows in the matrix. </p>

<p>End Sub</p>

<p>Its not the most efficient way to solve this problem but it should be fine with small worksheets.</p>

<p><strong>Adding more Sensors:</strong>
The array/collection yellowRows stores the rownumbers of every key1/key2 combination that has at least one yellow sensor value. If you want to add other sensors, u could add the columns after the current 6 sensor rows (C - H) and set the matrix row to the new column position e. g. 13 instead of 10 and set iColumn &lt;= 11 instead of 8 if u add 1 new sensor with 3 columns.</p>

<p><strong>Adding more Matrices:</strong>
To add more matrices u simply need to add a matrix in the given layout anywhere and define a new range for the matrix e.g.</p>

<pre><code>Set Matrix2 = Worksheets.Item(1).Cells(100, 1).CurrentRegion 'Matrix 2 starts in the 100. row on the 1. spreadsheet in the 1. column'
</code></pre>

<p>then just copy+paste the for loop of your original matrix(and change Matrix.Rows in Matrix2.Rows) in the yellowRows loops (now u have 2 Loops in your yellowRows loop)</p>

<p><strong>Regarding your Sample file:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>There was a ""End Sub"" at the start of
the Sub that needed to be deleted</li>
<li>The Matrix range was set wrong</li>
<li>the sensordata should start at column</li>
<li><p>Because you have an id column the line</p>

<pre><code>   If Row.Cells(1, 1) = Worksheets.Item(1).Cells(Item, 1) And Row.Cells(1, 2) = Worksheets.Item(1).Cells(Item, 2) Then ' color found rows red '
</code></pre>

<p>changes to</p>

<pre><code>   If Row.Cells(1, 1) = Worksheets.Item(1).Cells(Item, 2) And Row.Cells(1, 2) = Worksheets.Item(1).Cells(Item, 3) Then ' color found rows red '
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>the column loop should start at 5 and
end at 16</p></li>
</ul>

"
"1513411","<p>User would open the app and it would ask if User wants to use the camera or use a saved picture.
If user selects camera, it would link with the camera view so that they can immediately take a picture. 
Application would present the user with an outline of a human body so as to match up with a subject they wish to photograph.
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/XVlGZ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/XVlGZ.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>Example – this would be clear except for the outline of the body and the user would be able to move the phone or have the subject move until they closely fit into the shape seen above. Once in position the subject would be photographed and the resulting photo WOULD NOT display the outline above. It is used for targeting and alignment only. Once photo is taken a set of clothing could be held up and the same outline above could be used to align the clothes within the shape and photographed thus allowing the two photos to be merged and the subject would see what the clothing would look like on them.
Application would then eliminate all of the image out side the body image. In more specific terms would isolate the subject from the subject’s surroundings. The result would be the subject alone in a blank field.
Now that subject is isolated application would allow for other images to be placed over subject image. (example: new clothes could be imaged in a similar manner as the subject and dragged on to the isolated image.</p>

<p>ok thanks for your answer.it really helps me alot..</p>

<p>now tell me if these functions are possible</p>

<p>Application will allow for adding isolated subject onto a background imaged stored on the iphone. (example: subject is photographed in San Francisco but background is replaced to make it appear subject is in New York City.
All functions described above should be available to be employed with stored images as well.
Image of subject should be able to be “morphed” to appear heavier or thinner.</p>

<p>Below are some additional desired features which are price sensitive – please provide an estimate based on adding some of these features. If a feature is listed below and it appears above please disregard.
Once photo is taken, app would ask user if they want to cut the head, replace the outfit or ""try on"". This would drive the subsequent actions.
If cut head is selected
User would circle the outline of the head and the app would cut out the image of the head and save to the side
User would then select another body from the picture, from a body template, or body from another saved/stored photo.
Once body is selected, user would touch the saved head and it will automatically fill on to the body.
If outfit is selected
User would touch key body parts such as the two shoulders, hands, waist, legs and feet from left to right. This would allow the app to know how best to superimpose the outfit.
User would then select an outfit from the many available templates
Once selected, user would hit a confirm type of button and this would put the new outfit on to the body.
The outfit should conform to the person's body in the photo. i.e. stretch side ways to make the person fatter, make thinner, shorter, longer, etc. 
If app could be aware of spatial alignment, that would be ideal. i.e. if someone is turned to the side, the replaced outfit would be a side view. 
Another feature should be is for the user to manually alter the photo with the new outfit to make the person look taller, shorter, skinnier, fatter, etc. 
App would also have option pose for frontal and rear view photo 
In the camera view when this option is selected, a standard body outline would show in the frame. The user would try and match as closely as possibly the subject to the body outline shown in the frame. Once closely matched, user would take the phone of the frontal and rear view of the subject. 
At clothing stores, the user can take a front and back photo of the clothes and have it superimposed to the ""posed"" photo of the body they took. 
User would open the app, and it would start as outlined in the first bullet point above
User would select the camera option
User would take the photo of the front and back of the clothing
Once photo taken, app would ask if they want to cut the head, replace the outfit, or try on..
User selects try on
App asks if it's a top, bottom, or both AND if user wants frontal/rear view of the clothing
User touches key points of the outfit as needed, ie. shoulders, wrist, waist, etc.
Once key points touched and confirmed, app automatically fits the clothing into the saved/posed photo
App would need to conform the clothing photo to the user's body shape and type.
The app should work for saved pictures as well. ie stores have pictures online and the user is able to copy and save the clothing photo from the store's website to their iphone and use this feature the same.</p>
","photo editing app are these functions possible?","<objective-c><xcode><iphone-sdk-3.0><image-processing>","2009-10-03 10:23:15","5512","1513431","1","<p>The targetting part can be easily done in 3.1, you’ll simply set a view with a transparent body image as the custom camera view (<a href=""http://developer.apple.com/IPhone/library/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIImagePickerController_Class/UIImagePickerController/UIImagePickerController.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UIImagePickerController/cameraOverlayView"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">setCameraOverlayView</a> docs). The body outline will only be visible in the view finder, not on the photograph. Once you have the image aligned, you can then separate the body image from the background using a PNG mask image with an alpha channel. This image would only show the parts that fall inside the body outline, and you can also have a decent feather on the border. I am just not sure about the quality of the resulting image, the aligning is bound to be pretty imprecise.</p>

"1513811","<p>I started playing around with OpenGL and GLUT. I would like to draw some points, but the problem is that they turn out to be squares, and I would like them to be round dots (filled circles).</p>

<p>This is what I do:</p>

<pre><code>void onInitialization( ) 
{ 
    glEnable( GL_POINT_SMOOTH );
    glEnable( GL_BLEND );
    glBlendFunc( GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA );
    glPointSize( 6.0 );
}    

void onDisplay()
{
    glClearColor( 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f );
    glClear( GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT );

    glBegin( GL_POINTS );
        glColor3f( 0.95f, 0.207, 0.031f );
    for ( int i = 0; i &lt; g_numPoints; ++i )
    {
        glVertex2f( g_points[i].X, g_points[i].Y );
    }
    glEnd();
    glFinish();
    glutSwapBuffers();
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the result:
<img src=""https://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1470243/Screenshot-5.jpg"" alt=""Result of the above code""></p>

<p>The points show up where expected, only their shape is wrong.</p>
","Getting smooth, big points in OpenGL","<c><opengl><glut>","2009-10-03 14:00:07","56424","1513979","3","<p>Unlike what was said previously, this is possible with the fixed-function pipeline, even with the <code>GL_POINTS</code> primitive type, as long as you have support for OpenGL 1.4 or the <code>GL_ARB_point_sprite</code> extension. Consult this document, or the OpenGL core specification of your choice : <a href=""http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/point_sprite.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/point_sprite.txt</a></p>

<p><code>GL_ARB_point_sprite</code> converts points into ""quads"", i.e a polygon with the form of a plane. The exact primitive type it gets converted to is not defined by the specification, though it is not important. What is important is that <code>GL_COORD_REPLACE</code> auto-generates texture coordinates for the surface when enabled, so you can texture-map them with a sphere-shaped RGBA-texture.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: It seems like you (the poster) is right.</strong> Anti-aliased points get rounded with respect to their radius. (I've used OpenGL since 2003, and I didn't know this. [/shame])
So enabling <code>GL_POINT_SMOOTH</code> while you have a <code>multisample-able</code> visual/pixelformat, you get rounded points. Still, multisampling can be slow, so I'd implement both. Textured quads are cheap.</p>

<p><strong>To request a visual with multisampling with XLib</strong>, use these two attributes in the list to glXChooseFBConfig():</p>

<p><code>GLX_SAMPLE_BUFFERS</code> - its value should be <code>True</code>. This is an on/off toggle.<br/>
<code>GLX_SAMPLES</code> - the number of samples.</p>

<p><strong>To request a pixelformat with Win32</strong>, use these two attributes in the list to ChoosePixelFormat() or wglChoosePixelFormatARB():</p>

<p><code>WGL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS_ARB</code> Same as above, a toggle.<br/>
<code>WGL_SAMPLES_ARB</code> Same as above, the number of samples.</p>

<p><strong>It seem that you can OR in the flag <code>GLUT_MULTISAMPLE</code> to <code>glutInitDisplayMode</code> to get multisampling in GLUT</strong>, but you can't request the number of sample buffers.</p>

<p>Here is how alpha-blended quads could be implemented using your test case.</p>

<pre><code>void onInitialization( ) 
{
    glEnable( GL_POINT_SPRITE ); // GL_POINT_SPRITE_ARB if you're
                                 // using the functionality as an extension.

    glEnable( GL_POINT_SMOOTH );
    glEnable( GL_BLEND );
    glBlendFunc( GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA );
    glPointSize( 6.0 );

    /* assuming you have setup a 32-bit RGBA texture with a legal name */
    glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0);
    glEnable( GL_TEXTURE_2D );
    glTexEnv(GL_POINT_SPRITE, GL_COORD_REPLACE, GL_TRUE);
    glTexEnv(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL_REPLACE);
    glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, texture_name);

<p>Their explanation on this misleading error message is as following</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note:
  It is recognized that the
  message for Msg 313 is misleading and
  does not convey the actual cause of
  the failure. This awkward usage stems
  from the inability to raise an
  explicit error from within a TVF.
  Nevertheless, the value of returning a
  recognizable, if inaccurate, error was
  deemed preferable to simply returning
  an empty result. An empty result set
  would not be distinguishable from a
  valid query returning no changes.</p>

<p>This cuts out the highest 20 frequencies. Be careful to cut them out symmetrically otherwise the inverse transform is no longer real.

"1516141","<p>What is the syntax to use the [TestDescriptionAttribute][1] of a test to populate the Description column in the Test Results window?</p>

<p>Context:  Visual Studio 2008 Team System</p>

<p>I've read the documentation, but am not able to find a concrete example.</p>

<p>Based, loosely, on Ngu's suggestion, I've tried:</p>

<pre><code>using GlobalSim;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.WebTesting;

namespace GlobalSimTests {

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    ///This is a test class for PongerTest and is intended

    [TestClass()]
    [TestDescriptionAttribute( ""hello"" )]
    public class PongerTest {

        private TestContext testContextInstance;

        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        ///Gets or sets the test context which provides
        ///information about and functionality for the current test run.
        ///&lt;/summary&gt;
        public TestContext TestContext {
            get {
                return testContextInstance;
            }
            set {
                testContextInstance = value;
            }
        }

        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        ///A test for Ping
        ///&lt;/summary&gt;
        [TestMethod()]
        public void PingTest () {
            Ponger target = new Ponger();
            string expected = ""Pong"";
            string actual;
            actual = target.Ping();
            Assert.AreEqual( expected, actual );
        }

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This compiles, but doesn't display the test description in the Description column of the Test Results window.</p>

<p><img src=""https://farm3.static.flickr.com/2423/3979975988_b079e8b7d4_o.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I've also tried this syntax:</p>

<pre><code>    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    ///A test for Ping
    ///&lt;/summary&gt;
    [TestMethod()]
    [TestDescription( ""hello"" )]
    public void PingTest () {
        Ponger target = new Ponger();
        string expected = ""Pong"";
        string actual;
        actual = target.Ping();
        Assert.AreEqual( expected, actual );
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Which returns from the compiler:</p>

<p>Attribute 'TestDescription' is not valid on this declaration type. It is only valid on 'class' declarations.</p>

<p>Here is the syntax that works.  Thanks all!</p>

<pre><code>    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    ///A test for Ping
    ///&lt;/summary&gt;
    [TestMethod()]
    [Description( ""Hello"" )]
    public void PingTest () {
        Ponger target = new Ponger();
        string expected = ""Pong"";
        string actual;
        actual = target.Ping();

We're working with Python novices, and had to help a few through exactly what you're asking!  </p>

<p><strong>Command-line Python in Windows:</strong> </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Save your python code file somewhere, using ""Save"" or ""Save as"" in your editor.  Lets call it 'first.py' in some folder, like ""pyscripts"" that you make on your Desktop.</p></li>
<li><p>Open a <strong>prompt</strong> (a Windows 'cmd' shell that is a text interface into the computer):   </p>

<p>start > run > ""cmd"" (in the little box).  OK.     </p></li>
<li><p>Navigate to where your python file is, using the commands 'cd' (change directory) and 'dir' (to show files in the directory, to verify your head).  For our example something like, </p>

<p>> cd C:\Documents and Settings\Gregg\Desktop\pyscripts</p></li>
<li><p>try:</p>

</ol>

<p>If you get this message:  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'python' is not recognized as an
  internal or external command, operable
  program or batch file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>then <strong>python</strong> (the <em>interpreter</em> program that can translate Python into 'computer instructions') isn't on your path (see Putting Python in Your Path below).  Then try calling it like this (assuming Python2.6, installed in the usual location):</p>

<p>> C:\Python26\python.exe first.py</p>

<p>(Advanced users:  instead of first.py, you could write out first.py's full path of C:\Documents and Settings\Gregg\Desktop\pyscripts\first.py)</p>

<p><strong>Putting Python In Your Path</strong></p>

<p><em>Windows</em></p>

<p>In order to run programs, your operating system looks in various places,
and tries to match the name of the program / command you typed with some 
programs along the way.  </p>

<p>In windows:</p>

<p>control panel > system >  advanced > |Environmental Variables| > system variables -> Path</p>

<p>this needs to include:  C:\Python26; (or equivalent).  If you put it at the front,
it will be the first place looked.  You can also add it at the end, which is possibly saner.</p>

<p>Then restart your prompt, and try typing 'python'.  If it all worked, you should
get a "">>>"" prompt.</p>

<pre><code>public class TitledPanel extends Widget {
private Element legend;
private Widget content = null;

public TitledPanel() {
    Element fieldset = DOM.createFieldSet();

  <p>This paper is an atypical exercice in

  and understood by anybody  who
  understands the programming language

  Bailey-Borwein-Ploue formula for &pi;
  in a co-recursive,  incremental way
  which produces the digits 3, 1, 4, 1,
  5, 9. . . until the  memory
  exhaustion. This is not a way to
  proceed if somebody needs  many
  digits! Our coding strategy is
  perverse and dangerous, and it 
  provably breaks down. It is based on
  the arithmetics over the domain  of
  infinite sequences of digits
  representing proper fractions expanded
  in an integer base. We show how to
  manipulate: add, multiply by an 
  integer, etc. such sequences from the
  left to the right ad infinitum, 
  which obviously cannot work in all
  cases because of ambiguities. Some 
  deep philosophical consequences are
  discussed in the conclusions.</p>

    padding:0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>which is a universal reset that removes padding and margin from everything.  As I said on Doctype.com.</p>

<p>You will need to remove that, and use a more controllable reset, or <strong>set some default padding and margins for ul's and li's in general.</strong></p>

<p>As every browser seems to have different defaults for ul's I tend to omit them from my reset and set nav ul's specifically.</p>

<p>here's the reset I use:</p>

<pre><code>div, span, applet, object, iframe,
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, p, blockquote, pre,
abbr, acronym, address, big, cite, code,
del, dfn, font, img, ins, kbd, q, s, samp,
small, strike, sub, sup, tt, var,
fieldset, form, label, legend,
table, caption, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr, th, td {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    border: 0;
    outline: 0;
    font-weight: inherit;
    font-style: inherit;
    font-size: 100%;
    font-family: inherit;
    vertical-align: baseline;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>which resets almost everything other than lists.</p>

","Where are these dots coming from? How to get rid of them?","<visual-studio-2008><ide>","2009-10-06 13:15:27","809","1525523","1","<p>Those dots represent space characters.  You will also see little arrows for tabs, and little hooked arrows for carriage returns.</p>

<p>Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> to toggle the dots you're seeing.</p>

<p>BTW this is a standard Visual Studio feature.  It has nothing to do with CodeRush or any other plugin.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> As Martin points out, you could press <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>, then <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd>.  Personally I press CTRL then hold it down for the R &amp; W keystrokes.  It's less typing.</p>

"1526767","<p>What is the proper way to implement Custom Properties in Silverlight UserControls?</p>
<p>Every &quot;Page&quot; in Silverlight is technically a UserControl (they are derived from the UserControl class).  When I say UserControl here, I mean a Custom UserControl that will be used inside many different pages in many different scenarios (similar to an ASP.NET UserControl).</p>
<p>I would like the Custom UserControl to support Binding and not rely on the Name of the Property it is binding to, to always be the same.  Instead, I would like the UserControl itself to have a property that the Controls inside the UserControl bind to, and the ViewModels outside the UserControl also bind to.  (please see the example below)</p>
<p>Binding within the UserControl works, Binding within the MainPage works, The Binding I set up between the MainPage and the UserControl does not work.  Specifically this line:</p>
<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;myUserControls:MyCustomUserControl x:Name=&quot;MyCustomControl2&quot; 
    SelectedText=&quot;{Binding MainPageSelectedText, Mode=TwoWay}&quot; 
    Width=&quot;200&quot; Height=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;

","Silverlight UserControl Custom Property Binding","<silverlight><binding><user-controls>","2009-10-06 16:46:26","18857","1542435","3","<p>I understand it as the reason your control is not receiving the new value from the maim page is that you are setting the DataContext of the control. If you hadn't then the control's DataContext will be inherited from its parent, the main page in this case.</p>

<p>To get this to work I removed you control's DataContext setting, added an x:Name to each control and set the binding in the constructor of the control using the [name].SetBinding method.</p>

<p>I did the binding in the ctor as I couldn't figure out a way of setting the Source property of the declarative binding in the xaml to Self. i.e. {Binding SelectedText, Mode=TwoWay, Source=[Self here some how]}. I did try using RelativeSource={RelativeSource Self} with no joy.</p>
