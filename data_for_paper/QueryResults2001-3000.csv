"2481249","<p>I'm trying to format an RDLC report file in Visual Studio 2008 and I am having a formatting issue. I have a list at the bottom that contains a matrix that expands horizontally to the right. That pink box is just to visualize the problem I'm having. </p>

<p>When the report is rendered the matrix expands and instead of filling the pink box with the matrix is pushes the space in the pink box to the right resulting in an extra page when printing the reports.</p>

<p>One solution would be to shrink the pink box to be the size of the matrix which I've done. But then when the matrix grows the fields at the top of the report get pushed to the right by the same amount as the growth of the matrix. </p>

<p>Can someone please let me know what they think the solution would be? Thank you!</p>

<p>1) Get the bounding box of your entire tiling - which is min(x), min(y) to max(x), max(y) for all x and y of your tiles</p>

<p>2) For every row, start with STATE==EMPTY, iterate over each column : STATE changes to FULL when you hit a square, and EMPTY when you find a hole. Every time STATE goes from EMPTY to FULL, save the left hand line segment of that square and every time STATE goes from FULL to EMPTY, save the right hand line segment of that square.</p>

<p>3) Repeat above in the Y axis</p>

<p>Now you have a set containing only the outermost line segments, you can combine those that are co-linear etc and get the overall shape.</p>

"2484359","<p>I use <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DropBox</a> and I've had some trouble reaching to my files from other computers:
I not always want to login to anything when I'm in a public computer, but I like being able to reach my stuff from wherever I am.</p>

<p>So I've made a simple application that when put in the public folder, ran and given the right UID, creates (still in your public folder) an HTML of all the content in the folder (including subfolders) as a tree of links.</p>

<p>But I didn't risk loading it anywhere, since there are slightly private things in there (yes, I know that the folder's name is ""PUBLIC"").</p>

<p>So I've came up with the idea to make it a simple login page, given the right password, the rest of the page should load. brilliant!, but how?</p>

<p>If I did this by redirecting to other HTML on the same folder, I'd still put the html link in the web history and the ""url's accessed"" history of the administrator. So I should generate itin the same page.</p>

<p>I've done it:  </p>

<p><a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3045472/validate.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">alt text http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3045472/validate.png</a></p>

<p>And currently the page is a textbox and a button, and only if you type in the right password (defined in the generator) the rest of the page (<a href=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3045472/exampletree.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">with the link-tree</a>) loads. The fault is that everything (password, URL's) is easily reachable through the source code.</p>

<p>Now, assuming I <strong>only want to avoid silly people</strong> to get it all too easily, not make a bulletproof all-content-holding NSA certified website, I though about some ways to make these information a bit harder to get.</p>

<p>As you may have already figured, I use a streamwritter to write an html file (head, loop through links, bottom), then it's extremely configurable, and I can come up with a pretty messy-but-working c# code, though my javascript knowledge is not that good.</p>

<p>Public links in DropBox look like this:  </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Z3Wpz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Z3Wpz.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Summarizing: How do I hide the URL's ande the password to show them (MAINLY the password, of course) in my source-code so that no that it should require some effort on reading ?</p>

<p><strong>P.S.:</strong> It's not that personal, if someone REALLY wants it, it could never be 100% protected, and if it was that important, I wouldnt put it in the public folder, also, if the dude really wants to get it that hard, he should deserve it.<br>
<strong>P.S. 2.:</strong> ""Use the ultra-3000'tron obfuscator!!11"" is not a real answer, since my javascript is GENERATED by my c# program.<br>
<strong>P.S. 3.:</strong> I don't want other solutions as ""use a serverside application and host it somewhere to redirect and bla bla"" or ""compress the links in a .RAR file and put a password in it"" since I'm doing this ALSO to <strong>learn</strong>, and I want the thrill of it =)</p>

<p><strong>Update 1:</strong>
The one answer so far gives a perfect way (according to this question) to hide my password.<br>
Now I want a good way to hide the URL's, maby a code snippet of the example URL I gave being composed, and if it's too tricky, maby how to generate it in C#, or anything ?</p>

<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> 
I thought about maybe making three ""obfuscating methods"" and choosing them randomly in the runtime. So anyone who figures out how to read one XML, could only read about one third of them, and maybe having a hard time finding the other rest of this third..</p>

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong><br>
Just thought about REGEX, the URL could be neatly crowded by dummy not-url-allowed characters added randomly that would be removed by something like:  </p>

<pre><code>regex.replace(url, ^[^\w\d/:-\.%]+$,"""")
</code></pre>

<p>So the nosy dude should have to be pretty advanced into programming somehow, eh? could anyone tell me if it would work or not ?</p>

"2484385","<p>Imagine that HTML page is a game <strong>surface</strong> (see picture).<br>
User can have <em>n</em> number of <strong>boards</strong> (blue divs) on his page. Each board can be moved, re-sized, relabeled, created new and removed.  </p>

<p>Inside each board there are <em>m</em> number of <strong>figures</strong> (purple divs). Each of these user can move inside the board or to another board, re-size, change color and label, delete, add new.<br>
The goal of the game is not important, but let's say it is to rearrange figures in a certain way so that they disappear.  </p>

<p>But <strong>the goal</strong> of the programmer is <strong>to save</strong> the whole game surface in the database for every user of the site, and <strong>to load</strong> it later when he returns.</p>

<p>So, how do I go about data exchange between client and the database?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/atMpE.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Here's how I think it can be, but maybe there is a better way.<br>
In the database I think of creating tables users, boards and figures. </p>

<p>Then I can SELECT all that belongs to a user and create his HTML page (surface).</p>

<p>But then, user will be able to change all of those properties of boards and figures and <strong>I don't know how to track those changes and how to save them back to the database</strong>. Is this a situation where JSON should be used?</p>

Well, each figure has propertes, like this:
-board (the one it's in)
-id
-label
-width
-height
-color
-x position (relative to board)
-y position (relative to board)</p>

<p>So each of those properties will be held in a javascript variable or array while playing. Likewise, the boards also have properties:
-id
-label
-width
-height
-color
-x position (relative to page)
-y position (relative to page)
So you will hold these in javascript variables as well.</p>

<p>When you save you just need to pass all of those variables over to the server. So make your XHR with your JSON string. Once your server receives the request you translate the JSON back into variables you can stick in the database. The way you're planning your database  sounds appropriate.</p>

<p>To restore you would just SELECT the appropriate info for that user and (either with a normal page load or XHR) and use your javascript that moves everything around to create and position the objects where they need to go.</p>

<p>This is from my BlackBerry app. It consists of three separate parts, the bottom right logo, the top left watermark, and the bottom right name. It works independent of screen size because the BlackBerry app just gets all three parts and generates an appropriately sized bitmap using the screen width and height.</p>

However, I have not found any way to get the height/width of the window in Android. I can get the screen resolution, but that includes the application title bar and the notification bar, which is unacceptable.</p>

<p>I'd like to know how to get the size of my window, or screen resolution minus the title and notification bars. I think this might be possible using the dimensions of my layout managers but I cannot get the height/width of them in the onCreate method so I'm not sure what to do exactly.</p>

"2487459","<p>I run the following html snippet in IE8 and IE7 with non-English characters (we tried both Hebrew and Chinese), and the second link never works properly.<br>
The displayed text in the alert box is mangled.
This occurs in IE8 and IE7, but not in firefox. It is not dependent on Windows's regional settings.</p>

<p>Here is the html snippet (html header and footer omitted for brevity, the content-type is ""text/html; charset=utf-8"", and so is the response header):</p>

<p>I know that the string for ""שלום"" is encoded as 8 bytes in utf-8, thus there are 8 %NN items, and there are also 8 weird characters in the alert box. The problem is, how can I make IE recognize that this is utf-8 encoding text, like firefox does?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>The full html (of the minimal example) is available <a href=""http://pastie.org/pastes/879647"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.<br>
I tried <code>decodeURI</code>, <code>decodeURIComponent</code>, and <code>unescape</code>, but without success. Moving the link from <code>href</code> to <code>onclick</code> solves the issue. My problem is that some of the content is generated from other sources out of my control, and I ended up with javascript links inside the href attribute.</p>

<p>The correct blocks above the non-inline blocks are from a table with the same exact widths as the ones I'm using on the Divs. There isn't any CSS adding pixels to them, I don't think. I need to line these up, and I can't figure out where my problem is here.</p>

You could force it by adding <code>display: inline-block</code> to the <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>, but I wouldn't want to go that way.</p>

<p>Also, you should set the pink and green divs to <code>float: right</code> in order to remove the white inbetween green and blue (note however that you'll have to change the order of the divs in your code).</p>

"2499032","<p>I'm trying to use graphviz on media wiki as a documentation tool for software.</p>

<p>First, I documented some class relationships which worked well. Everything was ranked vertically as expected.</p>

<p>But, then, some of our modules are dlls, which I wanted to seperate into a box. When I added the nodes to a cluster, they got edged, but clusters seem to have a LR ranking rule. Or being added to a cluster broke the TB ranking of the nodes as the cluster now appears on the side of the graph.</p>

<p>This graph represents what I am trying to do: at the moment, cluster1 and cluster2 appear to the <em>right</em> of cluster0.</p>

<p>I want/need them to appear below.</p>

<p>One reason for the more compact than required layout is the use of the edge that goes in the reverse direction from <strong>dll1_a</strong> to <strong>B1</strong>. It tries to pull the cluster as close back to the destination node as possible. To avoid this edge affecting the graph, either relax the <strong>constraint</strong> on the upwards edges as shown, or draw the edge in the forward direction and use the <strong>dir</strong> attribute to reverse the arrow.</p>

<p>This will help with many layouts but it alone is not sufficient to fix the example given. To prevent Dot from maintaining the compact layout it prefers you can add a <strong>minlen</strong> attribute to edges that should remain (near) vertical. This may be difficult to calculate in general but is practical for manually tuned layouts.</p>

<p>I found that when the Hyperlink's parent control is disabled (IsEnabled=false), the Hyperlink will not get notified of changes, e.g. IsEnabledChanged does not get fired, even when the bound property changes value.</p>

<p>My solution was to change my Xaml to no longer disable the ancestor control (which was causing the Hyperlink's parent to be disabled). With the parent (TextBlock) always enabled, now Hyperlink updates properly always.</p>

<p>(I'm a little bothered that the IsEnabled binding behaves differently than Controls do, and I'm not sure what I would do if I couldn't leave the ancestor enabled... but at least this lets me understand the issue I was having, and lets me work around it.)</p>

<p>If you truly want to ""rewrite"" - in other words, have the page stay as <code>old.html</code> in the browser - then you don't need to do anything.</p>

<p>However to avoid duplicate content it's probably better to do a 301 redirect:</p>

<pre><code>Redirect 301 old.html http://yoursite.com/contact.html

"2501860","<p>I need help explaining to my boss why her design is poor on a client's website.  She has no knowledge of the web, and it can be difficult as a web developer working with a woman who is a graphic designer (not even a web designer really).  On a current site she has designed, an image bar ""needs"" to be ~1200px according to her, though it isn't necessary with the content.  A quick sketch to illustrate what's going on:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/8OL4v.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/8OL4v.jpg"" width=""294"" height=""200""></a></p>

<p>As you see, the banner spills out past the 960px of the content and as wide as 1200px.  This creates a horizontal scroll when all the content is viewable within the 960px wide viewport.  I need to make this an &lt;img> and not a CSS background because it's a jQuery slideshow that fades from image to image.</p>

<p>I think this is a big problem because a lot of people are going to get a horizontal scroll bar imposed in their browser when they're still able to see all the relevant content.  She thinks no one will notice and it'll be fine; I think it's very bad practice and confusing to the end user.</p>

<p>Sadly, this is not possible, either you write UTF-8 or not. I.e. as long as the characters you are writing are present in ISO Latin-1 it will look like a ISO 8859-1 file, however as soon as you output a character that is not covered by ISO 8859-1 (e.g. ä,ö, ü) these characters will be written as a multibyte character.</p>
<p>To write true ISO-8859-1 use:</p>
<pre><code>Encoding isoLatin1Encoding = Encoding.GetEncoding(&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;);

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> After balexandre's comment</p>
<p>I used the following code for testing ...</p>
<pre><code>var filePath = @&quot;c:\temp\test.txt&quot;;

sb.Append(&quot;dsfaskd jlsadfj laskjdflasjdf asdkfjalksjdf lkjdsfljas dddd jflasjdflkjasdlfkjasldfl asääääjdflkaslj d f&quot;);

TextWriter tw = new StreamWriter(filePath, false, isoLatin1Encoding);
tw.WriteLine(sb.ToString());

"2504229","<p><strong>Problem Constraints</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Size of the data set, but not the data itself, is known.</li>
<li>Data set grows by one data point at a time.</li>
<li>Trend line is graphed one data point at a time (using a spline/Bezier curve).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Graphs</strong></p>

<p>The collage below shows data sets with reasonably accurate trend lines:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Isz8d.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Isz8d.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The graphs are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Upper-left.</em> By hour, with ~24 data points.</li>
<li><em>Upper-right.</em> By day for one year, with ~365 data points.</li>
<li><em>Lower-left.</em> By week for one year, with ~52 data points.</li>
<li><em>Lower-right.</em> By month for one year, with ~12 data points.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>User Inputs</strong></p>

<p>The user can select:</p>

<ul>
<li>the type of time series (hourly, daily, monthly, quarterly, annual); and</li>
<li>the start and end dates for the time series.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the user could select a daily report for 30 days in June.</p>

<p><strong>Trend Weight</strong></p>

<p>To calculate the window size (i.e., the number of data points to average when calculating the trend line), the following expression is used:</p>

<pre><code>data points / trend weight
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>data points</code> is derived from user inputs and <code>trend weight</code> is <strong>6.4</strong>. Even though a trend weight of <strong>6.4</strong> produces good fits, it is rather arbitrary, and might not be appropriate for different user inputs.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>How should <code>trend weight</code> be calculated given the constraints of this problem?</p>
","Best fit curve for trend line","<java><math><jasper-reports><ireport><data-analysis>","2010-03-23 22:57:04","3915","2509186","3","<p>Based on the looks of the graphs I would say you have too many points for your 12 point graph (it is just a spline of the points given... which is visually pleasing, but actually does more harm than good when trying to understand the trend) and too few points for your 365 point graph.  Perhaps try doing something a little exponential like:</p>

<pre><code>(Data points)^1.2/14.1

<p>I do realize this is even more arbitrary than what you already have, but arbitrary isn't the worst thing in the world.</p>

<p>(I got 14.1 by trying to keep the 52 point graph fixed, since that one looks nice, by taking <code>(52^(1.2)/52)*6.4=14.1</code>.  You using this technique you could try other powers besides 1.2 to see what you visually get.</p>

","Good jQuery pagination plugin to use with JSON data","<jquery><plugins><pagination>","2010-03-24 05:00:05","23823","2546799","1","<p>Duplicate question, duplicate anwser...</p>

<p>You can use the jQuery Pagination plugin:</p>

<p><a href=""http://d-scribe.de/webtools/jquery-pagination/demo/demo_options.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://d-scribe.de/webtools/jquery-pagination/demo/demo_options.htm</a></p>

<p>(Download it <a href=""http://plugins.jquery.com/project/pagination"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>)</p>

<hr>

<p>Here is one way (of several different) how you can use the plugin.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Generate markup from your JSON-data like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""display""&gt;
    &lt;!-- This is the div where the visible page will be displayed --&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id=""hiddenData""&gt;
    &lt;!-- This is the div where you output your records --&gt;
    &lt;div class=""record""&gt;
        &lt;!-- create one record-div for each record you have in your JSON data --&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=""record""&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is to copy the respective record to the display div when clicking on a page-link. Therefore, the plugin offers a pageSelect-callback function. <strong>Step 2</strong> is to implement this function, for instance:</p>

<pre><code>function pageselectCallback(pageIndex, jq) {
    // Clone the record that should be displayed
    var newContent = $('#hiddenData div.record:eq('+pageIndex+')').clone();
    // Update the display container
    $('#display').empty().append(newContent);
    return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This would mean that you have one page per record. If you want to display multiple records per page, you have to modify the above function accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>The third and final step</strong> is to initialize the whole thing correctly.</p>

<pre><code>function initPagination() {
    // Hide the records... they shouldn't be displayed

"2507289","<p>I'm building a data warehouse. Each fact has it's <code>timestamp</code>. I need to create reports by day, month, quarter but by hours too. Looking at the examples I see that dates tend to be saved in dimension tables. <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/octOP.jpg"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/octOP.jpg"" alt=""alt starexample""></a><br>

<p>But I think, that it makes no sense for time. The dimension table would grow and grow. On the other hand JOIN with date dimension table is more efficient than using date/time functions in <code>SQL</code>. </p>

<p>What are your opinions/solutions ?</p>

<p>(I'm using Infobright)</p>
","Time and date dimension in data warehouse","<data-warehouse><infobright>","2010-03-24 11:44:02","51642","2517075","4","<p>My guess is that it depends on your reporting requirement.
If you need need something like </p>

<pre><code>WHERE ""Hour"" = 10
</code></pre>

<p>meaning every day between 10:00:00 and 10:59:59, then I would use the time dimension, because it is faster than</p>

<pre><code>WHERE date_part('hour', TimeStamp) = 10  
</code></pre>

<p>because the date_part() function will be evaluated for every row.
You should still keep the TimeStamp in the fact table in order to aggregate over boundaries of days, like in:</p>

<pre><code>WHERE TimeStamp between '2010-03-22 23:30' and '2010-03-23 11:15'

<p>which gets awkward when using dimension fields.</p>

<p>Usually, time dimension has a minute resolution, so 1440 rows.</p>

"2507710","<p>It's growing pains time again. Some of our stuff requires FlashBuilder 4 and some still requires FlexBuilder 3. Both are installed OK, and no projects use both IDEs. The trouble is, when I go back to work on a FlexBuilder 3 project it takes freakin' forever to build and I get weird errors like these:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/A3SBq.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/A3SBq.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>

<p>This doesn't seem to cause any identifiable problems except to throw up a modal dialog at various points in the build process, forcing user interaction. But I do notice that memory fills up fast in FB3 and generally FB3 starts behaving strangely and ultimately quits once it gets up over 700MB. </p>

<p>This is only a temporary bridge situation until we get all projects into FB4, but ""temporary"" could mean weeks if not months. Does anyone have any advice for how to get through this bridge period? Is there anything I can do to make these two IDEs work and play well together? Failing that, does anyone know what ""java.lang.String"" is the ""reason"" for the problem? Does Eclipse have a resource bundle somewhere that is getting corrupted when i go back and forth between the two?</p>

<p>The heap size used by GC is only <strong>340 MB</strong>. Where is the rest of used memory?

Eclipse has viewparts (views) and editors. It is easy to open multiple editors. Views are not so much for open multiple ones.
So my suggestion is, that you implement the part you call ""FormView"" as a StandAloneView and implement the ""ChartView"" as an editor.</p>

<p>ChartView needs to be changed to ChartEditor. See here <a href=""http://www.vogella.de/articles/RichClientPlatform/article.html#editor_editorinput"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.vogella.de/articles/RichClientPlatform/article.html#editor_editorinput</a> how that is done.<br>
ChartEditorInput hereby is a class you need to implement aside the editor class, which holds the data.</p>

<p>In your perspective you call:</p>

<pre><code>public void createInitialLayout(IPageLayout layout) {
   String editorArea = layout.getEditorArea();
   layout.setFixed(false);
   layout.setEditorAreaVisible(true);

   layout.addStandaloneView(""your.domain.and.FormView"", true,IPageLayout.RIGHT, 0.15f, editorArea);

I am trying to add JPEG support to a program with libjpeg.<br>

<p>It may not be obvious, but the background shows up with alternating red green and blue rows. If anyone has seen this behavior before and knows a probable cause, I would appreciate any input.</p>

<p>I have padded the rows to be multiples of four bytes, and it only slightly helped the issue.</p>

<p>Code: </p>

<pre><code>  rowSize = cinfo.output_width * cinfo.num_components;
  /* Windows needs bitmaps to be defined on Four Byte Boundaries */
  winRowSize = (rowSize + 3) &amp; -4;
  imgSize = (cinfo.output_height * winRowSize + 3) &amp; -4;
  while(cinfo.output_scanline &lt; cinfo.output_height){
        jpeg_read_scanlines(&amp;cinfo, &amp;row_pointer, 1);

        /* stagger read to get lines Bottom-&gt;Top (As BMP Requires) */
        location = (imgSize) - (cinfo.output_scanline * winRowSize);
        rowsRead++;

     biSize = sizeof(BITMAPINFOHEADER);

        biPallete = 32 * 256;
        biSize += biPallete;

     /* Loads rawImage into an HBITMAP */
     /* retval = CreateDIBitmap(inDC, &amp;bitInf-&gt;bmiHeader, CBM_INIT, rawImage, bitInf, DIB_RGB_COLORS); */
     retval = CreateCompatibleBitmap(inDC, cinfo.output_width, cinfo.output_height);
     errorCode = SetDIBits(inDC, retval, 0, cinfo.output_height, rawImage, bitInf, DIB_RGB_COLORS);
</code></pre>

<p>Solution: I changed the RGB/BGR converter to this:</p>

<pre><code>if(cinfo.num_components == 3){
   for(i = 0; i &lt; cinfo.output_height; i++){
      location = (i * winRowSize);
      for(j = 0; j &lt; rowSize; j += 3){
         tmp = rawImage[location+2];
         rawImage[location+2] = rawImage[location];
         rawImage[location] = tmp;
         location += 3;
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>They are a couple of JPanels, mapgrid and overlay inside a JLayeredPane, with mapgrid on the bottom. Mapgrid just draws on initialization the grid, its paint metodh is:</p>

<pre><code>public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {

    super.paintComponent(g);

for (int i = 0; i &lt; h; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j &lt; w; j++) {
            g2d.setColor(new Color(128, 128, 128, 255));
            g2d.drawRect(tileSize * j, i * tileSize, tileSize, tileSize);

        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>In the overlay JPanel is where the highlighting occurs, this is what is repainted when the mouse is moved:</p>

<pre><code>    public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {

    super.paintComponent(g);
    Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g;
    g2d.setRenderingHint(RenderingHints.KEY_ANTIALIASING,

    g2d.drawRect((pointerX/tileSize)*tileSize,(pointerY/ tileSize)*tileSize, tileSize, tileSize);

}
</code></pre>

<p>I noticed that even though the base layer (mapgrid) is NOT repainted when the mouse moves, just the transparent overlay layer, the performance is lacking. If i give the overlay JPanel a background, its way faster. If i remove the mapgrid Antialiasing, its a bit faster too.</p>

<p>I don't know why giving a background to the overlay layer (and thus, hiding the mapgrid) or disabling antialiasing in the mapgrid leads to much better performance.</p>

"2522096","<p>I have created some simple charts (of type FastLine) with MSChart and update them with live data, like below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/5WoRx.png"" alt=""MSCharts Level Chart""></p>

<p>To do so, I bind an observable collection of a custom type to the chart like so:</p>

<pre><code>                // set chart data source
            this._Chart.DataSource = value; //is of type ObservableCollection&lt;SpectrumLevels&gt;

            //define x and y value members for each series

            this._Chart.Series[1].XValueMember = ""Index"";
            this._Chart.Series[0].YValueMembers = ""Channel0Level"";
            this._Chart.Series[1].YValueMembers = ""Channel1Level"";

            // bind data to chart
            this._Chart.DataBind(); //lasts 1.5 seconds for 8000 points per series
</code></pre>

<p>At each refresh, the dataset completely changes, it is not a scrolling update!</p>

<p>With a profiler I have found that the <code>DataBind()</code> call takes about 1.5 seconds. The other calls are negligible.</p>

<p><strong>How can I make this faster?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Should I use another type than ObservableCollection? An array probably?</li>
<li>Should I use another form of data binding?</li>
<li>Is there some tweak for the MSChart that I may have missed?</li>
<li>Should I use a sparsed set of date, having one value per pixel only?</li>
<li>Have I simply reached the performance limit of MSCharts?</li>
</ul>

<p>From the type of the application to keep it ""fluent"", we should have multiple refreshes per second.</p>

<p>Thanks for any hints!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Solution as proposed by leppie:</strong></p>

<pre><code>                this._Chart.Series[0].Points.Clear();
            foreach (var item in value) //iterates over the list of custom objects
            {
                    this._Chart.Series[0].Points.Add(new DataPoint
                    {

<p>The code from the previous answer:</p>

<pre><code>$.post('/company/new', $(form).serialize(), function() {
                            dialog.dialog('destroy');

</code></pre>

<p>is going to post every field of your form in a POST request, just like usual.  If you name your form fields such that they represent properties of an object, and thus can be bound to a model object like usual, you can create your action method like normal:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult New(CompanyDetails newCompany)
{
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
       // Insert newCompany into database.
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also just use a FormCollection parameter, and use TryUpdateModel() to populate some object you create:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult New(FormCollection postedValues)
{
    // Create a new Company() here and just call TryUpdateModel() on it:
    var company = new Company();
    TryUpdateModel(company);
    if (ModelState.IsValid)
    {
        /// Insert
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If for whatever reason your form fields can't match object properties, then you can take the ""manual"" way, and just search the FormCollection parameter for the field data you need, and do your business logic to construct a new company with the posted values.</p>

<p>Once you're done creating your company, you have to remember that the action method was called via ajax, and it's a jQuery callback that's going to handle the response.  You may want to return a <code>JsonResult</code> that just indicates success or failure and simply close the dialog, or return a full view that the jQuery callback will handle as html data and display in the dialog.</p>

<p>I've got a question about using a C project with a project in the iPhone SDK. I've dragged and dropped the C project into the iPhone project in Xcode (so it appears in the screenshot below).</p>

<p>sjeng.h is a file inside GameEngine.xcodeproj, but when I try to include the header file, I not only receive an error, but the file it is looking for seems to be capitalized whereas the import statement is not.</p>

<p>Does anyone know what the problem might be?</p>

","Integrating a C project in the iPhone SDK","<iphone><c><objective-c><dependencies>","2010-03-27 04:31:12","172","2528252","2","<p>You can add files to an XCode project either by drag &amp; drop, or by the Project/Add to project... command (2 ways of accomplishing the same thing).</p>

<p>The problem appears to be that you have added the ""GameEngine.xcodeproj"" project file into your ""Test"" project, but you have not included the files (such as sjeng.h) that actually comprise the ""GameEngine"" project. That's not going to work.</p>

<p>There are two separate ways you could approach this:</p>

<p>1) add all the .c and .h files from ""GameEngine"" to ""Test"", and just compile them as part of the iPhone application directly. This is sometimes the most straightforward way, but it's not exactly best practice in terms of modularity and code reuse.</p>

<p>2) make the ""GameEngine"" project build a Framework (perhaps it's already set up to build as a framework), then add that Framework to your ""Test"" project. Obviously, you'll need to build the ""GameEngine"" Framework using the iPhone SDK with appropriate settings (simulator vs. device) to match how you're building the rest of the application. In this case you would have a 2-step build process: first open the ""GameEngine"" project and build the Framework, then open your ""Test"" project and build it.</p>

<p>Something that can be used like so:</p>

<pre><code>print_r(get_coords(12,6, 23,13, 30,9, 37,24, 24,34, 25,24, 7,30, 6,15));

"2530478","<p>I am working on a little card-swapping world-travel game that I sort of envision as a cross between Bejeweled and the 10 Days geography board games. So far the coding has been going okay, but the frame rate is pretty bad... currently I'm getting low 20's on my Core 2 Duo. This is a problem since I'm creating the game for Intel's March developer competition, which is squarely aimed at netbooks packing underpowered Atom processors.</p>

<p>Here's a <strong>screen from the game</strong>:</p>

<sub>(source: <a href=""http://www.necessarygames.com/my_games/betraveled/betraveled-fps.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">necessarygames.com</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>I am very new to Python and Pygame (this is the first thing I've used them for), and am sadly lacking in formal CS training... which is to say that I think there are probably A LOT of bad practices going on in my code, and A LOT that could be optimized. If some of you older Python hands wouldn't mind taking a look at my code and seeing if you can't find any obvious areas for optimization, I would be extremely grateful. </p>

<p>You can download the <strong>full source code</strong> here (Python 2.6 + Pygame 1.9):

<p><strong>Compiled exe</strong> here:
www.necessarygames.com/my_games/betraveled/betraveled_src0328.zip</p>

<p>One thing I am concerned about is my event manager, which I feel may have some performance wholes in it, and another thing is my rendering... I'm pretty much just blitting everything to the screen all the time (see the render routines in my game_components.py below); I recently found out that you should only update the areas of the screen that have changed, but I'm still foggy on how that accomplished exactly... could this be a huge performance issue?</p>

<p>Do you really need to do processing every tick?  If not, use <code>pygame.event.wait</code> for your event loop to only process when an event comes in, and <code>pygame.time.set_timer</code> if you need periodic events like your <code>SecondEvent</code>.</p>

<p>This means you won't be drawing many frames during seconds when events aren't coming in, but that's okay.  Using event.wait will decrease CPU usage and let you still be responsive, and likely removes the need for the time.wait you have in there instead.</p>

<p><strong>Don't re-draw the entire board from scratch every tick</strong></p>

<p>Don't have Room.render blit the background every time, which means then it has to go through and re-draw the entire board and all the cards.  Do that once.  Then don't have cards re-render themselves unless they changed darkness or they're moving.</p>

<p>When cards are moving, you should be able to restore the background by blitting just a chunk of the background graphic instead of the whole thing.</p>

<p><strong>Pass a rectangle list to <code>display.update</code></strong></p>

<p>Once you're only updating certain areas, you can pass those areas to <code>display.update</code> so it doesn't have to update the whole screen.

<p>with Mac OS X, you can drag the installer out of the .dmg onto your desktop, right-click the installer application to ""show package contents"", jump thru the folders until you see Icon.icns and then simply replace that with your own Icon.icns file.  after that, you can just repackage the installer into a new .dmg.  it's kind of a hassle, but it beats having pixelated icons.</p>

<p>this method requires you to build your native installer with an icon, however, foolishly, the included .png icon is never deleted from the bundle by the installer, even though it's only used once to create the Icon.icns file.  therefore, i suggest you only import a 16x16 .png white square with a tiny file size.  if you try deleting it the installer will say the package is corrupt, which it is since the application.xml file refers to the included icon.  removing the icon entry from the .xml will result in the installer not using your custom Icon.icns file.  </p>

<p>for those who don't know how to make an .icns file on Mac.  you can download/install XCode developer tools and use the included program called ""Icon Composer"".  it's a basic drag-and-drop .icns file creator.</p>

<p>i'm not sure how this process can be emulated on Windows or Linux, so if anyone reading knows please post an answer.</p>

<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/2fke7.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/2fke7.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>Now I am not asking answers to this question, rather than guides and pointers on this. What does a two level branch predictor means and how does it works? What does the BHR and BHT stands for?</p>
","branch prediction","<assembly><cpu-architecture><branch-prediction>","2010-03-28 23:52:16","3202","2535163","3","<p>I only <em>really got</em> branch prediction after reading Agner Fog's text on microarchitecture of modern CPU's at <a href=""http://www.agner.org/optimize/#manuals"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.agner.org/optimize/#manuals</a> , specifically, the third one: <a href=""http://www.agner.org/optimize/microarchitecture.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.agner.org/optimize/microarchitecture.pdf</a></p>

<p>If you want to be good at low-level programming, you should probably read it all. If you want to just know how the branch predictors work, just read the chapter on branch prediction in the microarchitecture manual. It uses real branch predictors from past processors to explain how the things work, starting from conceptually simple predictors such as the ones found in P1 and gradually adding more features until you get to the monsters in present-day processors.</p>

"2535156","<p>Hope someone has an easy answer on this.  I have a header image which is just a 75px high gradient with a fade on the bottom.  I have it set as the background image on my header  and I want to throw in a left-sidebar on my page.  There is a transparency on the header image and when I have my sidebar  I can't get it to sit behind the header.  You can see in this screenshot:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/QZ0xq.jpg"" alt=""sidebar""></p>

<p>The green sidebar won't ""sit"" behind the header.  I have the header z-index set to 99 and the sidebar to 1.  I tried the reverse to make sure I didn't mix up my numbers but that didn't work. Both are absolutely positioned.  I'm attaching their CSS selectors in the hopes someone has an easy answer.  Am sure I'm missing something basic:</p>

<pre><code>div.header {
 z-index: 99;
 background: transparent;
 background-image: url(images/header_bg.png);
 position: absolute;
 height: 85px;
 width: 100%;
 font-family: Helvetica, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;
}

div#leftsidebar {
 height: 400px;
 border-right-style: dashed;
 border-right-width: 1px;
 z-index: -1;
 margin-top: 75px;
 width: 200px;
 position: absolute;

}

"2535607","<p>A very simple java code inside a doGet() servlet is getting more than a second of cpu time on GAE.  I have read some quota related documentation and apparently I am not doing anything wrong. </p>

<p>The only thing that the code above tells me is that inspecting the header will use more than a second (1000ms) of cpu time, which for Google is a warning on the log panel.  That seems to be a very simple request and still is using more than a second of cpu.  </p>

         menu.timers[id] = setTimeout(function(){$(""#menu #main li#""+id).removeClass(""active"");}, 2000);
        });
</code></pre>

<p>What i am trying to acomplish is that when i hover one of the li's in the main ul the child ul of that li should be displayed. and when i move the mouse out of the li or the child ul the menu should be visible for 2 seconds.
It works through the main li button but if on the child ul and move out it just disapears, it doesnt wait for two seconds.</p>

<p>The waiting two seconds is so you can go in to the menu if you accidentaly move the mouse out of it.</p>

<p>Can anybody help me to fix this error? Maybe you have a better solution?</p>

<p>Here is also a screenshot on how the menu looks if it helps:

<p>Also in applications with LoG filtering I see that function is called with only one parameter:
sigma(σ).
I want to try LoG filtering using that formula (previous attempt was by gaussian filter and then laplacian filter with some filter-window size )
But looking at that formula I can't understand how the size of filter is connected with this formula, does it mean that the filter size is fixed? 
Can you explain how to use it?</p>
","Laplacian of gaussian filter use","<image-processing><filtering><gaussian><laplacian><laplacianofgaussian>","2010-03-30 13:01:56","28106","2546694","4","<p>As you've probably figured out by now from the other answers and links, LoG filter detects edges and lines in the image. What is still missing is an explanation of what σ is.</p>

<p>σ is the <em>scale</em> of the filter. Is a one-pixel-wide line a line or noise? Is a line 6 pixels wide a line or an object with two distinct parallel edges? Is a gradient that changes from black to white across 6 or 8 pixels an edge or just a gradient? It's something you have to decide, and the value of σ reflects your decision &mdash; the larger σ is the wider are the lines, the smoother the edges, and more noise is ignored.</p>

<p>Do not get confused between the scale of the filter (σ) and the size of the discrete approximation (usually called stencil). In Paul's <a href=""http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/log.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">link</a> σ=1.4 and the stencil size is 9. While it is usually reasonable to use stencil size of 4σ to 6σ, these two quantities are quite independent. A larger stencil provides better approximation of the filter, but in most cases you don't need a very good approximation.</p>

<p>The <strong>Totals</strong> section in the image below shows strange results for the <strong>Trend</strong> column. The text should be <strong>true</strong> when the value under the column named <em>Previous</em> equals the value under the column named <em>Current</em>.</p>

<p>What do I need to do to make <em>Print When Expression</em> and <em>Text Field Expression</em> evaluate to the same result at the same time?

<p>What I don't fully get is the application services part. What's the service, what does it look like? How do you expose a service through a module and how do you consume a service from a different module?</p>

<p>I'd really like to see some neat small code examples, nothing fancy but something to illustrate how all this comes to life (the application services part).</p>
","How do I export and import application services with say MEF?","<c#><dependency-injection><mef>","2010-03-31 19:31:52","1605","2556039","2","<p>Application Services, as far as MEF is concerned, are just another composable part.  Any interface or class you can compose can act like a service.</p>

<p>Each service will have some interface or base class you want to implement.  You can do these en masse via some type of <code>IService</code> interface (and use <code>[ImportMany]</code> to import them all), but often, you'll want different service types.</p>

<p>You'd then import this, as required, into your classes.  For example, say you have a common interface library for services, and you provide:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IDataRepostory
{
     public IList&lt;MyType&gt; MyTypes { get; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can then have a separate library export specific types:</p>

<pre><code>[Export(typeof(IDataRepository))]
public class Repository: IDataRepostory
{
    // implement interface for this specific ""service""
}
</code></pre>

<p>Your main program would then be able to import this as needed, and write code against it.  For example, say you wanted to display customers, you'd need to load the customers from your data layer.  If you wanted to load via your repository, you could import the repository into a specific portion of your application:</p>

<pre><code>public class CustomersViewModel
{
     [Import]
     public IDataRepository
     {
         get; set;
     }

     // ...
}

<p>You'd then get this service composed directly into your application.</p>

<p>This is considered an ""Application Service"" because it's an application specific implementation of some generic service - it's not a view related component, and it may be used throughout your application.</p>

"2558453","<p>I heard a rumor that when inserting binary data (files and such) into MySQL, you should use the <code>bin2hex()</code> function and send it as a HEX-coded value, rather than just use <code>mysql_real_escape_string</code> on the binary string and use that.</p>

<pre><code>// That you should do
$hex = bin2hex($raw_bin);
$sql = ""INSERT INTO `table`(`file`) VALUES (X'{$hex}')"";

// Rather than
$bin = mysql_real_escape_string($raw_bin);
$sql = ""INSERT INTO `table`(`file`) VALUES ('{$bin}')"";
</code></pre>

<p>It is supposedly for performance reasons. Something to do with how MySQL handles large strings vs. how it handles HEX-coded values</p>

<p>However, I am having a hard time confirming this. All my tests indicate the exact oposite; that the <code>bin2hex</code> method is ~85% slower and uses ~24% more memory.<br>
<em>(I am testing this on PHP 5.3, MySQL 5.1, Win7 x64 - Using a farily simple insert loop.)</em></p>

<p>For instance, this graph shows the private memory usage of the <em>mysqld</em> process while the test code was running:</p>

<p>Does anybody have any explainations or reasources that would clarify this?</p>

","Why use bin2hex when inserting binary data from PHP into MySQL?","<php><mysql><binary><insert>","2010-04-01 06:07:55","15464","2612978","4","<p>This sounds like an urban legend to me.</p>

<p><code>bin2hex()</code> maps each byte in the input to <em>two</em> bytes in the output (<code>'a'</code> -> <code>'61'</code>), so you should notice a significant memory increase of the script performing the query - it should use at least as much memory more as the byte length of the binary data to be inserted.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this implies that running <code>bin2hex()</code> on a long string takes <em>much</em> longer than running <code>mysql_real_escape string()</code>, which - as explained in <a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-real-escape-string.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">MySQL's documentation</a> - just escapes 6 characters: <code>NULL</code>, <code>\r</code>, <code>\n</code>, <code>\</code>, <code>,</code> and 'Control-Z'.</p>

<p>That was for the PHP part, now for MySQL: The server needs to do the reverse operation to store the data correctly. Reversing either of the functions takes almost as long as the original operation - the reverse function of <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code> needs to replace escaped values (<code>\\</code>) with unescaped ones (<code>\</code>), whereas the reverse of <code>bin2hex()</code> would need to replace <em>each and every byte tuple</em> with a new byte.</p>

<p>Since calling <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code> on binary data is safe (according to MySQL's and <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/function.mysql-real-escape-string.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">PHP's documentation</a> or even when just considering that the operation does not do any other conversions than the ones listed above), it would make absolutely no sense to perform such a costly operation.</p>

"2562063","<p>As referenced in my <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2119067/in-wxpython-what-is-the-standard-process-of-making-an-application-slightly-more"">previous question</a>, I am trying to make something slightly wizard-like in function.  I have settled on a single frame with a sizer added to it.  I build panels for each of the screens I would like users to see, add them to the frame's sizer, then switch between panels by <code>.Hide()</code>ing one panel, then calling a custom <code>.ShowYourself()</code> on the next panel.  Obviously, I would like the buttons to remain in the same place as the user progresses through the process.</p>

<p>I have linked together two panels in an infinite loop by their ""Back"" and ""Next"" buttons so you can see what is going on.  The first panel looks great; <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/102302/tom10"">tom10</a>'s code worked on that level, as it eschewed my initial, over-fancy attempt with borders flying every which way.  And then the second panel seems to have shrunk down to the bare minimum.  As we return to the first panel, the shrinkage has occurred here as well.  Why does it look fine on the first panel, but not after I return there?    Why is calling <code>.Fit()</code> necessary if I do not want a 10 pixel by 10 pixel wad of grey?  And if it is necessary, why does <code>.Fit()</code> give inconsistent results?</p>

<p>This infinite loop seems to characterize my experience with this: I fix the layout on a panel, only to find that switching ruins the layout for other panels.  I fix that problem, by using <code>sizer_h.Add(self.panel1, 0)</code> instead of <code>sizer_h.Add(self.panel1, 1, wx.EXPAND)</code>, and now my layouts are off again.  </p>

<p>So far, my ""solution"" is to add a <code>mastersizer.SetMinSize((475, 592))</code> to each panel's master sizer (commented out in the code below).  This is a cruddy solution because 1) I have had to find the numbers that work by trial and error (-5 pixels for the width, -28 pixels for the height). 2) I don't understand why the underlying issue still happens.</p>

<p>What's the correct, non-ugly solution?  Instead of adding all of the panels to the frame's sizer at once, should switching panels involve <code>.Detach()</code>ing that panel from the frame's sizer and then <code>.Add()</code>ing the next panel to the frame's sizer?  Is there a <code>.JustMakeThisFillThePanel()</code> method hiding somewhere I have missed in both the wxWidgets and the wxPython documents online?</p>

<p>I'm obviously missing something in my mental model of layout. Minimalist code pasted below.</p>

"2563849","<p>I wish to determine the intersection point between a ray and a box. The box is defined by its min 3D coordinate and max 3D coordinate and the ray is defined by its origin and the direction to which it points.</p>

<p>Currently, I am forming a plane for each face of the box and I'm intersecting the ray with the plane. If the ray intersects the plane, then I check whether or not the intersection point is actually on the surface of the box. If so, I check whether it is the closest intersection for this ray and I return the closest intersection.</p>

<p>The way I check whether the plane-intersection point is on the box surface itself is through a function </p>

<pre><code>bool PointOnBoxFace(R3Point point, R3Point corner1, R3Point corner2)
{
  double min_x = min(corner1.X(), corner2.X());
  double max_x = max(corner1.X(), corner2.X());
  double min_y = min(corner1.Y(), corner2.Y());
  double max_y = max(corner1.Y(), corner2.Y());
  double min_z = min(corner1.Z(), corner2.Z());
  double max_z = max(corner1.Z(), corner2.Z());
  if(point.X() &gt;= min_x &amp;&amp; point.X() &lt;= max_x &amp;&amp; 
     point.Y() &gt;= min_y &amp;&amp; point.Y() &lt;= max_y &amp;&amp;
     point.Z() &gt;= min_z &amp;&amp; point.Z() &lt;= max_z)
     return true;

  return false;
}
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>corner1</code> is one corner of the rectangle for that box face and <code>corner2</code> is the opposite corner. My implementation works most of the time but sometimes it gives me the wrong intersection. Please see image:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/OsmP0.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The image shows rays coming from the camera's eye and hitting the box surface. The other rays are the normals to the box surface. It can be seen that the one ray in particular (it's actually the normal that is seen) comes out from the ""back"" of the box, whereas the normal should be coming up from the top of the box. This seems to be strange since there are multiple other rays that hit the top of the box correctly.</p>

<p>I was wondering if the way I'm checking whether the intersection point is on the box is correct or if I should use some other algorithm.</p>

","Ray-box Intersection Theory","<algorithm><3d><intersection><raytracing>","2010-04-01 21:35:30","14081","2564250","5","<p>Increasing things by epsilon is not actually a great way to do this, as you now have a border of size epsilon at the edge of your box through which rays can pass.  So you'll get rid of this (relatively common) weird set of errors, and end up with another (rarer) set of weird errors.</p>

<p>I assume that you're already envisioning that your ray is traveling at some speed along its vector and find the time of intersection with each plane.  So, for example, if you are intersecting the plane at <code>x=x0</code>, and your ray is going in direction <code>(rx,ry,rz)</code> from <code>(0,0,0)</code>, then the time of intersection is <code>t = x0/rx</code>.  If <code>t</code> is negative, ignore it--you're going the other way.  If <code>t</code> is zero, you have to decide how to handle that special case--if you're in a plane already, do you bounce off it, or pass through it?  You may also want to handle <code>rx==0</code> as a special case (so that you can hit the edge of the box).</p>

<p>Anyway, now you have exactly the coordinates where you struck that plane: they are <code>(t*rx , t*ry , t*rz)</code>.  Now you can just read off whether <code>t*ry</code> and <code>t*rz</code> are within the rectangle they need to be in (i.e. between the min and max for the cube along those axes).  <em>You don't test the x coordinate because you already know that you hit it</em>  Again, you have to decide whether/how to handle hitting corners as a special case.  Furthermore, now you can order your collisions with the various surfaces by time and pick the first one as your collision point.</p>

<p>This allows you to compute, without resorting to arbitrary epsilon-factors, whether and where your ray intersects your cube, to the accuracy possible with floating point arithmetic.</p>

<p>So you just need three functions like the one you've already got: one for testing whether you hit within <code>yz</code> assuming you hit <code>x</code>, and the corresponding ones for <code>xz</code> and <code>xy</code> assuming that you hit <code>y</code> and <code>z</code> respectively.</p>

}

<p>(I just typed this, didn't compile it, so beware of bugs.)
(Edit: just corrected an <code>i</code> -> <code>first</code>.)</p>

<p>Anyway, the point is that you treat the three directions separately, and test to see whether the impact has occurred within the right box in (u,v) coordinates, where (u,v) are either (x,y), (x,z), or (y,z) depending on which plane you hit.</p>

"2565245","<p>I want to position all the divs to line up to the left on the same x coordinate so it looks nice.</p>

<p>Notice the picture below, how based on the number of nested categories the div (and its contents) show up at slightly different x coordinates. I need to have the div's line up at exactly the same x coordinate no matter how deeply nested.  Note, the bottom most category always has a div for the content, but that div has to be situated inside the last &lt; li >.</p>

<p>I am using an unordered list to display the menu and thought the best solution would be to grab the root category (Cat 2, and mCat1) and obtain their left offset using jquery, then simply use that value to update the positioning of the div...but I couldn't seem to get it to work just right.  I would appreciate any advice or help that you are willing to give.</p>

<p>Heres the HTML</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ul id=""nav&gt;

        &lt;li&gt;sub cat2&lt;/li&gt;

<p>Heres some jquery I tried (I have do insert the div inside this .each() loop in order to retrieve some values, but basically, this selector is grabbing the last &lt; li > in the menu tree and placing a div after it and that is the div that I want to position. the 245 value was something I was playing around with to see how I could get things to line up, and I know its out of wack, but the problem is still the same no matter what I do:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#nav li:not(:has(li))"").each(function () {
                var self = $(this);
                self.after( '&lt;div id=""' + self.attr('p_node') + '_p_cont_div"" class=""property_position"" style=""display:none;"" /&gt; ' );
        });

        //ROOT - Retrieve the position of the root element in order to place the div in the right spot
        var p = $(""#nav li:first"");
        var position = p.offset();
        var xbaseLeft = Math.round(position.left);
        $(""#nav li:not(:has(li))&gt;div"").css('left', xbaseLeft);
</code></pre>

<p>Heres the css:</p>

<pre><code>.property_position{
float:left;
position: relative;
top: 0px;
padding-top:5px;
padding-bottom:10px;
  }

","How can I position some divs inside an unordered list so they line up with the root element of the list?","<jquery><css><html-lists>","2010-04-02 06:08:56","2061","2570123","3","<p>Well, for anyone who comes along and can't seem to find an answer through plain css, I seemed to have found and answer.  I was able to accomplish this with some good 'ol math and javascript, with jqueries help of course.</p>

<p>Here's what I did:</p>

<ol>
<li>assign a ""level"" attribute to your unordered list: &lt; ul > &lt; li level=0 >, etc.</li>
<li>assign a click event to the bottom most node in the list. In my case I chose to tie this to the , which is a child to the last &lt; li ></li>
<li>Retrieve the left coordinate (.offset().left) of the topmost (root) <li></li>
<li>Assign a base left margin for the root elements (those that don't have children), which in my presentation I wanted 10px from the left, which would line the boxes up starting with the left edge exactly under the folder icon.</li>
<li>Loop through the levels for the nested &lt; li >'s and do some math to figure out how far from the BASE of the root element you were.  In my case, the css for the li's was using an indentation of 15px, so I needed to subtract by a factor of 15 for each level deep in order to get it to line up with the menu items that had no children.  For example, if you have a level 3 element I would need to subtract 10-45 = -35, thus my left edge needs to be ""-35px"" in order for it to match the root element, if its a level 1 nesting, it would be 10-15 = -5px for the left edge.</li>
<li>Add the new pixel position to the css for the chosen element; in my case I am placing this into a div that I previously assigned an id I could easily select.</li>
<li>Sit back and smile, because the dang thing finally worked.</li>
<li>Try to share your excitement with the wife and kids.....then the smile wears off when you remember they have no clue what your doing anyway....and they say...""uh, I guess that's cool dad...you got some boxes to line up...uh, am I supposed to congratulate you? When are you going to make something cool like an xBox or a Wii game!"". Dang 7 year old!</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's the code that did the trick:</p>

<pre><code>$('#nav li:not(:has(li))&gt;a').toggle(function() { //1st click
     //show div and content

var parent_offset = $(this).parents(""li:last"");
var level = $(this).parent().attr('level'); //Retrieve the level for the li of the clicked anchor
var position = parent_offset.offset(); //Obtain the left coordinate of the root li in the &lt;ul&gt; for the clicked anchor
var xBase=10, xbaseLeft;
if(level == 0) // Root node and is the base left position we want to establish, which is 10px
{
    xbaseLeft = xBase;
}
else // Subtract 15px based on how deep the nested anchor is. keep adding 15 for multiple levels deep in order to line up the box with the root boxes
{
    var xPx=0, aa=1, xPs;
    for(aa; aa&lt;=level; aa++)
    {
        xPx += 15; //Add 15 to represent the pixel indentation fromt the css for the ul and li's
        console.log(""xPx"", xPx);
    }
    xbaseLeft = (xBase-xPx) + ""px"";
}

var p_id = $(this).parent().attr('p_node');
var p_name =  p_id + '_p_cont_div';

$(""#""+p_name+"""").css(""left"", xbaseLeft);

}, function() { //2nd click
    //Hide div and content

}); //END TOGGLE

"2567830","<p>I am pretty new to the whole Java and OSGi world and I have trouble understanding the eco system of a OSGi web application.</p>

<p>To be more precise I am at the moment trying to understand how all the parts of the eco system are related to each other:</p>

<ul>
<li>OSGi Framework (e.g. Apache Felix, Equinox, Knoplerfish)</li>
<li>OSGi Runtime (e.g. Spring DM Server, Pax Runner, Apache Karaf)</li>
<li>Web Extender (e.g. Pax Web Extender, Spring Web Extender)</li>
<li>Web Container (e.g. Apache Tomcat, Jetty)</li>
</ul>

<p>To give you a visual representation of my actual understanding of their relationship check out this image:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/PrMG5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/PrMG5.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>As far as I know the OSGi Framework is a implementation of the OSGi specification. The runtime is a distribution which adds additional functionality on top of the OSGi specification like logging for instance. Since there seem to be some differences in the classpath mechanism of OSGi and web containers like Tomcat you need some kind of translator. This part is handled by the ""Web Extender"".</p>

<p>Would you please clarify this whole thing for me? Am I understanding everything correct?</p>

<p>An OSGi runtime is a server which follows the OSGi standard, it is an implementation of the standard. You mention some common ones: Knopflerfish, Eqinox. These let you run OSGi bundles.</p>

<p>A web container usually refers to an implementation of the web-specific parts of Java EE  (servlets). The servlet standard also defines an API and packaging, just like OSGi, only different. </p>

<p>You need a server to run your Java EE web apps. You package your app as a Java Web Archive (WAR), and ask your application server to start it. There are several servers, as you mention, like Tomcat, Jetty, but also bigger servers which cover larger parts of the Java EE standard, like Glassfish and JBoss.</p>

<p>A web extender tries to unify the servlet standard with OSGi. By adding some OSGi-specific data to your already packaged WAR, the WAR will be automatically parsed and started by your OSGi runtime. Your WAR servlets will be published to the OSGi http service by the web extender. With a web extender, you can run both standard OSGi applications as well as WARs using only a OSGi runtime, without the need for a Java EE-compliant server like Tomcat.</p>

"2568914","<p>I'm using a Segment to Segment closest approach method which will output the closest distance between two segments of length.   Each segment corresponds to a sphere object's origin and destination.  The speed is simply from one point, to the other. </p>

<p>Closest Approach can succeed even when there won't be a real collision. So, I'm currently using a 10-step method and calculating the distance between 2 spheres as they move along the two segments.  So, basically the length of each segment is the object's traverse in the physics step, and the radius is the objects radius.  By stepping, I can tell where they collide, and if they collide (Sort of; for the MOST part.)..</p>

<p>I get the feeling that there could be something better.  While I sort of believe that the first closest approach call is required, I think that the method immediately following it is a TAD weak.  Can anyone help me out?  I can illustrate this if needed.</p>

<p>All right, we have two spheres with radii r1 and r2, starting at locations X1 and X2, moving with velocities V1 and V2 (X's and V's are vectors).</p>

<p>The velocity of sphere 1 as seen from sphere 2 is</p>

<pre><code>V = V1-V2
</code></pre>

<p>and its direction is</p>

<pre><code>v = V/|V|
</code></pre>

<p>The distance sphere 1 must travel (in the frame of sphere 2) to closest approach is</p>

<pre><code>s = Xv
</code></pre>

<p>And if X is the initial separation, then the distance of closest approach is</p>

<pre><code>h = |X - Xv|
</code></pre>

<p>This is where graphics would help. If h > r1+r2, there will be no collision. Suppose h &lt; r1+r2. At the time of collision, the two sphere centers and the point of closest approach will form a right triangle. The distance from Sphere 1's center to the point of closest approach is</p>

<pre><code>u = sqrt((r1 + r2)^2 - h^2)
</code></pre>

<p>So the distance sphere 1 has traveled is</p>

<pre><code>s - u
</code></pre>

<p>Now just see if sphere 1 travels that far in the given interval. If so, then you know exactly when and where the spheres were (you must shift back from sphere 2's frame, but that's pretty easy). If not, there's no collision.</p>

<p>The plan is to have the buttons float in the upper-right corner of corresponding <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s in the main content area of the page. i.e. - button-1 echoed into the footer will float in the corner of content-box-1, and will be tied to the hidden <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> 'dialog-1'.</p>

<p>I'll be using jQuery and jQuery UI Dialog throughout the page(s). I'm not sure if that's particularly relevant to this question, but thought it worth mentioning just in case.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if the solution is pure CSS, pure jQuery/jQueryUI or a combination of the two.</p>

<p>Something similar to this might work.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This has some flaws, after a resize the dialog will be out of position, the reason you see the original div so close to the 'gear' is because they use position:relative on the gear and then position the dialog absolutely. </p>

<p>When an element is absolutely positioned from within an element that is already relatively or absolutely positioned it is now positioned relatively to it's parent element rather than the window element</p>

<p>I am aware of the 'limitations' of Internet Explorer (and for the sake of this experiment, I couldn't give a monkeys). I am also aware of the small 'bug' in webkit which incorrectly renders an element with a background colour, border-radius and a border (with a different color to the background-color) - it lets the background color bleed through on the curved corners.</p>

<p>My best attempt so far is fairly pathetic, but for reference here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>section#featured footer p a
{
    color: rgb(255,255,255);
    text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.6);
    text-decoration: none;
    padding: 5px 10px;
    border-radius: 15px;
    -moz-border-radius: 15px;
    -webkit-border-radius: 15px;
    border: 3px solid rgb(255,255,255);
    background: rgb(98,99,100);

    background: -moz-radial-gradient(
        50% 50%, 
        farthest-side, 
        #626364, 
        #545454
    );
    background: -webkit-gradient(
        radial, 
        50% 50%,
        1px,
        50% 50%,
        5px,
        from(rgb(98,99,100)),
        to(rgb(84,84,84))
    );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, terrible. Any hints or tips gratefully accepted and thank you very much in advance for them!</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, you want to approximate a smooth curve with a quadradatic, I'd recommend computing a quadratic polynomial with minimum square error.  I can nenver remember the formulas for this, but if you've had differential calculus, write the formula for the total square error (pointwise) and differentiate with respect to the coefficients of your quadratic.  Set the first derivatives to zero and solve for the best approximation.  Or you could look it up.</p>

<p>Finally, if you just want a smooth-looking curve to approximate a set of points, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_(mathematics)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cubic splines</a> are your best bet.  The curves won't necessarily mean anything, but you'll get a nice smooth approximation.</p>

"2589948","<p>When hosting WPF user controls within a WinForms MDI app there is a drawing issue when you have multiple forms that overlap each other that causes very distinct visual artifacts. These artifacts are mostly visible after dragging one child form over another one that also hosts WPF content or by allowing the edges of the child form to be clipped by the main MDI parent when dragging it around. After the drag and drop of the child form is completed the artifacts stay around generally but I've found that setting focus to a different application's window and then refocusing back on to my application window that it is redrawn and all is good again until the child forms are moved once again. Please see the image below which demonstrates the problem.</p>

<p><img src=""https://lh5.ggpht.com/_K6uP32RV6wo/S7wEbnnmp-I/AAAAAAAAAHg/6-FNtcP1JYM/s800/WinForms%20MDI%20hosting%20WPF%20controls.png"" alt=""Screenshot of described artifacts""></p>

<p>Those at Microsoft insist that the WinForms MDI is already a sufficient solution for MDI and doesn't need reinventing in WPF although I find it hard to believe they tried creating a WPF app this way because of the obvious shortcomings.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> A few extra notes that I left out is that if I create these Forms without setting the MdiParent they are created as regular forms and this issue doesn't happen. This issue seems unique to the WinForms MDI scenario. Also I've currently running on Windows 7 Enterprise and I'm aware the results may be quite different on Windows XP but I haven't been able to test this.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I've found a few other related resources on this issue that I thought I should share.</p>

It appears that if you call the Refresh method on the MDI parent whenver a child MDI Form is moved that the noted artifacts go away. Visually things appear a bit jittery when dragging a window but it seems much more acceptable than the example I showed in my original post.</p>

<pre><code>private void Form1_Move(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    this.ParentForm.Refresh();

    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine(string.Format(""Form Moved to: ({0},{1})"", this.Left, this.Top));
}
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried many combinations in the same vein such as refreshing just the child window that was being moved by calling methods such as <strong>Update()</strong>, <strong>Invalidate()</strong>, <strong>Refresh()</strong> and also I've tried these same methods on the MDI parent as well as <strong>Dispatcher.Invoke(DispatcherPriority.Render, ...)</strong> and <strong>InvalidateVisual()</strong> on my hosted WPF control but none of those other methods worked accept for calling <strong>Refresh()</strong> specifically on the MDI parent.</p>

<p>I realize that this probably isn't the optimal solution since I'm forcing the whole main application window to refresh every time a child window moves a few pixels but as for right now it's the only reasonable solution that I found that works. If anybody else has any alternative solutions or any improvements upon this I will gladly accept your answer instead.</p>

<pre><code>    Direction of the Data Flow
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Each binding has a Mode property, which determines 
how and when the data flows. Silverlight enables three types of bindings:

    OneTime bindings update the target with the 
source data when the binding is created.

    OneWay bindings update the target with the 
source data when the binding is created and anytime the data changes. 
This is the default mode.

    TwoWay bindings update both the target and the
source when either changes. Alternately, you can disable 
automatic source updates and update the source only at times of your choosing.

    In order for automatic target updates to occur, 
the source object must implement the INotifyPropertyChanged interface, 
as described in the next section.

"2591694","<p>I am rendering textured quads from an orthographic perspective and would like to simulate 'depth' by modifying UVs and the vertex positions of the quads four points (top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right).</p>

<p>I've found if I make the top left and bottom right corners y position be the same I don't get a linear 'skew' but rather a warped one where the texture covering the top triangle (which makes up the quad) seems to get squashed while the bottom triangles texture looks normal.</p>

<p>I can change UVs, any of the four points on the quad (but only in 2D space, it's orthographic projection anyway so 3D space won't matter much). So basically I'm trying to simulate perspective on a two dimensional quad in orthographic projection, any ideas? Is it even mathematically possible/feasible?</p>

<p>ideally what I'd like is a situation where I can set an x/y rotation as well as a virtual z 'position' (which simulates z depth) through a function and see it internally calclate the positions/uvs to create the 3D effect. It seems like this should all be mathematical where a set of 2D transforms can be applied to each corner of the quad to simulate depth, I just don't know how to make it happen. I'd guess it requires trigonometry or something, I'm trying to crunch the math but not making much progress.</p>

<p>here's what I mean:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/AVG7p.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Top left is just the card, center is the card with a y rotation of X degrees and right most is a card with an x and y rotation of different degrees. </p>
","Simulating 3D 'cards' with just orthographic rendering","<graphics><rendering><perspective><orthographic>","2010-04-07 10:42:39","935","2592032","1","<p>To compute the 2D coordinates of the corners, just choose the coordinates in 3D and apply the 3D perspective equations :</p>

<p>Original card corner (x,y,z)</p>

<p>Apply a rotation ( by matrix multiplication ) you get ( x',y',z')</p>

<p>Apply a perspective projection ( choose some camera origin, direction and field of view )
For the most simple case it's :</p>

<ul>
<li>x'' = x' / z</li>
<li>y'' = y' / z</li>
</ul>

<p>The bigger problem now is the texturing used to get the texture coordinates from pixel coordinates :</p>

<p>The correct way for you is to use an homographic transformation of the form :</p>

<ul>
<li>U(x,y) = ( ax + cy + e ) / (gx + hy + 1)</li>
<li>V(x,y) = ( bx + dy + f ) / (gx + hy + 1)</li>
</ul>

<p>Which is fact is the result of the perpective equations applied to a plane.</p>

<p>a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h are computed so that ( with U,V in [0..1] ) :</p>

<ul>
<li>U(top'',left'') = (0,0)</li>
<li>U(top'',right'') = (0,1)</li>
<li>U(bottom'',left'') = (1,0)</li>
<li>U(bottom'',right'') = (1,1)</li>
</ul>

<p>But your 2D rendering framework probably uses instead a bilinear interpolation :</p>

<ul>
<li>U( x , y ) = a + b * x + c * y + d * ( x * y )</li>
<li>V( x , y ) = e + f * x + g * y + h * ( x * y )</li>
</ul>

<p>In that case you get a bad looking result.</p>

<p>And it is even worse if the renderer splits the quad in two triangles !</p>

<p>So I see only two options :</p>

<ul>
<li>use a 3D renderer</li>
<li>compute the texturing yourself if you only need a few images and not a realtime animation.</li>

<p>This method will give you fine-grained control over both symbols size and color in a single line of code.</p>

<p>Using 'symbols' you can set the symbol size, color, and shape. Shape and size are set by passing in a vector for the size of each symbol and binding it to either 'circles', 'squares', 'rectangles', or 'stars', e.g., 'stars' = c(4, 3, 5, 1). Color is set with 'bg' and/or 'fg'.</p>

<pre><code>symbols( x, y, circles = circle_radii, inches=1/3, bg=""blue"", fg=NULL) 
</code></pre>

<p>If i understand the second part of your question, you want to be reasonably sure that the function you use to scale the symbols in your plot does so in a meaningful way. The 'symbols' function scales (for instance) the <strong>radii</strong> of circles based on values in a 'z' variable (or data.frame column, etc.) In the line below, I set the max symbol size (radius) as 1/3 inches--every symbol except for the largest has a radius some fraction smaller, scaled by the ratio of the value of that dat point over the largest value. than that one in proportion to  Is this a good choice? I don't know--it seems to me that diameter or particularly circumference might be better. In any event, that's a trivial change. In sum, 'symbols' with 'circles' passed in will scale the radii of the symbols in proportion to the 'z' coordinate--probably best suited for continuous variables. I would use color ('bg') for discrete variables/factors.</p>

<p>One way to use 'symbols' is to call your plot function and pass in type='n' which creates the plot object but suppresses drawing the symbols so that you can draw them with the 'symbols' function next.</p>

<p>I would not recommend 'cex' for this purpose. 'cex' is a scaling factor for both text size and symbols size, but which of those two plot elements it affects depends on when you pass it in--if you set it via 'par' then it acts on most of the text appearing on the plot; if you set it within the 'plot' function then it affects symbols size.</p>

<p>The puzzle consists of 7 hexagons with the numbers 1-6 on them, and all pieces must be aligned so that each number is adjacent to the same number on the next piece.</p>

<p>The puzzle has <code>~1.4G</code> non-unique possibilities: you have <code>7!</code> options to sort the pieces by order (for example, <code>center=0</code>, <code>top=1</code>, continuing in clockwise order...). After you sorted the pieces, you can rotate each piece in 6 ways (each piece is a hexagon), so you get <code>6**7</code> possible rotations for a given permutation of the 7 pieces. Totalling: <code>7!*(6**7)=~1.4G</code> possibilities. The following python code generates these possible solutions:</p>

<pre><code>def rotations(p):
    for i in range(len(p)):
        yield p[i:] + p[:i]

def permutations(l):
    if len(l)&lt;=1:

        for c in product(*(rotations(x) for x in p)):
            yield c
</code></pre>

<p>However, note that the puzzle has only <code>~0.2G</code> <strong>unique</strong> possible solutions, as you must divide  the total number of possibilities by 6 since each possible solution is equivalent to 5 other solutions (simply rotate the entire puzzle by 1/6 a turn).</p>

","Service Layer Pattern - Could we avoid the service layer on a specific case?","<design-patterns>","2010-04-08 22:00:18","7764","2604661","2","<p>""Service Layer"" is just an abstraction over your domain logic.  The abstraction can be of any degree, including transparent.</p>

<p>The term layer is misleading.  I think Martin himself would agree it is better referred to as a context boundary (from domain driven design).  Meaning that you can have many service layers that abstract your domain to different degrees.  The service ""layer"" API that you expose to your UI can do a lot more within your domain than the service layer that you expose to the integration gateway.</p>

<p>I would recommend breaking up these chunks of services along functional contours though.  (For example a set of services that are uses to bulk import data and a set of services that users interact with normally should be almost entirely separate.)  This way if you need to expose an API to another application that you expect to interact with you in the exact same way that a user can you have them use the same API that the UI does.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>
Basically I've created the code below using jQuery to scroll (move) the child DIV vertically upwards until its outside the bounding parent box where the animation then completes which triggers an event handler which resets the position of the child DIV and starts the process again.</p>

<p>This works fine, so the content scrolls up leaving a blank space and then starts from the bottom again and scrolls up.</p>

<p>The problem I have is that the requirements for this is for the content to appear as if it was continuously repeating, see below diagram to better explain this, is there a way to do this? (I don't want to use 3rd party plug ins or libraries other than jQuery):</p>

<p>That said, however, I think I understand what you're trying to accomplish, and I've written a couple of MATLAB functions that are quite successful at identifying a probable background color for a number of input images I've tried.</p>

<p>The heuristic I used is based on the observation that, generally speaking, the background color of an image is likely to be regions of low-frequency information, while the foreground is likely to be high-frequency.  (Note that when this isn't the case, my <code>getBackgroundColor</code> function will fail miserably.)  So what I do is isolate the high-frequency information in the frequency domain, transform it back to the spatial domain, ""spread-out"" the selected pixels so as to cover broad high-frequency regions, and then to simply remove these pixels.</p>

"2615528","<p>Hi all I have set the theme in the manifest file like this:</p>

<pre><code>android:theme=""@android:style/Theme.Light""

<p>But I have a problem in the Preferences Activity, in the main preferences the theme shows ok, but if I get to a sub preference, the theme gets messy, it is not white as it should, it is all dark, and the font is black so you can't see much, and when I start clicking on any items they will get sometimes white as they should but revert to black soon after. This is only happens on 2.1, in both the real device and emulator. Tested on the emulator running 1.6 and it was working correctly. Here is part of the code of the preferences xml file:</p>

<p>In a nutshell, top level preference screens seem to recognize the theme but nested ones not. So the workaround recommends creating top level PreferenceActivity for nested PreferenceScreen and then invoking this new activity via intent:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;PreferenceScreen android:key=""key1""
                      android:title=""1 Item""

                android:targetClass=""com.example.PreferenceActivity2""/&gt;
&lt;/PreferenceScreen&gt;

<p>I didn't have to apply the theme to anything but the application itself.</p>

"2615868","<p>I am learning a lot about design patterns when I am building my own system for my projects. And I want to ask you about a design question that I can't find an answer to.</p>

<p>Currently I am building a little Chat-server using sockets, with multiple Clients. Right now I have three classes:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Person-class</strong> which holds information like nick, age and a Room-object.</li>
<li><strong>Room-class</strong> which holds information like room-name, topic and a list of Persons currently in that room.</li>
<li><strong>Hotel-class</strong> which have a list of Persons and a list of Rooms on the server.</li>
</ol>

<p>I have made a diagram to illustrate it:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/od4v0.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/od4v0.png"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p>I have a list of persons on the server in the Hotel-class because it would be nice to keep track of how many there are online right now (Without having to iterate through all of the rooms). 
The persons live in the Hotel-class because I would like to be able to search for a specific Person without searching the rooms. </p>

<p>Is this bad design? Is there another way of achieve it? </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","Two objects with dependencies for each other. Is that bad?","<oop><dependencies><dependency-management>","2010-04-11 02:39:13","5420","2615900","4","<p>The mutual <em>dependency</em> problem among the classes, strictly speaking, can be solved by using interfaces (abstract classes, if your language is e.g. C++ or Python) <code>IRoom</code> and <code>IPerson</code>; in pseudocode</p>

<pre><code>interface IPerson
    IRoom getRoom()
    // etc

interface IRoom
    iter&lt;IPerson&gt; iterPerson()
    // etc
</code></pre>

<p>this makes only the <em>interfaces</em> mutually dependent on each other -- the actual <em>implementations</em> of the interfaces need only depend on the interfaces.</p>

<p>This also gives you plenty of leeway in terms of implementation, if you want avoid circular <em>reference loops</em> (which can be a bother e.g. in CPython by slowing down garbage collections) -- you could use weak references, an underlying relational database with a typical ""one to many relationship"" table, etc, etc.  And for the first simple prototype you can use what's simplest in your chosen language (probably simple, and alas necessarily circular, references [[pointers, in C++]] with a <code>Person</code> referring to a <code>Room</code> and a <code>Room</code> to a <code>list&lt;Person&gt;</code>).</p>

<p>I have been told this is the sequence in submitting a child to an already existing parent:</p>

<p><strong>Get parent -> Attach Child to parent -> submit parent.</strong></p>

<p>That is the sequence I used. The code above is extracted from an ASP.NET MVC 2 application using the repository pattern.</p>

"2618861","<p>I'm writing an an application in C# that will record audio files (*.wav) and automatically tag and name them. Wave files are RIFF files (like AVI) which can contain meta data chunks in addition to the waveform data chunks. So now I'm trying to figure out how to read and write the RIFF meta data to and from recorded wave files.</p>

<p>I'm using NAudio for recording the files, and asked on <a href=""http://naudio.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=208116"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">their forums</a> as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2543335/reading-writing-wav-riff-tags"">well on SO</a> for way to read and write RIFF tags. While I received a number of good answers, none of the solutions allowed for reading <strong>and</strong> writing RIFF chunks as easily as I would like. </p>

<p>But more importantly I have very little experience dealing with files at a byte level, and think this could be a good opportunity to learn. So now I want to try writing my own class(es) that can read in a RIFF file and allow meta data to be read, and written from the file.</p>

<p>I've used streams in C#, but always with the entire stream at once. So now I'm little lost that I have to consider a file byte by byte. Specifically how would I go about removing or inserting bytes to and from the middle of a file? I've tried reading a file through a FileStream into a byte array (byte[]) as shown in the code below.</p>

<pre><code>System.IO.FileStream waveFileStream = System.IO.File.OpenRead(@""C:\sound.wav"");
byte[] waveBytes = new byte[waveFileStream.Length];
waveFileStream.Read(waveBytes, 0, waveBytes.Length);
</code></pre>

<p>And I could see through the Visual Studio debugger that the first four byte are the RIFF header of the file.
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/s5I5m.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>But arrays are a pain to deal with when performing actions that change their size like inserting or removing values. So I was thinking I could then to the byte[] into a List like this.</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;byte&gt; list = waveBytes.ToList&lt;byte&gt;();
</code></pre>

<p>Which would make any manipulation of the file byte by byte a whole lot easier, but I'm worried I might be missing something like a class in the System.IO name-space that would make all this even easier. Am I on the right track, or is there a better way to do this? I should also mention that I'm not hugely concerned with performance, and would prefer not to deal with pointers or unsafe code blocks like <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/files/riffparser.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this guy</a>.</p>

<p>If it helps at all here is <a href=""http://www.sonicspot.com/guide/wavefiles.html#wavefileheader"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a good article</a> on the RIFF/WAV file format.</p>

<p>1) Do not read whole WAV files in memory unless the files are your own files and knowingly have small size.</p>

<p>2) There is no need to insert a data in memory. You can simply for example do about the following: Analyze source file, store offsets of chunks, and read metadata in memory; present the metadata for editing in a dialog; while saving write RIFF-WAV header, fmt chunk, transfer audio data from source file (by reading and writing blocks), add metadata; update RIFF-WAV header.</p>

<p>3) Try save metadata in the tail of file. This will results in alternating only tag will not require re-writing of whole file.</p>

        super(parentFrame,""Add an object"",true);
        // build the whole dialog
        buildNewObjectDialog(); 
        setVisible(true);
    }

    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae) {
        if(ae.getSource()==bAdd){
            name=fName.getText();
            text=fText.getText();
        }
        else {
            name=null;
            text=null;
        }
        setVisible(false);

    }

    public static String[] showCreateDialog(Frame parentFrame){
        new FObjectDialog(parentFrame);
        String[] res={name,text};
        if((name==null)||(text==null))
            res=null;
        return res;
    }
}

<p>Basically, if you give an element a background colour and apply a border radius to it, webkit lets the background colour ""bleed"" out to fill the surrounding box (making it look a bit awful)</p>

<p>To reproduce the undesirable effect, try something like the following</p>

<pre><code>section#featured footer p a
{
    color: rgb(255,255,255);
    text-shadow: 1px 1px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.6);

    -webkit-border-radius: 15px;
    background: rgb(98,99,100);

<p>You'll notice that in Safari/Chrome (the latest available public downloads as well as the latest nightlies as far as I can tell), you get a rather ugly background colour bleed. However, in Firefox, you should be able to see what I'm after. If you're in Internet Explorer, woe betide you.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a technique which will allow me to produce the 'correct' effect? Is there a CSS Property which I've missed that tells webkit to only have the background within the border-radius'd part of the containing box.</p>

<p>I could potentially use an image, but I'm really trying to avoid it. Naturally, as we're dealing with CSS3 and the landscape is continually changing, I might just have to 'lump' it and revert to an image.</p>

The issue since than happened more and more often outside of Visual Studio also - while trying to copy an .exe file from one folder to another. While in the first place Windows did not allow to copy(!) an .exe file (it was first asking me for administrative rights but refused to copy it afterwards anyway) it still showed up in the explorer. But after a while - without any further action taken, it disappeared magically. Just like the problem in the question always seems to solve itself after a while. So i assume, the problem is more related to a delayed deletion of the project output file and less a buggy VS. I apologize for any unjustified suspicion. :| </p>

<p>This gives the search for a solution a complete different direction, I guess. Did find that link and will update on any progress: </p>

<p>========================================================================</p>

<p>This is a known bug in VS. I discovered it very often - mostly in VS2010 (with/without SP1). Several ""solutions"" are recommended. Some of them, which kind of helped for me: </p>

<ol>
<li>Delete the .suo file in your project dir. Eventually need to create your whole solution from scratch. </li>
<li>Close any Windows Form Designers may remain open. </li>
<li>Use a prebuild script, which deletes the target from the output dir.</li>
<li>Disable the VS hosting process.</li>
</ol>

<p>None of these really fixes the bug. But it may brings the VS back to a usable state - until a true solution is provided by MS (if ever will).</p>

"2630492","<p>I’m in the situation that I have to design and implement a rather big system from the bottom. I’m having some (a lot actually) questions about the architecture that I would like your comments and thoughts on.</p>

<p>I don’t hope that I’ve written too much here, but I wanted to give you all an idea of what the system is.</p>

<p><em>Quick info about the applications, read if you want: I can’t share much detail about the project, but basically it’s a system where we offer our customer a service to manage their users. We have a hotline where the users call and our hotline uses an (windows) application (intranet) to manage the user’s data, etc. The customer also has a web application where they can see reports, information about their business and users, and the ability to modify their data. Modifying data is not just user data like address and so, but also information about the products/services the user has, which can be complicated.</em></p>

<p>The applications will be built on Microsoft .NET Framework 4, with a MS SQL Server 2008 database. There will be a few applications that have to access this database, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intranet application (used by us and our hotline)</li>
<li>Customer web application type 1</li>
<li>Customer web application type 2</li>
<li>Customer web application type n different applications)</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul>

<p>Now my big problem is what .NET parts I should use for such a system. For the “backend” I’ve considered using Windows Communication Foundation:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/UCPaT.png"" alt=""Possible WCF solution"">
Would WCF be a good choice?</p>

<p>The intranet application will be an application that has to edit lots of records in the database. It has to be easy to navigate using the keyboard (fast to work with). Has a feature such as “find customer, find that, lookup this, choose this and update that”. What would be the best choice to develop this application in? Would it be WPF or good old Windows Forms? I don’t need all of the fancy graphics features in WPF, like 3D, but the application has to look nice (maybe something like the new Visual Studio/Office tools).</p>

<p>And the same question goes for the web pages. They have much the same work to do, but not as many features as the intranet application, and not the same amount of data (much less).</p>

<p>That is my questions for now. I’m hoping to get a discussion going that will open my eyes to some of these technologies, helping me decide architecture to go with.</p>

<p>I would like to say thanks in advance, and let you all know that any thoughts will be much appreciated.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit 1:</strong> It seems like many agree that we should use WCF. When introducing an ORM mapper in the data layer, and a service layer using WCF, there must be a performance hit? Do you have any comments on this?</p>

<p>Another question that keeps popping up is how we handle authentication and roles. The intranet application has “master” access (no limitations). However, when a customer retrieves information from the web application about their users, what is returned depends on what their “service level” is and a few other parameters related to the customer. What is the best way to handle this? Are there any patterns/ best practices?</p>
","Choosing the right .NET architecture. WCF? WPF/Forms, ASP.NET (MVC)?","<wpf><wcf><architecture>","2010-04-13 14:48:44","7328","2640535","6","<p><strong>Desktop UI technology</strong></p>

<p>WPF is incredibly powerful and is unquestionably best choice for the type of application you describe.  If your team has no WPF experience figure on a several month learning curve, but the long-term benefits of increased productivity and maintainability make it well worth it.  The <em>only</em> reason you might consider anything but WPF is if you have a tight deadline and your team already knows some other technology very well.  Even in that case, I would consider developing the WPF version in parallel and consider the other version as just a prototype.</p>

<p>Some people are doing desktop development using Silverlight instead of WPF on the theory that they should use one technology instead of two.  I don't agree with that argument:  The two technologies are similar enough that skills and code transfer extremely well, WPF currently has many very useful features missing in Silverlight, and as Silverlight gains those features it tends to copy what is good from WPF.  So in the long run any effort spent and code created while devloping WPF applications will not be wasted.</p>

<p>Also note that WPF can run in a browser just as well as Silverlight.  When I create web applications for clients that I know will be running Windows I choose WPF over Silverlight.  I am currently in the process of converting a bunch of Windows apps into WPF web apps for easier deployment.</p>

<p><strong>Web UI technology</strong></p>

<p>You'd be a fool to use ASP.NET MVC on a web application if you could possibly use Silverlight.  Things that takes days in ASP.NET MVC take hours or minutes on Silverlight.  Things that take days in Silverlight take years in ASP.NET MVC.</p>

<p>Silverlight's market penetration is currently around 50% and growing at 2-3% per month, and it will run on 99% of desktop machines.  By next year penetration may be at 85% or higher.  You have to weigh the risk that a few users won't download Silverlight and won't access your application against the risks associated with ASP.NET MVC:  With ASP.NET MVC your application will cost a lot more to develop, take longer to get to market, have fewer features and less ""richness"".</p>

<p>That said, if there was a contract I really, really, really wanted and the client wasn't comfortable using Silverlight, I would probably fall back to ASP.NET MVC as my second choice.  But only if the web section of the application was relatively small.</p>

<p><strong>Communications technology</strong></p>

<p>WCF is a good choice for serving up your data.  It is currently better than the competition, plenty fast, and integrates well with Silverlight, XBAP, and WPF.  If you have no compelling reason to choose a different web services technology I would go with WCF.</p>

<p>As far as efficiency goes, WCF's binary formatter is just about as efficient as anything you will find, and is more efficient than typical direct database access protocols such as TDS for the usage patterns you will encounter.  If you have to use the SOAP formatter for compatibility you will lose some bandwidth in the conversion to XML but otherwise it is relatively efficient.</p>

<p>I use a data layer called ""Emerald Data Foundation"" that I built myself and plan to open-source in the next few months.  It uses the same objects on the web service and on the client and behaves identically whether or not it is connected to a back-end database.  This works very well because you hardly realize there is a communications layer at all.  Such an approach makes the data layer extremely simple.</p>

<p>Emerald Data Foundation also has a role-based access control mechanism that allows clients to be granted access to data based on relationships between data objects, so that, for example, a person can access only their own customer data.  This is enforced at the data layer so no UI layer development can accidentally expose data that shouldn't be seen or make unauthorized updates.</p>

That library became an epic failure due to an bug which revealed when <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=woodstock+firefox3"" rel=""noreferrer"">Firefox 3</a> was released. It turned out that the library generates non-standards compliant Javascript which broke in the newer and more standards-compliant browsers. It was a hard smack in Woodstock's face.</p>

<h3>Where can I find the Visual Web Pack with Visual Editor support for web page design?</h3>
<p>Starting from NetBeans 6.8, the Visual Web module is no longer available. No further development is planned.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another fact is, using visual editors with code generators is strongly discouraged in the professional development world. They were often used by starters only and it produces unmaintainable and unreuseable code to a high degree. On the other hand, it makes debugging and nailing down code-level problems <em>much</em> harder for starters, because they don't understand any line of the generated code. It also unnecessarily gave JSF in general a negative imago.</p>
<p>If you're new to coding, don't drag'n'drop code, but just write code.</p>
<p>If you like to develop JSF on Netbeans, I recommend walking through the latest tutorials at <a href=""http://netbeans.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">Netbeans.org</a> instead (using a normal code editor!).

<p>Everything clear so far, except for the <strong>hash function</strong> in the middle.</p>

<ul>
<li>How can a function generate the right index from any string? Are the indexes integers in reality too? If yes, how can the function output <code>1</code> for <code>John Smith</code>, <code>2</code> for <code>Lisa Smith</code>, etc.?</li>

","How does the hash part in hash maps work?","<hash><hashmap>","2010-04-14 12:28:31","440","2637328","5","<p>That's one of the key problems of hashmaps/dictionaries and so on. You have to choose a good hash function.  A very bad but fast hash function could be the length of the keys. You instantly see, that you will get a lot of collisions (different keys, but same hash). Another bad hash function could be the ASCII value of the first character of your key. Lot's of collisions, too.<br>
So you need a function that is a lot better than those two. You could add (xor) all ASCII values of the key characters and mix the length in for instance. In practice you often depend on the values (fields) of the object that you want to hash (same values give same hash => value type). For reference types you can mix in a memory location for instance.</p>

<p>In your example that's just simplified a lot. No real hash function would map these keys to sequential numbers.</p>

"2638586","<p>My google search skills have failed me, and I am not a database expert by any means!  I have a very simple database schema that looks like this:</p>

<p>properties_id in the CANDY table is a foreign key to id in the EXPENSIVE_PROPERTIES table.  The properties_id is only set <em>if</em> the candy is expensive.  If it is expensive, then the corresponding values in the EXPENSIVE_PROPERTIES table will get filled in.</p>

<p>When I want to get a list of the candies, I basically want to do this:</p>

<ul>
<li>request all of the properties in the CANDY table, like name and color</li>
<li>optionally get the expensive properties if the properties_id value is not null</li>

I'm using SQLite Administrator, and when I execute the CREATE VIEW statement and look in the results tab, I get unique entries.  If I just do a SELECT statement, I get duplicate rows.  If I create the view, and then do a SELECT * FROM myview; I also see duplicate rows.  Can anyone shed some light on this?  Should I create a new question?</p>

<p>HOWEVER, when I allow it to run the rest of the code after the breakpoint, it WORKS. I'm thinking that maybe IE is running the callback function before the ajax request is actually finished, so the PHP hasn't returned its results yet? Is there any way I can test that? </p>

"2646719","<p>I have built a blog application using Ruby on Rails. In the application I have posts and tags. Post has_many :tags and Tag belongs_to :post. </p>

<p>In the /views/posts/index.html view I want to display two things. First is a listing of all posts displayed 'created_at DESC' and then in the side bar I am wanting to reference my Tags table, group records, and display as a link that allows for viewing all posts with that tag. </p>

<p>UPDATE:
The issue of duplicate posts being displayed and posts w/o tags not displaying have been fixed. Just trying to figure out now, how to handle the /posts?tag_name=foobar request such that only the posts with that tag are displayed. </p>

<p>UPDATED CODE:
The posts are displaying properly, no duplication. The tag count is working correctly, and the tag groups are displaying as links and passing the tag_name into /posts?tag_name=new. I just can't get the link to trigger the display of only the posts that have those tags. FYI, the posts are identified in the tag table by post_id.</p>

<p>PostsController</p>

<pre><code> def index
    @tag_counts = Tag.count(:group =&gt; :tag_name, :order =&gt; 'updated_at DESC', :limit =&gt; 10)
    @posts = Post.all( :order =&gt; 'created_at DESC' ).paginate :page =&gt; params[:page], :per_page =&gt; 4,
              :conditions =&gt; (params[:tag_name] ?

        &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;% @tag_counts.each do |tag_name, tag_count| %&gt;

"2647570","<p>Our application allows administrators to add “User Properties” in order for them to be able to tailor the system to match their own HR systems.  For example, if your company has departments, you can define “Departments” in the Properties table and then add values that correspond to “Departments” such as “Jewelry”, “Electronics” etc…  You are then able to assign a department to users.</p>

<p>Here is the schema:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/i98Nm.png"" alt=""Schema""/><br/><sub>(source: <a href=""http://www.mindgravy.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/image.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mindgravy.net</a>)</sub><br/></p>

<p>In this schema, a User can have only one UserPropertyValue per Property, but doesn’t have to have a value for the property.</p>

<p>I am trying to build a query that will be used in SSRS 2005 and also have it use the PropertyValues as the filter for users.  My query looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT UserLogin, FirstName, LastName
FROM Users U
LEFT OUTER JOIN UserPropertyValues UPV
    ON U.ID = UPV.UserID
WHERE UPV.PropertyValueID IN (1, 5)
</code></pre>

<p>When I run this, if the user has ANY of the property values, they are returned.  What I would like to have is where this query will return users that have values BY PROPERTY.</p>

<p>So if PropertyValueID = 1 is of Department (Jewelry), and PropertyValueID = 5 is of EmploymentType (Full Time), I want to return all users that are in Department Jewelry that are EmployeeType of Full Time, can this be done?
<hr/>
Here's a full data example:</p>

<ul><li>User A has Department(Jewelry value = 1) and EmploymentType(FullTime value = 5)</li><li>User B has Department(Electronics value = 2) and EmploymentType(FullTime value = 5)</li><li>User C has Department(Jewelry value = 1) and EmployementType(PartTime value = 6)</li></ul>

<p>My query should only return User A using the above query</p>

<h3>UPDATE:</h3>

<p>I should state that this query is used as a dataset in SSRS, so the parameter passed to the query will be @PropertyIDs and it is defined as a multi-value parameter in SSRS.</p>

<p><code>WHERE UPV.PropertyValueID IN (@PropertyIDs)</code></p>

"2648838","<p>We are building a new SharePoint 2007 web site to replace our intranet website for the company I work for, and a common debate keeps coming up.  Specifically, should we be using multiple document libraries (ex. 1 for each department), or one document library with multiple folders within (ex. 1 library with 1 folder for each department).</p>

<p>I know the benefits of using one document library and using custom views to organize the documents by utilizing custom columns (like department, purpose, location, etc).</p>

<p>Also, authorization can be set at either the document library or the folder level, so that does not seem to benefit either choice.</p>

<p>It would also seem that a single document could appear in multiple views in the same document library, but the document would have to be copied to other document libraries if that strategy is used.</p>

<p>The current plan is to use one document library for all organization documents, and then put a bunch of folders within, that symbolize the organization's structure.  This would make it easy for a user to upload a document to their own organizational folder (with privileges assigned to that folder before hand).  Then, when adding the document, they would choose custom column fields to identify the document and ""tag"" it, that will enable the custom views to filter the document into multiple views (like departmental, purpose, etc).</p>

<p>I don't think views are applicable for linking multiple document libraries to show their contents.</p>

<p>Anyway, the main question is:
Is there any benefit of using multiple document libraries vs. 1 document library with multiple folders?</p>

<h3>Progress:</h3>

<p>Unfortunately <strong>it is not possible</strong> for taxonomy terms to behave in Drupal as described in my question (at least not without forcing it):</p>

<p>It is clear by taking a look at the terms_related table that it would be possible to create paths that forced related terms together using the <code>taxonomy_get_related</code> function regardless of what vocabulary the term belongs to:</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>However, the way to get to these terms is through the <code>taxonomy_get_related</code> function in the taxonomy module. This function is not used at all in drupal-6 core except to define it.  (I did find it once in the ctools module). </p>

"2656601","<p>I have a simple raytracer that only works back up to the first intersection.  The scene looks OK with two different light sources, but when both lights are in the scene, there are dark shadows where the lit area from one ends, even if in the middle of a lit area from the other light source (particularly noticeable on the green ball).

"2658717","<p>Greetings,</p>

<p>I'm working on a game project that uses a 3D variant of hexagonal tile maps. Tiles are actually cubes, not hexes, but are laid out just like hexes (because a square can be turned to a cube to extrapolate from 2D to 3D, but there is no 3D version of a hex). Rather than a verbose description, here goes an example of a 4x4x4 map:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i90.photobucket.com/albums/k250/dhiriel/hextiles.png"" alt="""" title=""Sample map""></p>

<p><em>(I have highlighted an arbitrary tile (green) and its adjacent tiles (yellow) to help describe how the whole thing is supposed to work; but the adjacency functions are <strong>not</strong> the issue, that's already solved.)</em></p>

<p>I have a struct type to represent tiles, and maps are represented as a 3D array of tiles (wrapped in a <code>Map</code> class to add some utility methods, but that's not very relevant).
Each tile is supposed to represent a <em>perfectly</em> cubic space, and they are all <em>exactly</em> the same size. Also, the offset between adjacent ""rows"" is <em>exactly</em> half the size of a tile.</p>

<p>That's enough context; my question is:<br>
<strong>Given the coordinates of two points <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, how can I generate a list of the tiles (or, rather, their coordinates) that a straight line between <code>A</code> and <code>B</code> would cross?</strong></p>

<p>That would later be used for a variety of purposes, such as determining Line-of-sight, charge path legality, and so on.</p>

<p>BTW, this may be useful: my maps use the (0,0,0) as a reference position. The 'jagging' of the map can be defined as offsetting each tile <code>((y+z) mod 2) * tileSize/2.0</code> to the right from the position it'd have on a ""sane"" cartesian system. For the non-jagged rows, that yields 0; for rows where <code>(y+z) mod 2</code> is 1, it yields 0.5 tiles.</p>

<p>I'm working on C#4 targeting the .Net Framework 4.0; but I don't really need specific code, just the algorithm to solve the weird geometric/mathematical problem. I have been trying for several days to solve this at no avail; and trying to draw the whole thing on paper to ""visualize"" it didn't help either :( .</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any answer</p>

I'll explain it in 2D 'cos that makes it easier to explain, but it will generalise to 3D easily enough.  I think any attempt to try to work this entirely in cell index space is doomed to failure (though I'll admit it's just what I think and I look forward to being proved wrong).</p>

<p>So you need to define a function to map from cartesian coordinates to cell indices.  This is straightforward, if a little tricky.  First, decide whether <code>point(0,0)</code> is the bottom left corner of <code>cell(0,0)</code> or the centre, or some other point.  Since it makes the explanations easier, I'll go with bottom-left corner.  Observe that any <code>point(x,floor(y)==0)</code> maps to <code>cell(floor(x),0)</code>.  Indeed, any <code>point(x,even(floor(y)))</code> maps to <code>cell(floor(x),floor(y))</code>.</p>

<p>Here, I invent the boolean function <code>even</code> which returns True if its argument is an even integer.  I'll use <code>odd</code> next: any point <code>point(x,odd(floor(y))</code> maps to <code>cell(floor(x-0.5),floor(y))</code>.</p>

<p>Now you have the basics of the recipe for determining lines-of-sight.</p>

<p>You will also need a function to map from <code>cell(m,n)</code> back to a point in cartesian space.  That should be straightforward once you have decided where the origin lies.</p>

<p>Now, unless I've misplaced some brackets, I think you are on your way.  You'll need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>decide where in <code>cell(0,0)</code> you position <code>point(0,0)</code>; and adjust the function accordingly;</li>
<li>decide where points along the cell boundaries fall; and</li>
<li>generalise this into 3 dimensions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on the size of the playing field you could store the cartesian coordinates of the cell boundaries in a lookup table (or other data structure), which would probably speed things up.</p>

<p>My application based on a <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366551(v=VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MSDN sample</a> so to make sure I hadn't missed something I create a separate solution, added the MSDN sample (without any changes for my needs) and unsurprisingly it works fine.</p>

<p>Now for the weird bit, when I run the MSDN sample running (as in debugging) and have my own application running, the text prints out fine without any problems. The second I run my on its own without the original MSDN sample being open it fails to work and only shows an ""M"".</p>

<p>I've looked in the debugger and don't seem to notice anything suspicious (it's a slightly dated picture, I've fixed the data type inconsistency).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i113.photobucket.com/albums/n204/Crisis01_2006/Untitled-4.jpg"" alt=""Debugger Information""></p>

<p>Can anyone provide a solution as to this? I've never encountered anything like this before.
To look at my source code it's easier to just look at the link I posted at the top of the question, there's no point in me posting it twice.</p>

<p>Thank you for any help.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>After further investigation it almost seems that my own application is somehow reading the other applications memory by accident. If I ""poll"" for the message without even sending it via the producer window, it still gets the message which must mean it's reading it from the other (MSDN) process, this would also explain why it only works properly when I run the MSDN sample first.</p>

<p>I still don't understand why this happens, how to stop it and how to fix it, this is possibly the strangest thing I've come across.</p>

<p>****Solution:****</p>

<p>Although it does not fix the problem of both applications affecting each other I have managed to fix the text problem. I did not add the necessary #include  to both files, adding this fixed it without any warnings.</p>

<p>It's always the little things.</p>

"2659544","<p>I'm trying to run an ASP.NET MVC 2 web application under IIS on Windows 7, but I get a 403.14 error. Here are the steps to reproduce:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Visual Studio 2010</li>
<li>Create a new ASP.NET MVC 2 project called MvcApplication1</li>
<li>Shift+F5 to run the app. You should see <code>http://localhost:{random_port}/</code> and the page will render correctly.</li>
<li>Click on MvcApplication1, and select ""Properties"". Go to the ""Web"" section. </li>
<li>Select ""Use Local IIS Web server"" and create a virtual directory. </li>
<li>Save.</li>
<li>Shift+F5 to run the app. You should see <code>http://localhost/MvcApplication1/</code> and an IIS error <code>HTTP Error 403.14 - Forbidden The Web server is configured to not list the contents of this directory.</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>It's clear that for whatever reason, ASP.NET routing is not working correctly. </p>

<p>Things I've already thought of and tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Verified that all IIS features are enabled in ""Turn Windows features on or off"".</li>
<li>Verified that the default website is configured to use .NET 4.0</li>
<li>Reassigned ASP.NET v4 scripmaps via <code>aspnet_regiis -i</code> in the <code>v4.0.30319</code> directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here's the most amazing part - this is on a <em>just-built</em> machine. New copy of Windows 7 x64 Ultimate, clean install of Visual Studio 2010 Premium, no other websites and no other work performed. </p>

<br>
I use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows CE 6 R3</li>
<li>Microsoft's Bluetooth stack including all profiles</li>
<li>Motorola H500 </li>
<li>The Audio Gateway service is up and running (checked through <code>services list</code> in <code>cmd</code>)</li>
<li>GSM Module is functional - I am able to set outgoing calls and to answer calls.</li>
<li>Bluetooth is functional - the A2DP profile plays music to Motorola headphones  (can't remember the model right now)</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to hold a conversation using a headset device. I have included all Bluetooth components in the catalog.  </p>

<p>I pair with the device using an application I wrote. Once the connection is made I store the device address and the GUID of the headset profile in <code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Bluetooth\AudioGateway\Device\1]</code> so the <code>AG</code> will be able to know that it has a device connected.</p>

<p>I also set <code>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Bluetooth\AudioGateway\MapAudioToPcmMode]</code> to <code>0</code> so the <code>BTD.dll</code> will know not to take ownership of SCO connections.</p>

<p>In my BT chip (Wi2Wi) it says that the PCM works with an SCO connection, but not thourgh the regular HCI stack. So I am now trying to see how to tell the BT chip to route audio for a certain SCO connection throuhg the PCM interface.</p>

<p><strong>So my questions are as follows:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I am leaning to believe I don't need the BTScoSnd and AudioGateway drivers, but am not sure. Can someone confirm this?</li>
<li>How do I send the firmware of a BT controller specific commands under Windows CE?</li>

<p>Among other things I did wrong, I set the cellular module to work with the wrong PCM interface (it has 2 of those). So now I have a headset connection that works (noisy, but works).</p>

<p>In the end, I have the AG up and running and the BTScoSnd driver running as well. I pair with the headset and the BTScoSnd driver creates the SCO link with the device. I then give the cellular module the command to divert all audio to the <em>correct</em> PCM interface and then I have both audio in and audio out in the headset. All the link handling is done by the BT controller (BluetoothCore4 CSR based chip) that is configured by default to route SCO connections to the PCM interface without going through the HCI layer.</p>

<p>The AG is needed according to the Headset and <a href=""http://www.bluetooth.com/SiteCollectionDocuments/HFP15_SPEC_V10r01.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hands-free profile specifications</a>. </p>

<p>I also needed to set the firmware to the correct configuration. To do this, I used Linux's <code>BCCMD</code> tool. Doing this through the HCI using the Windows CE driver took too long to implement.</p>

"2663115","<p>Say you have a linked list structure in Java.  It's made up of Nodes:</p>

<pre><code>class Node {
    Node next;
    // some user data
}
</code></pre>

<p>and each Node points to the next node, except for the last Node, which has null for next.  Say there is a possibility that the list can contain a loop - i.e. the final Node, instead of having a null, has a reference to one of the nodes in the list which came before it.</p>

<p>What's the best way of writing</p>

<pre><code>boolean hasLoop(Node first)

<p>which would return <code>true</code> if the given Node is the first of a list with a loop, and <code>false</code> otherwise?  How could you write so that it takes a constant amount of space and a reasonable amount of time?</p>

<p>As you probably have seen several places, you need to create a themes.xml resource:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?&gt;
&lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;style name=""MyTheme"" parent=""android:Theme""&gt;
            &lt;item name=""android:windowTitleSize""&gt;44dip&lt;/item&gt;
            &lt;item name=""android:windowTitleBackgroundStyle""&gt;@style/WindowTitleBackground&lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;/style&gt;
&lt;/resources&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note it is not often mentioned in the sites talking about custom title bars you need to select this theme at the view, activity, or application level. I do it at the application level by adding android:theme property to the application:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;application android:icon=""@drawable/icon""
               android:label=""@string/app_name""
               android:theme=""@style/MyTheme""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You also need a styles.xml to define that WindowTitleBackgroundStyle. Unlike the various versions of this file I have seen floating aroung the web, I have added one additional line to the file that sets the padding to 0 which gets rid of the padding you are complaining about:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;resources&gt;
    &lt;style name=""WindowTitleBackground""&gt;
        &lt;item name=""android:background""&gt;@android:color/transparent&lt;/item&gt;

  <blockquote>
    <p>Feature allows to export &amp; view files or some big amounts of text or XML data from tables (like files from document storage of sharepoint services). Required data should be simply output to ResultsGrid. By right-clicking the cell with required value and selecting ""Visualize As->.."" you can tell to save data to file with predefined name and open it with custom or default application. No matter than SSMS truncates long data from VARBINARY/VARCHAR fields when outputing them to ResultsGrid: SSMSBoost works with internal storage of SSMS and extracts complete cell value.

"2671966","<p>If you are running Windows with a higher DPI setting you will notice that most application icons on the desktop look terrible. Even some high profile application icons such as Google Chrome look terrible while Firefox, Skype and MS Office icons look sharp:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/3rEQi.png"" alt=""super crisp icon next to a friggin blurry one""> </p>

<p>I suspect that most icons look blurry because a lower resolution icon is scaled up rather than using a higher resolution icon.</p>

The icon is provided in <strong>16x16, 24x24, 32x32,48x48, 128x128 and 256x256 (!)</strong> (all in 32 bit including alpha channel) yet Windows seems to use the 48x48 version of the icon on the desktop and scale it up which looks terrible. (I am using Windows 7 - 64 bit - the icon is placed by means of setting up a shortcut in the msi (created via Visual Studio 2008 Setup Project) and pointing it to the .ico file that contains the multi-resolution icon)</p>

<p>I have tried removing the 128x128 icon but to no avail. Interestingly in Windows Explorer the icon looks great even when using the Extra Large Icon setting. <strong>How can I create a high quality desktop icon that looks great on higher DPI settings on Windows?</strong></p>

<p>The <em>very</em> first thing I'd do is simply survey the users.  Remember, they are the ones we are doing this for.  However horrible an application may look inside, if the users love it (or at least don't actively dislike it) then you don't want to immediately start ripping it apart.</p>

<p>I'd want to ask questions such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Does it run smoothly?</li>
<li>Is it easy to use?</li>
<li>When you use it, do you feel <em>confident</em> that it's doing what you expect?</li>
<li>Is it a BMW, a Civic, or a Pinto?</li>
</ul>

<p>The answers will be subjective.  That's okay.  At this point we're just looking for broad trends.  If an overwhelming number of users say that it crashes all the time, or that they're afraid to perform basic tasks, then you're in trouble.</p>

<p>If the app breeds <em>superstition</em>, and you hear things like ""it seems to flake out on Thursday mornings"" or ""I don't know what this button does, but it doesn't work unless I click it first"", run for the hills.</p>

<h2>2. Documentation</h2>

<p>A lack of documentation, or documentation that is hideously out of date, is a sure sign of a sick application.  No documentation means that development staff cut corners, or are so overworked with the constant death march that they just can't find the time for this kind of ""unnecessary"" work.</p>

<p>I'm not talking user manuals - a well-designed app shouldn't need them - I mean technical documentation, how the architecture looks, what the components do, environmental dependencies, configuration settings, requirements/user stories, test cases/test plans, file formats, you get the idea.  A defect tracking system is also an essential part of documentation.</p>

<p>Developers end up making (incorrect) assumptions in the absence of proper documentation.  I've spoken to several people in the industry who think that this is optional, but every system I have ever seen or worked on that had little or no documentation ended up being riddled with bugs and design flaws.</p>

<h2>3. Tests</h2>

<p>No better way to judge the health of an application than by its own tests, if they're available.  Unit tests, code coverage, integration tests, even manual tests, anything works here.  The more complete the suite of tests, the better the chance of the system being healthy.</p>

<p>Successful tests don't <em>guarantee</em> much at all, other than that the specific features being tested work the way that the people who wrote the tests expect them to.  But a lot of failing tests, or tests that haven't been updated in years, or no tests at all - those are red flags.</p>

<p>I can't point to specific tools here because every team uses different tools for testing.  Work with whatever is already in production.</p>

Most of the worst design anti-patterns - the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_ball_of_mud"" rel=""noreferrer"">Big Ball of Mud</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_dependency"" rel=""noreferrer"">Circular Dependencies</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code"" rel=""noreferrer"">Spaghetti Code</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object"" rel=""noreferrer"">God Objects</a> - will be visible almost <em>immediately</em> from just a bird's-eye view of the dependencies.</p>

<p>Next, I would run a full build, turning on the ""treat warnings as errors"" setting.  Ignoring specific warnings through compiler directives or flags is alright most of the time, but <em>literally</em> ignoring the warnings spells trouble.  Again, this won't guarantee you that everything is OK or that anything is broken, but it's a very useful heuristic in determining the level of care that went into the actual <em>coding</em> phase.</p>

<p><em>After</em> I am satisfied that the overall design/architecture is not complete garbage, <em>then</em> I would look at <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb429476(VS.80).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">FxCop</a>.  I don't take its output as gospel, but I am specifically interested in <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182125(v=VS.80).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Design Warnings</a> and <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182324(v=VS.80).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">Usage Warnings</a> (security warnings are also a red flag but very rare).</p>

<h2>5. Runtime Analysis</h2>

<p>At this point I am already satisfied that the application, at a high level, is not an enormous mound of suck.  This phase would vary quite a bit with respect to the specific application under the microscope, but some good things to do are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Log all first-chance exceptions under a normal run.  This will help to gauge the robustness of the application, to see if too many exceptions are being swallowed or if exceptions are being used as flow control.  If you see a lot of top-level <code>Exception</code> instances or <code>SystemException</code> derivatives appearing, be afraid.</p></li>
<li><p>Run it through a profiler such as <a href=""http://www.eqatec.com/tools/profiler"" rel=""noreferrer"">EQATEC</a>.  That should help you fairly easily identify any serious performance problems.  If the application uses a SQL back-end, use a SQL profiling tool to watch queries.  (Really there are separate of steps for testing the health of a database, which is a critical part of testing an application that's based on one, but I don't want to get too off-topic).</p></li>
<li><p>Watch a few users - look especially for ""rituals"", things they do for apparently no reason.  These are usually the sign of lingering bugs and ticking time bombs.  Also look to see if it generates a lot of error messages, locks up the UI for long periods while ""thinking"", and so on.  Basically, anything you'd personally hate to see as a user.</p></li>
<li><p>Stress tests.  Again, the specific tools depend on the application, but this is especially applicable to server-based apps.  See if the application can still function under heavy load.  If it starts timing out near the breaking point, that's OK; if it starts generating bizarre error message or worse, seems to corrupt data or state, that's a <em>very</em> bad sign.</p></li>
</ul>

"2684080","<p>I have discovered a strange bug with my WPF application and I am trying to determine whether it is a problem with WPF or my graphics driver so that I can report it to the appropriate company. I have a Quadro FX 1700 with the latest drivers (197.54) on a Windows XP system, running a .NET 3.5 SP1 application.</p>

<p>I have dual monitors, my primary on the left and secondary on the right. The problem occurs when I maximize then restore a child window of the main window on my primary monitor. The child window is sized correctly on the primary monitor, but it is drawn on my secondary monitor as if it were still maximized. Moving the child window around on the primary monitor moves it on the secondary one.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/5ywGg.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/5ywGg.png"" alt=""Restored child window is drawn on secondary monitor as if it were still maximized""></a>
</p>

<p>I made a sample application (code is below) which induces this behavior.</p>

<ol>
<li>Start the application and ensure the main window is on your primary monitor.</li>
<li>Double-click the main window. A green child window should appear.</li>
<li>Click the green child window to maximize.</li>
<li>Click the green child window to restore.</li>
</ol>

<p>Can anyone else reproduce this problem? On my system the green child restores, but then it's drawn on both my primary and secondary monitors, rather than just the primary monitor.</p>

<p>To work around this problem, before setting WindowState to Maximized, set Width and Height to zeros first. That will solve the problem. You may want to cache the current Top and Left so that when the window is normalized, it comes back to previous position:</p>

<p>Clearly, there's a pattern in it.  My question is, if this were an iPad app and the background image was twice the size, would there be any significant benefits to taking advantage of this pattern by tiling the image?  Or would it really make no difference in terms of performance and just be easier to load the entire image into a UIImageView?</p>

","Conditionally colour data points outside of confidence bands in R","<r><statistics><plot><linear-regression><confidence-interval>","2010-04-21 23:21:17","4103","2687554","3","<p>The easiest way is probably to calculate a vector of <code>TRUE/FALSE</code> values that indicate if a data point is inside of the confidence interval or not.  I'm going to reshuffle your example a little bit so that all of the calculations are completed before the plotting commands are executed- this provides a clean separation in the program logic that could be exploited if you were to package some of this into a function.</p>

<p>The first part is pretty much the same, except I replaced the additional call to <code>lm()</code> inside <code>predict()</code> with the <code>severity.lm</code> variable- there is no need to use additional computing resources to recalculate the linear model when we already have it stored:</p>

<pre><code>## Dataset from 
#  apsnet.org/education/advancedplantpath/topics/
#    RModules/doc1/04_Linear_regression.html

## Disease severity as a function of temperature

# Response variable, disease severity
diseasesev&lt;-c(1.9,3.1,3.3,4.8,5.3,6.1,6.4,7.6,9.8,12.4)

# Predictor variable, (Centigrade)
temperature&lt;-c(2,1,5,5,20,20,23,10,30,25)

## For convenience, the data may be formatted into a dataframe
severity &lt;- as.data.frame(cbind(diseasesev,temperature))

## Fit a linear model for the data and summarize the output from function lm()
severity.lm &lt;- lm(diseasesev~temperature,data=severity)

## Get datapoints predicted by best fit line and confidence bands
## at every 0.01 interval
xRange=data.frame(temperature=seq(min(temperature),max(temperature),0.01))
pred4plot &lt;- predict(
  severity.lm,
  xRange,
  level=0.95,
  interval=""confidence""
)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we'll calculate the confidence intervals for the origional data points and run a test to see if the points are inside the interval:</p>

<pre><code>modelConfInt &lt;- predict(
  severity.lm,
  level = 0.95,
  interval = ""confidence""
)

insideInterval &lt;- modelConfInt[,'lwr'] &lt; severity[['diseasesev']] &amp;
  severity[['diseasesev']] &lt; modelConfInt[,'upr']
</code></pre>

<p>Then we'll do the plot- first a the high-level plotting function <code>plot()</code>, as you used it in your example, but we will only plot the points inside the interval.  We will then follow up with the low-level function <code>points()</code> which will plot all the points outside the interval in a different color.  Finally, <code>matplot()</code> will be used to fill in the confidence intervals as you used it. However instead of calling <code>par(new=TRUE)</code> I prefer to pass the argument <code>add=TRUE</code> to high-level functions to make them act like low level functions.</p>

<p>Using <code>par(new=TRUE)</code> is like playing a dirty trick a plotting function- which can have unforeseen consequences.  The <code>add</code> argument is provided by many functions to cause them to add information to a plot rather than redraw it- I would recommend exploiting this argument whenever possible and fall back on <code>par()</code> manipulations as a last resort.</p>

<pre><code># Take a look at the data- those points inside the interval
plot(
  diseasesev~temperature,
  data=severity[ insideInterval,],
  xlab=""Temperature"",
  ylab=""% Disease Severity"",
  pch=16,
  pty=""s"",
  xlim=c(0,30),
  ylim=c(0,30)
)
title(main=""Graph of % Disease Severity vs Temperature"")

# Add points outside the interval, color differently
points(
  diseasesev~temperature,
  pch = 16,
  col = 'red',
  data = severity[ !insideInterval,]
)

# Add regression line and confidence intervals
matplot(
  xRange,
  pred4plot,
  lty=c(1,2,2),   #vector of line types and widths

  add = TRUE

"2689728","<p>Some background first. I have a .net client agent installed on each of the machines in the lan. They are interacting with my central server [website] also on the same lan.</p>

<p>It is important for my website to figure out which of the machines can talk to each other. For example, machines of one subnet cannot directly talk to machines of another subnet without configuring the routers and such. But machines in the same subnet should be able to talk to each other directly. </p>

<p>The problem I am facing is when the lan setup is like in Figure 1.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/x87kQ.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/x87kQ.png"" alt=""Figure 1""></a>
</p>

<p>Because Comp1, Comp2 and Comp3 are behind a router, they have got the ipaddress 192.168.1.2 till 192.168.1.4. My client agent on these machines report the same ipaddress back to the server. However, machines Comp4, Comp5 also have the same ipaddresses. </p>

<p><strong>Thus, as far as my server is concerned, there are 2 machines with the same ipaddress. Not just that, because the subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 for all machines, my server is fooled into thinking that Comp1 can directly talk to Comp5, which is not possible.</strong> </p>

<p>So, how do I solve this? What do I need to change in my client or in my server, so that I can support this scenario. These two are the only things in my control. </p>

  <p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Seems that the network diagram

  app and not tampering with the
  routers and firewalls makes
  it more difficult.</p>
  
  <p><strong>EDIT2</strong>: Using 'arp -a' you can extract

</blockquote>

<p>The client app knows the local machine address and passes it to the server app.</p>

<p>The server app knows the remote address when a connection comes in. This would be machine address or a router address.</p>

<p>From these two values you can work out what you ask.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>Server app receives connection from 10.10.10.2 with client supplying 192.168.1.2

Server app receives connection from 10.10.10.3 with client supplying 192.168.1.3

<p>The 'remote address' distinguishes the subnets.</p>

<p>So, all you need to figure out is how to extract the remote address of a client connection. If you are using any of the popular web technologies for your server app then this is very easy.</p>

<p>I can fix the issue for FF3.5.9 by adding padding-bottom (15px) but this then puts the other browsers out of action. </p>

<p>Checking deep in the documentation I found out that FF is conforming to some specification that no one else is. Right now FF is not in a great state for consistency, so you may have to break the habit of believing that FF is always right and the other browsers are wrong. You may want to keep your finger on the Mozilla blogs and see what they are saying so you have fewer surprises.</p>

"2690937","<p>I have come across a problem I just can't solve. I am using <a href=""https://jquery.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">autocomplete</a> plugin for jQuery on an input. The HTML looks something like this:</p>

<p>I am sure that this is the only <code>id=""house""</code> field. Other fields that are before this one work fine with autocomplete, and it's basically the same algorithm (other variables, other data, other calls). So why doesn't it work like it should work with the following init. code:</p>

<p>I've done something similar to this recently with jQueryUI autocomplete. You mention in your comments that you've tried this with no luck, but I assume you're interested in a solution using either library. Here's how I would do it:</p>

<pre><code>$(""house"").autocomplete({

        //input will auto-populate with ""value"" part
        $(""#row_house .button-finish"").click(function() {  
            QueryServer(""HouseConnect"",""FillData"",true,ui.item.id);                           
        });
    },
    //this next function is a hack to replicate the ""mustMatch"" functionality of the bassistance autocomplete plugin
    change: function (event, ui) {
        var source = $(this).val();
        var found = $('.ui-autocomplete li').text().search(source);
        if(found &lt; 0) { //no match!

           $(""#row_house .button-finish"").unbind(""click"");
        }            
    }

<p>I tried Float, double and even long double datatypes but still same problem. </p>

<p>Hence, say in a 100K words document I am analyzing, if just 162 words are having 1% spam probability and remaining 99838 are conspicuously spam words, then still my app will say it as Not Spam doc because of Precision error (as numerator easily goes to ZERO)!!!.</p>

<p>This is the first time I am hitting such issue. So how exactly should this problem be tackled?</p>
","Problem with Precision floating point operation in C","<c><floating-point><machine-learning><spam-prevention>","2010-04-22 13:09:55","1187","2697234","6","<p>Your problem is caused because you are collecting too many terms without regard for their size. One solution is to take logarithms. Another is to sort your individual terms. First, let's rewrite the equation as <code>1/p = 1 + ∏((1-p_i)/p_i)</code>. Now your problem is that some of the terms are small, while others are big. If you have too many small terms in a row, you'll underflow, and with too many big terms you'll overflow the intermediate result. </p>

<p>So, don't put too many of the same order in a row. Sort the terms <code>(1-p_i)/p_i</code>. As a result, the first will be the smallest term, the last the biggest. Now, if you'd multiply them straight away you would still have an underflow. But the order of calculation doesn't matter. Use two iterators into your temporary collection. One starts at the beginning (i.e. <code>(1-p_0)/p_0</code>), the other at the end (i.e <code>(1-p_n)/p_n</code>), and your intermediate result starts at <code>1.0</code>. Now, when your intermediate result is >=1.0, you take a term from the front, and when your intemediate result is &lt; 1.0 you take a result from the back. </p>

<p>The result is that as you take terms, the intermediate result will oscillate around 1.0. It will only go up or down as you run out of small or big terms. But that's OK. At that point, you've consumed the extremes on both ends, so it the intermediate result will slowly approach the final result. </p>

<p>There's of course a real possibility of overflow. If the input is completely unlikely to be spam (p=1E-1000) then <code>1/p</code> will overflow, because <code>∏((1-p_i)/p_i)</code> overflows. But since the terms are sorted, we know that the intermediate result will overflow <strong>only</strong> if <code>∏((1-p_i)/p_i)</code> overflows. So, if the intermediate result overflows, there's no subsequent loss of precision.</p>

"2694236","<p>I am having an issue when a page contains multiple ModalPopups each containing a ValidationSummary Control.</p>

<p>Here is the functionality I need:</p>

<ol>
<li>A user clicks a button and a Modal Popup appears with dynamic content based on the button that was clicked.  (This functionality is working.  Buttons are wrapped in UpdatePanels and the partial page postback calls .Show() on the ModalPopup)</li>
<li>""Save"" button in ModalPopup causes client side validation, then causes a full page postback so the entire ModalPopup disappears. (ModalPopup could disappear another way - the ModalPopup just needs to disappear after a successful save operation)</li>
<li>If errors occur in the codebehind during Save operation, messages are added to the ValidationSummary (contained within the ModalPopup) and the ModalPopup is displayed again.</li>
</ol>

<p>When the ValidationSummary's are added to the PopupPanel's, the ModalPopups no longer display correctly after a full page postback caused by the ""Save"" button within the second PopupPanel. (the first panel continues to function correctly)  Both PopupPanels are displayed, and neither is ""Popped-Up"", they are displayed in-line.</p>

<p>Any ideas on how to solve this?</p>

<p>EDIT: Functionality in each Popup is different - that is why there must be two different ModalPopups.</p>

<p>function () {
  Array.remove(Page_ValidationSummaries, document.getElementById(VALIDATION_SUMMARY_ID));

<p><img src=""https://i1004.photobucket.com/albums/af165/sommardahl/Picture1.png"" alt=""My current payment types with properties"" title=""My current payment types with properties""></p>

<p>Keeping it simple, I have three payment types: credit card, e-check, or ""bill me later"". I want to:</p>

<ol>
<li>choose one payment type</li>
<li>display some fields for one payment type in my view</li>
<li>run some logic using those fields (specific to the type)</li>
<li>display a confirmation view</li>
<li>run some more logic using those fields (specific to the type)</li>
<li>display a receipt view</li>
</ol>

<p>Each payment type has fields specific to the type... maybe 2 fields, maybe more. For now, I know how many and what fields, but more could be added. I believe the best thing for my views is to have a partial view per payment type to handle the different fields and let the controller decide which partial to render (if you have a better option, I'm open). My real problem comes from the logic that happens in the controller between views. Each payment type has a variable number of fields. I'd like to keep everything strongly typed, but it feels like some sort of dictionary is the only option. Add to that specific logic that runs depending on the payment type. </p>

<p>In an effort to keep things strongly typed, I've created a class for each payment type. No interface or inherited type since the fields are different per payment type. Then, I've got a Submit() method for each payment type. Then, while the controller is deciding which partial view to display, it also assigns the target of the submit action. </p>

<p>This is not elegant solution and feels very wrong. I'm reaching out for a hand. How would you do this?</p>
","How to handle payment types with varying properties in the most elegant way","<c#><asp.net-mvc><design-patterns>","2010-04-23 00:11:52","311","2695452","2","<p>It's one for thing for, say, an <code>Order</code> object to not really care about the particular payment type--just knowing that there is a <code>PledgedAmount</code> and a <code>DepositedAmount</code> property, for example, is enough for that class to do its job (e.g., ""don't allow myself to go to Shipped status if order is not charged, via whatever payment method, I don't really care, as long as it's charged somehow I'm cool"").</p>

<p>It's another thing for the UI to not really care: you either write a <code>switch</code> to load the right view and be done with it, or you end up creating a dictionary-like collection of fields, rules, and validation metadata and let the UI generate itself dynamically.</p>

<p>For example, I took the latter approach when I was adding international address support for one of my applications. I abstracted addresses into a common set of fields: <code>AdministrativeArea</code>, <code>Municipality</code>, etc, and defined an <code>AddressScheme</code> class which defined <code>AddressFieldRule</code>s for each field, stating whether or not it was required, if a regex should be applied, if there is a specific set of allowed values, etc. It was appropriate since we could add or remove countries to the allowed list at any time without recompiling and redeploying the application; the UI could dynamically generate itself based on the <code>AddressScheme</code>, which itself was loaded from the database. Sweet.</p>

<p>But are you really going to be adding payment types (a) with great frequency or (b) without re-compiling your application? Sometimes you really do need an actual Toaster instead of a Breakfast Cooking Machine w/ Bread and Other Yeast-Based Goods Browning Module, so just add a switch or a dictionary that maps a type to the correct view: I think it's perfectly acceptable for the UI to have to be able to distinguish among these types, and, more importantly, for you to custom-write and tailor the presentation of each type--but the higher-up parts might benefit from some abstraction. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/312006/what-database-schema-can-i-use-to-save-different-types-of-billing-data/312144#312144"">I talked about that in my answer to a different question related to billing.</a></p>

<p>In your example, you can share common code for steps 1, 4, and 6, but delegate to specific UI methods and views for steps 2, 3, and 5. And the world will still spin round.</p>

<p>My two cents. Good luck!</p>

<p>The IIS6, ""IISVDir"" commands reference paths in that are from the metabase, eg, <code>/W3SVC/1/ROOT/MyApp</code> - where 1 is ID of ""Default Web Site"". The command doesn't actually require the display name of the site to make changes to it.</p>

<p>This works well, since on a different language OS, the ""Default Web Site"" site name could be named, for example, ""既定の Web サイト"" or anything else for that matter. But this flexibility is lost if AppCmd can only reference ""Default Web Site"" via its name, and not a language-neutral identifier.</p>

<p>So, how can I script AppCmd to refer to sites, vdirs and apps using language neutral identifiers to reference the ""Default App Site""?</p>

<p>Perhaps I need to start creating my own site instead, from the start, and name it something else specific, and stop using ""Default Web Site"" as the root?</p>

  var site = serverManager.Sites

<h2>Goals:</h2>

<p>I am attempting to create a custom designer class for Workflow activities to achieve the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Make activities look less technical.</strong> For example, I don't necessarily want to see the internal object name as the activity's ""title"" -- instead, I'd like to see something more descriptive.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Display the values of certain properties beneath the title text.</strong> I would like to see some properties' values directly underneath the title so that I don't need to look somewhere else (namely, at the Properties window).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide custom drop areas and draw custom internal arrows.</strong> As an example, I would like to be able to have custom drop areas in very specific places.</p></li>
</ol>

<hr>

<h2>What I found out so far:</h2>

<p>I created a custom designer class deriving from <code>SequentialActivityDesigner</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>[Designer(typeof(SomeDesigner))]
public partial class SomeActivity: CompositeActivity
{
    ...
}

class PlainDesigner : SequentialActivityDesigner
{
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Through overriding some properties and the <code>OnPaint</code> method, I found out about the following correspondences between the properties and how the activity will be displayed:</p>

"2708132","<p>As the question says, for some reason my program is not flushing the input or using my variables in ways that I cannot identify at the moment. This is for a homework project that I've gone beyond what I had to do for it, now I just want the program to actually work :P</p>

<p>Details to make the finding easier:</p>

<p>The program executes flawlessly on the first run through. All throws work, only the proper values( n > 0 ) are accepted and turned into binary. </p>

<p>As soon as I enter my terminate input, the program goes into a loop and only asks for the terminate again like so:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i16.photobucket.com/albums/b9/SoulBeaver/Output.jpg""></p>

<p>When I run this program on Netbeans on my Linux Laptop, the program crashes after I input the terminate value. On Visual C++ on Windows it goes into the loop like just described. </p>

<p>In the code I have tried to clear every stream and initialze every variable new as the program restarts, but to no avail. I just can't see my mistake. </p>

<p>I believe the error to lie in either the main function:</p>

<pre><code>int main( void )
{
vector&lt;int&gt; store;
int terminate = 1;

do
{
    int    num   =  0;
    string input = """";

        cin.clear();
        cin.ignore( numeric_limits&lt;streamsize&gt;::max(), '\n' );
    }

    cout &lt;&lt; ""Please enter a natural number."" &lt;&lt; endl;
    readLine( input, num );

    cout &lt;&lt; ""\nThank you. Number is being processed..."" &lt;&lt; endl;

    cout &lt;&lt; ""Go again? 0 to terminate."" &lt;&lt; endl;
    cin &gt;&gt; terminate // No checking yet, just want it to work!

    cin.clear();
}while( terminate );

cin.get();
return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>or in the function that reads the number:</p>

<pre><code>void readLine( string &amp;input, int &amp;num )
{
    int buf = 1;
    stringstream ss;
    vec_sz size;

    if( ss.fail() )
 {
        ss.clear();
     ss.ignore( numeric_limits&lt;streamsize&gt;::max(), '\n' );
 }

    if( getline( cin, input ) )
    {
       size = input.size();
       for( int loop = 0; loop &lt; size; ++loop )
           if( isalpha( input[loop] ) )
               throw domain_error( ""Invalid Input."" );

    ss &lt;&lt; input;

"2708476","<p>NB: I'll present this question in degrees purely for simplicity, radians, degrees, different zero-bearing, the problem is essentially the same.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas on the code behind rotational interpolation? Given a linear interpolation function: Lerp(from, to, amount), where amount is 0...1 which returns a value between from and to, by amount. How could I apply this same function to a rotational interpolation between 0 and 360 degrees? Given that degrees should not be returned outside 0 and 360.</p>

<p>Given this unit circle for degrees:</p>

<p>where from = 45 and to = 315, the algorithm should take the shortest path to the angle, i.e. it should go through zero, to 360 and then to 315 - and not all the way round 90, 180, 270 to 315.</p>

<p>Is there a nice way to achieve this? Or is it going to just be a horrid mess of if() blocks? Am I missing some well understood standard way of doing this?

<p><strong>Edit 4</strong> Thanks everyone for the help, I managed to get it working. Oleg's answer gave me the information I needed to find out what I was doing wrong. </p>

<p><strong>There are 2 ways to do this.</strong> One is to build with the gcc -mno-cygwin compiler flag, which builds the dll without the cygwin dll, basically as if you had built it in MingW. Building it this way got my hello world example working! However, MingW doesn't have all the libraries that cygwin has in the installer, so if your POSIX code has dependencies on these libraries (mine had heaps) you can't do this way. And if your POSIX code didn't have those dependencies, why not just build for Win32 from the beginning. So that's not much help unless you want to spend time setting up MingW properly.</p>

<p>The other option is to build with the Cygwin DLL. The Cygwin DLL needs an initialization function init() to be called before it can be used. This is why my code wasn't working before. The code below loads and runs my hello world example.</p>

<pre><code>    //[DllImport(@""hello.dll"", EntryPoint = ""#1"",SetLastError = true)]
    //static extern int helloworld(); //don't do this! cygwin needs to be init first

    [DllImport(""kernel32"", CharSet = CharSet.Ansi, ExactSpelling = true, SetLastError = true)]
    static extern IntPtr GetProcAddress(IntPtr hModule, string procName);

    [DllImport(""kernel32"", SetLastError = true)]
    static extern IntPtr LoadLibrary(string lpFileName);


    public delegate int MyFunction();

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        //load cygwin dll
        IntPtr pcygwin = LoadLibrary(""cygwin1.dll"");
        IntPtr pcyginit = GetProcAddress(pcygwin, ""cygwin_dll_init"");
        Action init = (Action)Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(pcyginit, typeof(Action));
        init(); 

        IntPtr phello = LoadLibrary(""hello.dll"");
        IntPtr pfn = GetProcAddress(phello, ""helloworld"");
        MyFunction helloworld = (MyFunction)Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer(pfn, typeof(MyFunction));

        Console.WriteLine(helloworld());
        Console.ReadKey();
    }

Before you can use your <strong>helloworld.dll</strong> a cygwin environment must be initialized (see <a href=""http://cygwin.com/faq/faq.programming.html#faq.programming.msvs-mingw"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://cygwin.com/faq/faq.programming.html#faq.programming.msvs-mingw</a>). So the following code in native C++ will works:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

typedef int (*PFN_HELLO)();
typedef void (*PFN_CYGWIN_DLL_INIT)();

int main()
{
    PFN_HELLO fnHello;
    HMODULE hLib, h = LoadLibrary(TEXT(""cygwin1.dll"")); 
    PFN_CYGWIN_DLL_INIT init = (PFN_CYGWIN_DLL_INIT) GetProcAddress(h,""cygwin_dll_init"");
    init(); 

    hLib = LoadLibrary (TEXT(""C:\\cygwin\\home\\Oleg\\mydll.dll""));
    fnHello = (PFN_HELLO) GetProcAddress (hLib, ""hello"");
    return fnHello();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of cause the path to <strong>cygwin1.dll</strong> must be found. You can set C:\cygwin\bin as a current directory, use <code>SetDllDirectory</code> function or easy include C:\cygwin\bin in the global PATH environment variable (click on right mouse button on Computer, choose Properties then ""Advanced System Settings"", ""Environment variables..."", then choose system variable PATH and append it with "";C:\cygwin\bin"").</p>

<p>Next if you compile you DLL, you should better to use DEF-file to define BASE address of DLL during compiling and makes all function names, which you exported more clear readable (see <a href=""http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-4-Manual/gnu-linker/win32.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/enterprise/RHEL-4-Manual/gnu-linker/win32.html</a>)</p>

<p>You can verify results with <code>dumpbin.exe mydll.dll /exports</code>, if you have Visual Studio installed. (don't forget start command promt from ""Visual Studio Command Prompt (2010)"" to have all Visual Studio set).</p>

<p><strong>UPDATED</strong>: Because you don't write about the success I think there are exist some problems. In Win32/Win64 world (unmanaged world) it works. The code which I posted I have tested. Loading of CygWin DLLs in .NET can have some problem. In <a href=""http://cygwin.com/faq/faq.programming.html#faq.programming.msvs-mingw"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://cygwin.com/faq/faq.programming.html#faq.programming.msvs-mingw</a> one can read ""<strong>Make sure you have 4K of scratch space at the bottom of your stack</strong>"". This requirement can be wrong in .NET. A stack is a part of thread and not a process. So you can try to use CygWin DLLs in the new .NET Thread. Since .NET 2.0 one can define the maximum stack size for the thread. One other way is trying to understand <a href=""http://cygwin.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/src/winsup/cygwin/how-cygtls-works.txt?rev=1.1&amp;content-type=text/plain&amp;cvsroot=src"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://cygwin.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/src/winsup/cygwin/how-cygtls-works.txt?rev=1.1&amp;content-type=text/plain&amp;cvsroot=src</a> and the code described in <a href=""http://old.nabble.com/Cygwin-dll-from-C--Application-td18616035.html#a18616996"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://old.nabble.com/Cygwin-dll-from-C--Application-td18616035.html#a18616996</a>. But the really interesting I find two ways without any tricks:</p>

<ol>
<li>Compiling the DLL with respect of MinGW tools instead of CygWin tools. MinGW produce code which are much more Windows compatible. I am not using CygWin or MinGW myself, so I am not sure, that you will be able to compile all you existing code used POSIX function in MinGW. If it is do possible, this way can have more success. You can look at <a href=""http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/csharp/call_dll.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/csharp/call_dll.html</a> for example, to see, that MinGW DLL can be called from C# exactly like a Windows DLL.</li>

"2710751","<p>I'm trying to use the OleDb CSV parser to load some data from a CSV file and insert it into a SQLite database, but I get an exception with the <code>OleDbAdapter.Fill</code> method and it's frustrating:</p>

I changed the HDR property from <code>HDR=No</code> to <code>HDR=Yes</code> and now it doesn't give me an exception:</p>

<p>Use a transaction and let the target db throw if it wants.</p>

<p>First of all, should I have all my coordinates in an array which I then compare my onclick coordinate to?</p>

<p>Or seeing as my grid coordinates follow a rule, could I do something like finding out which coordinate that is a multiple of <em>whatever my spacing is</em> is closest to the onclick coordinate?</p>

I like that way of doing it, but his version has got some floors (though it's still a very good answer).</p>

<p>I presume that what you want is a HTML-less grid (that is, without markup like a table), which bobince supplies a solution for. In that case, the code may be optimised significantly for cross browser compatibility, readability, errors and speed.</p>

<p>So, I suggest the code should be more like this:</p>

<pre><code>#canvas { position: relative; width: 100px; height: 100px; border: solid red 1px; }
#nearest { position: absolute; width: 10px; height: 10px; background: yellow; }

&lt;div id=""canvas""&gt;&lt;div id=""nearest""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

var
    canvasOffset = $(""div#canvas"").offset(),
    // Assuming that the space between the points is 10 pixels. Correct this if necessary.
    cellSpacing = 10;

$(""div#canvas"").mousemove(function(event) {
    event = event || window.event;
    $(""div#nearest"").css({
        top: Math.round((mouseCoordinate(event, ""X"") - canvasOffset.left) / cellSpacing) * cellSpacing + ""px"",
        left: Math.round((mouseCoordinate(event, ""Y"") - canvasOffset.top) / cellSpacing) * cellSpacing + ""px""
    });
});

// Returns the one half of the current mouse coordinates relative to the browser window.
// Assumes the axis parameter to be uppercase: Either ""X"" or ""Y"".
function mouseCoordinate(event, axis) {
    var property = (axis == ""X"") ? ""scrollLeft"" : ""scrollTop"";
    if (event.pageX) {
        return event[""page""+axis];
    } else {
        return event[""client""+axis] + (document.documentElement[property] ? document.documentElement[property] : document.body[property]);;
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>The mouseCoordinate() function is a boiled down version of these two functions:</p>

<pre><code>function mouseAxisX(event) {
    if (event.pageX) {
        return event.pageX;
    } else if (event.clientX) {
        return event.clientX + (document.documentElement.scrollLeft ? document.documentElement.scrollLeft : document.body.scrollLeft);
    }
};

function mouseAxisY(event) {
    if (event.pageY) {
        return event.pageY;
    } else if (event.clientY) {
        return event.clientY + (document.documentElement.scrollTop ? document.documentElement.scrollTop : document.body.scrollTop);
    }
};

<p>Make a bigger button.</p>

<p>As an experiment, remove <code>android:src</code> from your layout, then run your app. That is the <em>smallest</em> an <code>ImageButton</code> can go without a custom background.</p>

<p>You are welcome to create your own custom <code>ImageButton</code> background with custom nine-patch PNG files for the different background states, where you adjust the nine-patch control frame to allow for a smaller gap between where your icon goes and the edges of the button.</p>

<p>Update 1:</p>

<p>I see I have received a few questions that look a bit complicated to me, although I definitely remember I was able to do it, and it was very simple, except i don't remember what exactly i changed then in this code. </p>

<p>Perhaps, I didn't give You all enough details on how I run this code and where I found it. So, let me tell You what I did. I only installed Python 2.5 on my computer and then downloaded ""Google App Engine SDK"" and installed it, too. Following the instructions on ""GAE"" page (<a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20120303184301/http://code.google.com:80/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/helloworld.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/helloworld.html</a>) I created a directory and named it “My_test”, then I created a “my_test.py” in it containing that small piece of the code that I mentioned in my question. </p>

<p>Then, continuing to follow on the said instructions, I created an “app.yaml” file in it, in which my “my_test.py” file was mentioned. After that in “Google App Engine Launcher” I found “My_test” directory and clicked on Run button, and then on Browse. Then, having visited this URL <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20170831232747/http://localhost:8080/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://localhost:8080/</a> in my web browser, I saw the results. </p>

<p>I definitely remember I was able to display any page in my browser in this way, and it was very simple, except I don’t remember what exactly I changed in the code (it was a slight change). Now, all I can see is a raw HTML code of a page, but not a page itself.</p>

<p>(this update is my response to wescpy)</p>

<p>Hello, wescpy!!! I've tried Your updated code and something didn't work well there. Perhaps, it's because I am not using a certain framework that I am supposed to use for this code. Please, take a look at this screen shot (I guess You'll need to right-click this image to see it in better resolution):

"2718083","<p>I have a situation with my MVC2 app where I have multiple pages that need to submit different information, but all need to end up at the same page.  In my old Web Forms app, I'd have just accomplished this in my btnSave_Click delegate with a Redirect.</p>

<p><strong>There are three different types of products</strong>, each of which need to be <strong>saved to the cart in a completely different manner</strong> from their completely different product pages. I'm not going to get into why or how they're different, just suffice to say, they're totally different. <strong>After they're saved to the cart, I need to ""redirect"" to the Checkout view</strong>. But it should be noted, that <strong>you can also just browse straight to the Checkout</strong> view without having to submit any products to add to the cart.</p>

<p>Here's a diagram of what I'm trying to accomplish, and how I <em>think</em> I need to handle it:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ur3do.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p><strong>Is this correct?</strong> It seems like a common scenario, but I haven't seen any examples of how I should handle this.</p>

If your widgets, whatzits, and whozits views are really that different, than it's probably not worth it to try any sort of inheritance scheme or smart view that is capable of displaying any of them depending on what's passed in as the view model.</p>

<p>If you're asking for how to handle the redirect, you should probably use RedirectToAction(""Action"", ""Checkout"") when handling the save actions on your widget, whatzit, and whozit controllers.</p>

<p>I'd suggest using bitmap masking instead.

"2719748","<p>I have the following situation. A customer uses JavaScript with jQuery to create a complex website. We would like to use JavaScript and jQuery on the server (IIS) for the following reasons: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Skills transfer - we would like to use JavaScript and jQuery on the server and not have to use eg VB Script. / classic asp. .Net framework/Java etc is ruled out because of this.</p></li>
<li><p>Improved options for search/accessibility. We would like to be able to use jQuery as a templating system, but this isn't viable for search engines and users with js turned off - unless we can selectively run this code on the server.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There is significant investment in IIS and Windows Server, so changing that is not an option.</p>

<p>I know you can run jScript on IIS using windows Script host, but am unsure of the scalability and the process surrounding this. I am also unsure whether this would have access to the DOM.</p>

<p>Here is a diagram that hopefully explains the situation. I was wondering if anyone has done anything similar?</p>

"2722754","<p>I am building my portfolio website simply using <code>HTML</code>, <code>Flash</code>, and the <code>Mootools Javascript</code> framework. I have decided to implement a theme changing feature using Javascript and cookies. When the user clicks on the ""Change Theme"" link, a <a href=""http://iaian7.com/webcode/mediaboxAdvanced"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mediaboxAdvanced</a> lightbox appears, containing a real-time form which allows you to change the theme on the portfolio.</p>

<p>Here's the code for the form:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""mb_inline"" style=""display: none; margin:15px;""&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;Change Your Theme&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;form&gt;
        &lt;fieldset&gt;
            &lt;select id=""background_color"" name=""background_color""&gt;
                &lt;option  value=""#dcf589""&gt;Original&lt;/option&gt;
                &lt;option value=""#000FFF""&gt;Blue&lt;/option&gt;
                &lt;option value=""#00FF00""&gt;Green&lt;/option&gt;
            &lt;/select&gt;
        &lt;/fieldset&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I know, there is no submit button, but as soon as something is changed in that form, the following <code>Mootools</code> code happens:</p>

<pre><code>var themeChanger = new Class(
{
    pageBody : null,

    themeOptions : null,

    initialize: function()
{
    this.pageBody = $(document.body);
    this.themeOptions = $('background_color');
    this.themeOptions.addEvent('change', this.change_theme.bindWithEvent(this));
},

change_theme: function(event)
{
    alert(""Hello"");
}
});

window.addEvent('domready', function() {
    var themeChanger_class = new themeChanger();
});
</code></pre>

<p>Now this is only a test function, which <em>should</em> be triggered when the dropdown menu changes. However, it seems that none of it works when the form is in the lightbox! Now if I decide to run the form <em>outside</em> of the lightbox, then it works great!</p>

<p>It seems it can't even access the ""background_color"" element.</p>

<p>Am I missing something?</p>

<p>If you need more examples, I will fill in on demand.</p>

<p>Thank you all in advance.</p>

<p><strong>Update (4/27/2010 - 12:54PM):</strong></p>

<hr>

<p>I looked into this a little more and have two theories about all of this.</p>

<p>1- In the <code>mediaboxAdv.js</code> file, there's the following declaration:</p>

<pre><code>$(document.body).adopt(
</code></pre>

<p>Could this keep me from accessing the body's properties, such as ""background-color""?</p>

<p>2- Could the lightbox display that form as a page on its own, hence why I cannot access the parent page's body tag?</p>

<p>3- Do I need to declare my javascript file the following way?</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""mb_inline"" style=""display: none; margin:15px;""&gt;
&lt;!-- script declaration --&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/Javascript"" src=""scripts/themeChanger.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- the form --&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Change Your Theme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;form&gt;
    &lt;fieldset&gt;
        &lt;select id=""background_color"" name=""background_color""&gt;
            &lt;option  value=""#dcf589""&gt;Original&lt;/option&gt;
            &lt;option value=""#000FFF""&gt;Blue&lt;/option&gt;
            &lt;option value=""#00FF00""&gt;Green&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;/select&gt;
    &lt;/fieldset&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Chances are I might post a link to the site so that you can see with your own eyes what I want to do.</p>
","Access <body> tag properties from form found in mediaboxAdvanced lightbox","<javascript><html><mootools><lightbox>","2010-04-27 15:53:19","791","2725481","2","<p>This is a modal window. running code on DOMREADY here is pretty pointless. There is no DOMREADY when you put some HTML into a div. I assume there's an onComplete event being fired by the lightbox/mediabox plugin that you can hook into and use it to instantiate your <code>themeChanger</code></p>

<p>Not seen the specifics of the plugin that you use but in pseudo code...</p>

<pre><code>new mediaBox({
    width: nnn,
    height: nnn,
    title: ""Change your theme"",
    text: ""your mark-up"",
    onComplete: function() {
        new themeChanger(); // will set the listener which will work with the mark-up.
    }

});
</code></pre>

<p>if the content of the window is being loaded through Request.HTML or whatever other method, you should also get an <code>onComplete</code> event you can plug into.</p>

<p>I hope this makes sense, good luck</p>

<p><em>edit</em> i stand corrected - this is not even a class but a function-based plugin (<a href=""http://iaian7.com/files/webcode/mediaboxAdv/mediaboxAdv-1.2.0.js"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://iaian7.com/files/webcode/mediaboxAdv/mediaboxAdv-1.2.0.js</a>) that uses element prototypes... it does not look as if it has support for events on content loaded. furthermore, it supports just 1 method that is suitable of supplying content in your case, <code>inline</code> which relies on the modal content already being hidden within the DOM. perhaps this is the source of your problem - if you look at <a href=""http://iaian7.com/webcode/mediaboxAdvanced#inline"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://iaian7.com/webcode/mediaboxAdvanced#inline</a> - the hidden content is copied through the <code>innerHTML</code>, it uses just <code>preload = $(URLsplit[1]).get('html');</code> and then in the <code>startEffect</code> function sets the contents of the modal window to the value of <code>preload</code>. this technique WON'T clone the events you may have done but just the HTML-events in mootools are in element storage and as such, tied to element UID. </p>

<p>Perhaps you can modify the script to add a new option, like <code>onComplete: $empty()</code> that you can call from within the <code>startEffect</code> function once it has finished animating and has added in the content.</p>

<p>good luck again. the best advice i can give you here - do not use this plugin for dialogue windows, its overkill and its not modular enough - such a shame because mootools could have been put to a great use here, it's not just a tool for DOM manipulation :)</p>

The trick is to have an invisible node that connections to the starting state. the starting state is then not the top of the hierarchy and one has a little bit more freedom in placing the nodes. Also then the head/tailport attributes work as they should.

"2726266","<p>I know this topic has been covered <em>ad nauseam</em> here, and other places on the internet - but hopefully the question is a simple one as I try to get my head around assembly... </p>

<p>So if i understand correctly the ebp (base pointer) will point to the top of the stack, and the esp (stack pointer) will point to the bottom -- since the stack grows downward. esp therefore points to the 'current location'.
So on a function call, once you've saved the ebp on the stack you insert a new stack frame - for the function. So in the case of the image below, if you started from N-3 you would go to N-2 with a function call. But when you are at N-2 - is your ebp == 25 and the esp == 24 (at least initially, before any data is placed on the stack)?</p>

<p>Is this correct or am I off on a tangent here?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

In other words, there are different orders in which a function can push things onto the stack, depending on your compiler settings (and peculiar <code>#pragma</code> options, etc, etc). </p>

<p>It looks like you are talking about the <code>cdecl</code> calling convention on the x86 architecture. In that case, the caller's <code>ebp</code> is usually pushed onto the stack immediately after the return address. So, in your example's N-2, location 25 will contain a pointer back to the calling function N-3 (ie, it will contain the address of the instruction immediately after the <code>call</code> that got you into N-2) and location 24 will contain the old <code>ebp</code>, and your esp will = 23 immediately after the call, before any locals have been pushed onto stack. (Except some compilers will make space on the stack immediately after the call, and so ESP will be 20 instead of moving up and down inside function N-2.)</p>

<p><strong>However</strong> be aware that on the x86 there is a particular optimization the compiler can sometimes do called <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2007/03/12/fpo.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">frame pointer omission</a>, which avoids pushing the old <code>ebp</code> onto the stack altogether under certain conditions.</p>

","How can I make a noisy background image using PHP?","<php><imagemagick>","2010-04-28 07:14:05","5092","2727712","2","<p>It's fairly straightforward to generate random noise.  You can accomplish this pretty easily with some of PHP's image libraries, including the <a href=""https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.image.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GD functions</a>.  I'm sure it would be similar in ImageMagick.</p>
<p>If you wanted to generate completely random noise, you could use random values for every color and every pixel.  That might look something like this with GD:</p>
<pre><code>//random colored noise
$x = 150;
$y = 150;
$im = imagecreatetruecolor($x,$y);
for($i = 0; $i &lt; $x; $i++) {
    for($j = 0; $j &lt; $y; $j++) {
        $color = imagecolorallocate($im, rand(0,255), rand(0,255), rand(0,255));
        imagesetpixel($im, $i, $j, $color);
    }
}    
header('Content-Type: image/png');
imagepng($im);
</code></pre>
<p>Generates this:  <img src=""https://i559.photobucket.com/albums/ss37/womzom/randomnoise1.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>
<p>However, the example image that you posted clearly doesn't look like completely random color noise.  It seems more like an arbitrary choice between one of two colors, either a somewhat-grey pixel or a somewhat-colored pixel.  You could accomplish that more like this:</p>
<pre><code>//two-color random noise
$x = 150;
$y = 150;
$im = imagecreatetruecolor($x,$y);
$color1 = imagecolorallocate($im, 200, 240, 242);
$color2 = imagecolorallocate($im,220,220,220);
imagefill($im,0,0,$color1);
for($i = 0; $i &lt; $x; $i++) {
    for($j = 0; $j &lt; $y; $j++) {
        if (mt_rand(0,1) == 1) imagesetpixel($im, $i, $j, $color2);
    }

imagepng($im);
</code></pre>
<p>Generates this:  <img src=""https://i559.photobucket.com/albums/ss37/womzom/randomnoise2.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>
<p>Your example seems a bit more complex still, with the pixels seeming to appear in small groups to produce a blockier appearance.  You could emulate that by adjusting the loop logic if you wanted, or coloring small squares instead of individual pixels.</p>
<p>An interesting thing about this type of generation is that you can actually see the breakdown of the <code>rand()</code> function on Windows platforms if you use it instead of <code>mt_rand()</code>.  <a href=""http://dog-net.org/content/development/php/rand-or-mt-rand-/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Discernible patterns can develop</a> in the noise due to limitations in that function/platform combination.</p>

<p>You obviously won't get the listbox's scrollbar to go to the bottom of the screen, but you could fix that by putting in a ScrollBar control.</p>

<p>Editing templates might yield what you want but you may simply run into a point where items at the bottom of the list could be hidden by the button panel. You could overcome this obviously by increasing the bottom padding of the last item in that list or a similar margin/padding hack.</p>

<p>However, I don't think sizing the scrollbar to the bottom is the best idea in terms of common sense in user interfaces as scrollbars should conventionally be placed on the side of only what is scrollable.</p>

<p>The CustomValidator will include server sided validation code. I would like the error message to be cleared via client sided script if the user alters teh date value in any way. To do this, I included the following code to hook up the two drop downs and the year text box to the validation control:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
    ValidatorHookupControlID(""&lt;%= ddlMonth.ClientID%&gt;"", document.getElementById(""&lt;%= CustomValidator1.ClientID%&gt;""));
    ValidatorHookupControlID(""&lt;%= ddlDate.ClientID%&gt;"", document.getElementById(""&lt;%= CustomValidator1.ClientID%&gt;""));
    ValidatorHookupControlID(""&lt;%= txtYear.ClientID%&gt;"", document.getElementById(""&lt;%= CustomValidator1.ClientID%&gt;""));
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, I would also like the Validation error to be cleared when the user clicks the clear button. When the user clicks the Clear button, the other 3 controls are reset. To avoid a Post back, the Clear button is a regular HTML button with an OnClick event that resets the 3 controls. Unfortunately, the ValidatorHookupControlID method does not seem to work on HTML controls, so I thought to change the HTML Button to an ASP button and to Hookup to that control instead. However, I cannot seem to eliminate the Postback functionality associated by default with the ASP button control. I tried to set the UseSubmitBehavior to False, but it still submits. I tried to return false in my btnClear_OnClick client code, but the code sent to the  browser included a DoPostback call after my call.</p>

<pre><code>btnClear.Attributes.Add(""onClick"", ""btnClear_OnClick();"")
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of adding OnClick code, I tried overwriting it, but the DoPostBack code was still included in the final code that was sent to the browser.</p>

<p>What do I have to do to get the Clear button to clear the CustomValidator error when clicked and avoid a postback?</p>

"2736000","<p>This particular problem is driving me nuts. I wonder if anyone has experienced a similar problem. If I load up a workflow then unload it and perform a memory snapshot then the result is predictable - my workflow is no longer in memory. However, if I load up a workflow and set the PersistableIdle action to PersistableIdleAction.Unload and let the workflow idle the workflow remains in memory even though the Unload action fires.</p>

<p>I used ANTS Memory Profiler to debug this issue. This is the object retention graph outputted showing that an internal object is hanging onto my workflow instance. </p>

<p>Can anyone else verify this problem? My code amounts to the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create SqlWorkflowInstanceStore and setup lock owner handle<br>
-- At this point I take a memory snapshot</li>
<li>Create an instance of Workflow1</li>
<li>Set the PersistableIdle action</li>
<li>Apply the instancestore to Workflow1</li>
<li>Setup action event handlers for Idle, Unload, UnhandledException etc.</li>
<li>Persist the workflow instance</li>
<li>Run the workflow instance</li>
<li>Wait for instance to idle (caused by Delay activity)</li>
<li>Ensure the Unload action is fired<br>
-- At this point I take a second memory snapshot</li>
</ol>

<p>From the above image, it is clear that the only object referencing Workflow1 is some internal event handlers result which I have no ability to dispose of.</p>

<li><p>How sure are you that the unload action is really completed at the time of profiling (vs about to happen asynchronously, etc)?</p></li>
<li><p>It seems like the asynchronous chain is OK but the TdsParserStateObject would probably be the real object being leaked. I notice that class has a Dispose() method but doesn't implement IDisposable. So another idea is that Dispose() is used to manually 'reset' or 'recycle' the object at some distinct point in time - but that point in time turns out to be 'not yet (unload time) but later', e.g. lazy recycling. Does your profiler let you see whether the number of TdsParserStateObjects over time is increasing, to indicate a real leak there? As opposed to 'just a finite number of objects so not a real leak' leak.</p></li>

If the user clicks the standard edit / delete buttons, your <code>OnRowCommand</code> method will still be executed first, and probably that's why they stopped working.<br>
It is not clear why you need the redirect, but you should make sure to call it only upon the execution of one of your custom commands.</p>

"2736380","<p>According to the specification,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Black colour blocks and the edges of the program restrict program flow. If the Piet interpreter attempts to move into a black block or off an edge, it is stopped and the CC is toggled. The interpreter then attempts to move from its current block again. If it fails a second time, the DP is moved clockwise one step. These attempts are repeated, with the CC and DP being changed between alternate attempts. If after eight attempts the interpreter cannot leave its current colour block, there is no way out and the program terminates.</p>

<p>Specifically, why does the DP turn left at (0,3) ((0,0) being (top, left)) when it hits the left edge?  At this point, both DP and CC are LEFT, so, by my reading, the sequence should then be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attempt (and fail) to leave the block by going off the edge at (0,4),</li>
<li>Toggle CC to RIGHT,</li>
<li>Attempt (and fail) to leave the block by going off the edge at (0,2).</li>
<li>Rotate DP to UP,</li>
<li>Attempt (and succeed) to leave the block at (1,2) by entering the white block at (1,1)</li>

<p>If you wanted to guarantee that you'd never place the red or green squares inside the white box, you could use the following simple algorithm:</p>

<li><p>Divide the gray area into 8 rectangular regions <em>R</em> = {<em>R<sub>1</sub></em>, <em>R<sub>2</sub></em>, ... <em>R<sub>8</sub></em>}, defined by the white box. (Imagine a tic-tac-toe grid with the white box at the center; this defines the surrounding eight regions.)</p></li>
<li><p>Let P(<em>S</em> is placed in <em>R<sub>i</sub></em>) = A(<em>R<sub>i</sub></em>) / A(<em>R</em>), where A(<em>R<sub>i</sub></em>) is the area in which the center of <em>S</em> can be placed: that is, a region which is of area (<em>h<sub>R<sub>i</sub></sub></em> - <em>h<sub>S</sub></em>) &middot; (<em>w<sub>R<sub>i</sub></sub></em> - <em>w<sub>S</sub></em>).</p></li>

<p>To summarize: I want the JList to show <strong>as many rows as the size of the parsed ArrayList</strong>, <strong>without a scrollbar</strong>.</p>

<p>Here is the picture of the problem:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Rf04g.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Rf04g.png"" alt=""jlist 1""></a></p>

<p>Here's the link to the other 2 as the picture resolution is quite big I'm scared it will distort the view:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Rf04g.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JList 1</a> &amp; <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/C0I2o.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JList 2</a></p>

<p>The JList 1 and 2 pictures shows it clearly. The JList displays empty rows, which I do not want it to happen.</p>

<p>Any ideas? Please help. Thanks. Please let me know if a picture of the problem is needed in case I did not phrase my question correctly.</p>

<pre><code>JScrollPane scrollPane = new JScrollPane(textPane);
scrollPane.setPreferredSize(new Dimension(200, 200));

From what I can see, the <code>listForSuggestions</code> should not occupy more space than it needs to display those items, if it's preferred size is respected.</p>

<p>So the <code>JTextPane</code> is a <code>Container</code>, that is, you can add subcomponents to it. But how are those subcomponents layed out? That is up to the layout manager currently in use. If the layout manager respects the preferred dimension of the <code>listForSuggestios</code> I think you should be ok. Not sure though.</p>

<p>From what I can see, you get the ""null-layout"" by just instantiating a <code>JTextPane</code>, which means that unless you set another layout manager explicitly, you would need to take care of placement / resizing of the subcomponents yourself.</p>

<p>You could try to do something like</p>

<p>I think the most elegant way of doing this is to roll your own layout-manager. (It's actually quite simple.) And then, instead of doing <code>textPane.add(list)</code>, you do <code>textPane.add(list, YourLayoutManager.POPUP_LIST)</code>. The layout-manager then remembers the fact that <code>list</code> was supposed to be layed out according to it's preferred size, and layes it out accordingly in its <code>layoutContainer</code>-method. (If you give the <code>YourLayoutManager</code> a reference to the <code>JTextPane</code> that it is attached to, you could probably even make it layout the <code>list</code> right beside the current caret location.)</p>

<p><code>Foo.Bar()</code> is a function call which generates a unique path (for example). So it's NOT constant.</p>

<p>In VB.NET it's possible by entering the function's name in the Watch, which will then threat it as a variable.</p>

<p>Obviously I have mocked out the actual requirements but the essence is similar. </p>

<ul>
<li>Entering a name and clicking history should bring up a pop up pointing to the url '/student/viewhistory/{name}'</li>
<li>Name and age are required fields</li>
<li>The sub form (in the mockup) with Class (a drop down, containing the numbers 1 -> 10) and Subject (containing A -> D, say) form a unique pair of values for which a score is required.

First I place a div inside the jquery with empty fields like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(""#add"").click(function() {
    $(""#classes"").append($(
    ""&lt;div&gt;"" 
    +""   &lt;select name='Student.Classes[0].Class'&gt;""
    +""     &lt;option value='1'&gt;Class 1&lt;/option&gt;""
            ....
    +""  &lt;/select&gt;""
    +""   &lt;select name='Student.Classes[0].Subject'&gt;""
    +""     &lt;option value='1'&gt;Subject 1&lt;/option&gt;""
            ....
    +""  &lt;/select&gt;""
    +""  &lt;input name='Student.Classes[0].Score' value='0'/&gt;""
    +""&lt;/div&gt;""
    )
);});
</code></pre>

<p>This div will added to the list of classes when something with the id #add is clicked.</p>

<p>Next I catch the form before the submit and give each entity (Student.Classes in this case) an index starting from 0. Like this:</p>

<pre><code> $(""form"").submit(function () {
        $(""div"", ""#classes"").each(function (i) {
            $("":input, :hidden"", this).each(function () {
                $(this).attr(""name"", $(this).attr(""name"").replace(/\[0\]/, ""["" + i + ""]""));
            });
        });
    });
</code></pre>

<p>If your are using a ModelBinder that supports sub entities this should end up on the server with a list of Classes within the Student. Of course you can use firebug to see exactly what is being posted to the server.</p>

<p>If the user selects ""Retired"", the requirement is to prefill ""Retired"" in the ""Specify Occupation"" text box and to disable it to prevent it from being changed. The Specify Occupation text box should also no longer be a tab stop. If the user selects a radio button other than Retired the Specify Occupation text box should be enabled and once again and the Specify Occupation text box should once again be in the normal tab sequence.</p>

<p>Originally, I was setting and clearing the disabled property on the Specify occupation textbox, then I found out that, upon submitting the form, disabled fields are excluded from the submit and the REQUIRED validator on the Specify Occupation textbox was being raised because the textbox was being blanked out.</p>

<p>What is the best way to solve this? My approach below was to mimic a disabled text box by setting/resetting the readonly attribute on the text box and changing the background color to make it appear disabled. (I suppose I should be changing the forecolor instead of teh background color). Nevertheless, my code to make the textbox readonly and to reset it doesn't appear to be working.</p>

        var optOccupationOther = document.getElementById(""&lt;%= optOccupationOther.ClientId %&gt;"");

        txtSpecifyOccupation.value = ""Retired""
        txtSpecifyOccupation.readonly = ""readonly"";
        txtSpecifyOccupation.style.backgroundColor = ""#E0E0E0"";
        txtSpecifyOccupation.tabIndex = -1;

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Vzvb9.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Vzvb9.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>Which is not very aesthetic, I would like to have the whole cell in a different colour, not only the part behind the text. Here is the code part:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;DataGridTextColumn
    Binding=""{Binding Path=PrivateMemorySize, StringFormat='#,##0'}"" 
    Header=""Memory Size"" &gt;
    &lt;DataGridTextColumn.ElementStyle&gt;
        &lt;Style TargetType=""{x:Type TextBlock}""&gt;
            &lt;Setter Property=""HorizontalAlignment"" Value=""Right"" /&gt;
            &lt;Style.Triggers&gt;
                &lt;DataTrigger Binding=""{Binding Path=PrivateMemorySize,
                            Converter={StaticResource isLarge}, 
                            ConverterParameter=20000000}"" Value=""true""&gt;
                    &lt;Setter Property=""Background"" Value=""Yellow"" /&gt;
                &lt;/DataTrigger&gt;
            &lt;/Style.Triggers&gt;
        &lt;/Style&gt;
    &lt;/DataGridTextColumn.ElementStyle&gt;
&lt;/DataGridTextColumn&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>isLarge</code> is just a converter that returns <code>true</code> when the cell value is greater than the parameter)</p>

<p>If I define a style for the DataGridCell target, the result is the same.</p>

<p>Any idea on what could be wrong? I'm not using anything fancy, just the default DataGrid (which is linked in this example to CLR objects to fill in the table).</p>

"2746875","<p>I'm currently exploring worst case scenarios of atomic commit protocols like 2PC and 3PC and am stuck at the point that I can't find out <strong>why 3PC can guarantee atomicity</strong>. That is, how does it guarantee that if cohort A commits, cohort B also commits?</p>

<p>Here's the simplified <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3PC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3PC from the Wikipedia article</a>:</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/Three-phase_commit_diagram.png"" alt=""3PC commit protocol as depicted on English Wikipedia""></p>

<p>Now let's assume the following case:</p>

<ol>
<li>Two cohorts participate in the transaction (A and B)</li>
<li>Both do their work, then vote for commit</li>
<li>Coordinator now sends precommit messages...

<ul>
<li>A receives the precommit message, acknowledges, and then goes offline for a long time</li>
<li>B doesn't receive the precommit message (whatever the reason might be) and is thus still in ""uncertain"" state</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>The results:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Coordinator aborts</strong> the transaction because not all precommit messages were sent and acknowledged successfully</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>, who is in precommit state, is still offline, thus times out and <strong>commits</strong></li>
<li><strong>B aborts</strong> in any case: He either stays offline and times out (causes abort) or comes online and receives the abort command from the coordinator</li>
</ul>

<p>And there you have it: One cohort committed, another aborted. <strong>The transaction is screwed.</strong></p>

<p>So what am I missing here? In my understanding, if the automatic commit on timeout (in precommit state) was replaced by infinitely waiting for a coordinator command, that case should work fine.</p>

The case you've noted, where ""A"" simply goes off-line, translates to the ""the network has been segmented"" -- i.e. ""A"" is now in one segment, while ""B"" and the ""Coordinator"" are in another segment.</p>

<p>Various enhanced 3PC protocols to deal with this problem are discussed (among other places) in a <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c7c6/e4a790582b776eca168f60ca27d4bd8d2a3a.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">paper</a> by Kempster, Stirling and Thannish.</p>

"2747501","<p>I am struggling with the configuration for the scenario below. </p>

<ul>
<li>I have a custom WCF/WIF STS (RP-STS) that provides security tokens to my WCF services</li>
<li>RP-STS is an ""Active"" STS</li>
<li>RP-STS acts as a claims transformation STS</li>
<li>RP-STS trusts tokens from many customer-specific identity provider STSes (IdP-STS)</li>
<li>When a WCF Client connects to a service it should authenticate with it's local IdP-STS</li>
</ul>

<p>The reading that I've done describes this as Home Realm Discovery. HRD is usually described within the context of web applications and Passive STSes. My questions is, for my situation, does the logic for choosing an IdP-STS endpoint belong in the RP-STS or the WCF Client application?</p>

<p>I thought it belonged in the RP-STS, but I cannot figure out the configuration to make this happen. RP-STS has a single endpoint, but I cannot figure out how to add more than one trusted issuer per endpoint.</p>

<p>Any guidance on this would be very appreciated (I'm out of useful keywords to Google.) Also, if I'm way off please offer alternative approaches.</p>

"2748564","<p>I am currently writing a small application with Python (3.1), and like a good little boy, I am doctesting as I go. However, I've come across a method that I can't seem to doctest. It contains an <code>input()</code>, an because of that, I'm not entirely sure what to place in the ""expecting"" portion of the doctest.</p>

<p>Example code to illustrate my problem follows:</p>

<pre><code>""""""

Please type in a number:

numbers = list()

# stores 5 user-entered numbers (strings, for now) in a list
def getFiveNums():
    print(""Howdy. Please enter five numbers, hit &lt;enter&gt; after each one"")
    for i in range(5):
        newNum = input(""Please type in a number:"")
        numbers.append(newNum)
    print(""Here are your numbers: "", numbers)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    doctest.testmod(verbose=True)
</code></pre>

<p>When running the doctests, the program stops executing immediately after printing the ""Expecting"" section, waits for me to enter five numbers one after another (without prompts), and then continues. As shown below:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Svf1r.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Svf1r.jpg"" alt=""doctest results""></a>

<p>I don't know what, if anything, I can place in the Expecting section of my doctest to be able to test a method that receives and then displays user input. So my question (finally) is, <strong>is this function doctestable?</strong></p>

I use doctests for documentation more than testing and the doctest for this wouldn't make good documentation IMHO.  </p>

<p>A unitest approach may look like:</p>

<pre><code>import unittest

    print ""Howdy. Please enter five numbers, hit &lt;enter&gt; after each one""

        numbers.append(newNum)
    return numbers

    return 1

        self.saved_input = __builtins__.input
        __builtins__.input = mock_input

    def testGetFiveNums(self):
        printed_lines = getFiveNums()
        self.assertEquals(printed_lines, [1, 1, 1, 1, 1])

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    unittest.main()

<p>It's maybe not exactally testing the function you put forward but you get the idea. </p>

"2753559","<p>I create a Silverlight Chart, with the Silverlight 4 toolkit, the April release.</p>

<p>Consider the following chart:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;Grid x:Name=""LayoutRoot"" Background=""White""&gt;
  &lt;Charting:Chart Title=""Chart to test"" Name=""MySuperChart""&gt;
   &lt;Charting:LineSeries x:Name=""MyLineSeries"" Title=""Something"" /&gt;
  &lt;/Charting:Chart&gt;
 &lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So far so good. I can access the Series in the chart by <code>MySuperChart.Series[0]</code> But when I try to reference MyLineSeries, it appears to be null.

","Silverlight 4 toolkit, charting and lineSeries is null","<silverlight><charts><silverlight-toolkit>","2010-05-02 13:17:03","2585","2757381","1","<p>This is an interesting little gotcha.  It helps if you look a bit under the hood at how the variable <code>MyLineSeries</code> is created and assigned.  Navigate to the definition of the <code>InitializeComponent</code> method.  You will end up at the MainPage.g.cs generated file.  It will contain this field:-</p>

<pre><code>internal System.Windows.Controls.DataVisualization.Charting.LineSeries MyLineSeries;
</code></pre>

<p>and in the <code>InitializeComponent</code> you will find this line:-</p>

<pre><code>this.MyLineSeries = ((System.Windows.Controls.DataVisualization.Charting.LineSeries)(this.FindName(""MyLineSeries"")));
</code></pre>

<p>So on the surface of it by the time the call to <code>InitializeComponent</code> in your constructor has completed the <code>MyLineSeries</code> should have been assigned a value.  However as you can see its still null, hence it can be concluded that <code>FindName(""MyLineSeries"")</code> failed to find the series.  So the question is why did it fail?</p>

<p><strong>Why Doesn't FindName Work?</strong></p>

<p><code>FindName</code> searches what is refered to in the documentation as the ""object tree"", looking for an object that has the name specified (there are added complications of what are known as namescopes but that is not at play here).  Typically objects end up in the ""object tree"" through common base types like <code>Panel</code> or <code>ContentControl</code> which have propeties such as <code>Children</code> and <code>Child</code> respectively.  These properties are specified in the <code>ContentProperty</code> attribute on the classes which allows for the UI structure to be described more naturally.  E.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Button x:Name=""MyButton""&gt;
  &lt;Image x:Name=""MyImage"" ... /&gt;
&lt;/Button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of </p>

<pre><code>&lt;Button x:Name=""MyButton""&gt;
  &lt;Button.Child&gt;
    &lt;Image x:Name=""MyImage"" ... /&gt;
  &lt;/Button.Child&gt;
&lt;/Button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Chart</code> control, on the other hand, is not a simple <code>Panel</code> derivative and has a lot more work to do to build its UI.  In the case of the <code>Chart</code> the <code>ContentPropertyAttribute</code> specifies the <code>Series</code> collection parameter.  This allows your more natural Xaml:-</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Charting:Chart Title=""Chart to test"" Name=""MySuperChart""&gt;
  &lt;Charting:LineSeries x:Name=""MyLineSeries"" Title=""Something"" /&gt;
&lt;/Charting:Chart&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However because <code>Chart</code> has a lot of extra work in order do determine what exactly should be in the ""object tree"" that will represent its final UI the series collection items don't immediately become part of the ""object tree"".  As result the <code>FindName</code> in the <code>InitializeComponent</code> simply doesn't find them.</p>

<p><strong>Work Around - Option 1</strong></p>

<p>You could use your knowledge of the ordinal position of ""MyLineSeries"" in the chart to handle the assignment of a <code>MyLineSeries</code> variable in the constructor.  Remove the <code>x:Name=""MyLineSeries""</code> from the Xaml then in code:-</p>

<pre><code>public partial MainPage : UserControl
{
  private LineSeries MyLineSeries;

  public MainPage()
  {
    InitializeComponent();
    MyLineSeries = (LineSeries)MySuperChart.Series[0];
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Work Around - Option 2</strong></p>

<p>You could wait until the series is available in the ""object tree"" which is true once the containing <code>UserControl</code> has fired its <code>Loaded</code> event:-</p>

<pre><code>public partial MainPage : UserControl
{
  public MainPage()
  {
    InitializeComponent();
    Loaded += (s, args) =&gt;
    {
      MyLineSeries = (LineSeries)FindName(""MyLineSeries"");
    }
  }
}

Edit your break-point, then add a ""Breakpoint Action"" by pressing the plus icon under your breakpoint in the ""Breakpoints"" window. Select ""Debugger Command"" from the action type drop-down menu, then type in your command (without the semi-colon). Note that what you can enter here is gdb, not straight Objective-C, so some things won't work as you might expect (such as dot-notation).</p>

<p>You can also type in gdb commands in the Debugger Console while the debugger (gdb) is paused, so you can set a breakpoint, type in a command, then hit continue to see if it did what you were expecting.</p>

"2754613","<p>I do the web page for my local library, and I was thinking it might be kind of appealing to have a ""custom"" captcha based on book covers. So serve up one of several dozen book covers, and have the patron filling out the form type the book title to prove they're human. Assuming I stripped the title/author info from the image and filename, would that be enough? Would the fact that it was a unique system on a fairly small website be enough to make it effective? Just how tricky are the spam bots these days?
Would having the image name be the ISBN # be too obvious?</p>

<p>Here is a sample cover: </p>

<p>As a matter of principle, it makes sense to NOT base the image name on something that can be looked up, although in the case of a local library, chances are low that any spammers will be writing custom scripts to defeat your captcha...</p>

<p>How would I go about getting the words to fill in whatever space possible above them before starting a new line? I'm not talking about reorganizing them to find the absolute minimum number of lines required. If I was going through the list in the image, 'pendant', 'howlite', and 'igrice' would go to line 1 filling it up, 'roughdiamond' would go to line 2 because line 1 is full, 'tourmaline' would go to line 3 because it can't fit on lines 1 or 2, same with 'emberald', but 'pearl' would go to line 2 because it can fit there since there is extra space. I figure there would probably be some way of doing this in CSS that would simply cause the links to collapse into any fillable space it can fit in to.</p>

"2762908","<p>I'm creating a web app that allows users to enter a number of colors, by specifying RGB values. Upon submission, the user will see a canvas with a solid rectangle drawn in the color chosen. </p>

<p>On this page, I have 7 canvases. The first one draws just fine, but none of the rest show up. The browser is Safari. Here's the relevant code:</p>

<p>First, the script element in the header, which defines the function I use to draw to the canvas.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script language=""JavaScript"" TYPE=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;!--
function drawCanvas(canvasId, red, green, blue) {
var theCanvas = document.getElementById(""canvas"" + canvasId);

     context.setFillColor(red,green,blue,1.0);
     context.fillRect(0,0,100,100);
    }
    // --&gt;
    &lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Next, the HTML source, where I have my canvas tags and some embedded Javascript to call my drawCanvas function</p>

<pre><code>&lt;canvas id=""canvas0"" width=""100"" height=""100""&gt;
  &lt;/canvas&gt;


   &lt;script language=""JavaScript"" TYPE=""text/javascript""&gt;&lt;!--

   // --&gt;

This occurs in both Safari and Chrome.  Unfortunately I cannot find a documentation for <code>setFillColor</code> (the coming HTML5 standard uses a different approach and does not appear to define such a method) so I can't check whether that's a webkit bug (webkit being what both Safari and Chrome are using for rendering) or a difference in what args <code>setFillColor</code> wants!</p>

<p>The table could of course then have all the indexes you like. If you ran the export every 10 minutes and the possibility of getting data that is 9 minutes and 59 seconds out of date is not a problem, then your queries will be lightning fast.</p>

<p>The only part of concern would be managing locking and concurrency during the export time. One strategy might be to export the data into a new table and then through renames swap it into place. Another might be to use SYNONYMs (SQL 2005 and up) to do something similar where you just point the SYNONYM to two alternating tables.</p>

<p>The data that supplies the query you're performing comes from a completely different system outside of SQL Server. There's no way that SQL Server can create an indexed view on data it does not own. For starters, how would it be notified when something had been changed so it could update its indexes? There would have to be some notification and update mechanism, which is implausible because SQL Server could not reasonably maintain ACID for such a distributed, slow, non-SQL server transaction to an outside system.</p>

<p>Thus my suggestion for mimicking such a thing through your own scheduled jobs that refresh the data every X minutes.</p>

<p>--Responding to your comment--</p>

<p>You can't tell whether a new user has been added without querying. If Active Directory supports some API that generates events, I've never heard of it.</p>

<p>But, each time you query, you could store the greatest creation time of all the users in a table, then through dynamic SQL, query only for new users with a creation date after that. This query should theoretically be very fast as it would pull very little data across the wire. You would just have to look into what the exact AD field would be for the creation date of the user and the syntax for conditions on that field.</p>

<p>If managing the dynamic SQL was too tough, a very simple vbscript, VB, or .Net application could also query active directory for you on a schedule and update the database.</p>

<p>One explanation is that pre- and post-build events are stored in the project file, which goes into source control and is shared between all developers.  Therefore it's important to have macros that resolve to different paths on different developers' machines.</p>

<p>Command arguments on the Debug property page are stored in the .user project file, which is user-specific and isn't stored in source control.  Which means that you can generally safely used hard-wired arguments that are specific to your machine (and specific to the cases you want to test).</p>

<p>For instance, every time I display a 180KB .doc file, I get a 100KB leak. And that happens with both the simulator and an actual device, running OS 3.1.3.</p>

<p>To see the leak, use the ObjectAlloc instrument, switch to the view where you see individual allocation objects, and sort by size so that you see the large ones in a group, just like in my picture above. Then view a Office document a few times and find the Malloc objects that keep staying ""Live"" even after the actual UIWebView has been freed.</p>

<p>Is this a known bug? Or is there any way I can avoid these leaks? I.e, have you successfully shown Office documents on an iPhone withing getting such leaks?</p>

<p>My question comes, although i can use UI framework tool, such as:
Phonegap, 
iui, 
jtquery 
to develop web app, but i can't display the TitleBar effect in Android, </p>

<p>i can't use below code in Android:
  meta content=""yes"" name=""apple-mobile-web-app-capable""</p>

<p>Actually, the above can work in Apple Safari Browser, but I can't use Safari to display our Android Project, which is i don't want to see.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to fulfill this effect in Android, please help me, your help will be great appreciated.</p>

<p>sorry that i forget to mention, i want to develop a iphone-webapp-style application in Android.

","How to implement iPhone TitleBar in Android","<iphone><android><titlebar>","2010-05-07 07:00:24","7543","2787173","1","<p>If I'm not mistaken, if you want to custom in any way the title bar at the top of your screen, you have to do several things :</p>

<p>First, read <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2251714/set-title-background-color/2251787#2251787"">this thread about titlebar customisation</a>, as it's quite detailled.
Then, you have to add a few more things to it to match your requirements, all in the same xml file which will be your <strong>titlebar.xml</strong>:</p>

<p>-a <strong>button</strong>, on which listener you assign the same keyEvent as the normal back key of every android phone.</p>

<p>-a <strong>textview</strong> for whatever title you want to put in.</p>

<p>-a <strong>button</strong> for the command button, for whatever it does in Iphone (if you tell me what it does, maybe i'll be able to give more details)</p>

<p>Then, as I take it, you want to have it available on all your pages, without having to request titlebar customization on every activity, I would recommend you to use the same trick as I did : <strong>Define a superclass</strong>, which all your activities will extend.
then you you requestwindowfeatures in this class, and do all your customization in this one.Finnaly, You just have to call the variable of your titlebar textview in the oncreate of all your subclasses to assign the string you want on each page. If your string is generated dynamically from, lets say a file name you load from the internetv in a background thread, you will need to define a handler to the main thread as you can't update a view from another thread than the one that has created it.</p>

<p>Hopes that helps. If you have any question about that, feel free to ask, i'll keep an eye on your topic, because I had quite a pain to make my titlebar work properly.
good luck</p>

<p>Anyone had a smiliar bug? The control is placed from Interface Builder and not modified in any way by code. It was working fine until some time ago after a random build the bug appeared. Happens in two places in my app while the same exact kind of setup is fine inside another viewcontroller. In all cases the controls are inside a UINavigationItem. Deleting the control and re adding it didn't change anything. This only appreas on an actual device, never in the simulator.</p>

"2794212","<p>Basically I'm a tad confused. You'll see at <a href=""http://furnace.howcode.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://furnace.howcode.com</a> , in the second column, the bottom scrollbar button is extended slightly beyond the end of the viewport.

<p>Can you have a look? It's probably something simple that I've just missed! :)</p>

[CSS]","<css><xhtml><viewport>","2010-05-08 13:18:34","378","2794301","2","<p>It's because you have used a fixed pixel height on <code>#tabscontainer</code> but a percentage on <code>#ajaxresults</code>. Resizing the window will show (or cut) more of the scrollbar since 90px won't always be 10% of the viewport.</p>

<p>The easiest way to fix this is to set <code>#tabscontainer</code> to have <code>height:10%</code>.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Just noticed your comment about the tabs being a fixed height. Looking for an alternative fix.</p>

<p>Okay, found a fix though I haven't tested this in IE so you may want to have a look at that ;)</p>

<ol>
<li>Give <code>#col2</code> a <code>position:relative</code></li>
<li>Remove <code>height:90%</code>, <code>min-height:90%</code> and <code>max-height:90%</code> from <code>#ajaxresults</code>.</li>
<li>Give <code>#ajaxresults</code>: <code>position:absolute</code>, <code>top:90px</code> and <code>bottom:0</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Try that out and it should work as intended, but like I said I haven't checked IE so you may need to do a little more hacking to get it to work there.</p>

<p>As a side note, accessing the member of a <code>struct</code> through a pointer to that <code>struct</code> is so common that you have a special <code>-&gt;</code> operator in C to do just that. So instead of <code>(*foo).bar</code> you can write <code>foo-&gt;bar</code>.</p>

"2797853","<p>Basically on my window (when you click the icon) it should open and show the URL of the tab and next to it I want it to say ""Save"", it will save it to the localStorage, and to be displayed below into the saved links area.</p>

<p>Like this:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/V5IcC.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/V5IcC.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>Something like bookmarks :)</p>
","Get URL and save it | Chrome Extension","<html><google-chrome><google-chrome-extension><local-storage>","2010-05-09 14:05:27","46020","2797972","3","<p>If you want to do something like that, you easily do that with the Chrome extensions API. The areas to look for are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Chrome Extension <a href=""http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tab API</a></li>
<li>Chrome Extension <a href=""http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/browserAction.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Browser Action API</a></li>
<li>HTML5 <a href=""http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/api_other.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">localStorage</a> or HTML5 <a href=""http://dev.w3.org/html5/webdatabase/"" rel=""noreferrer"">webdatabase</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Now the first step is to create your popup.html file and remember that it is transient, that is, it only lives when you click on the browser action, then dies if it exits (closes). What I am trying to say, if you have a lot of computation and you want it to happen in the background and happen even if the popup is closed, move everything to the <a href=""http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/background_pages.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">background page</a>. And in your popup, you can easily access the background page by using chrome.extension.getBackgroundPage()</p>

<p>Within your popup.html, you would need to get the URL of the current tab, to do so, the Tab API has a ""<a href=""http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs.html#method-getSelected"" rel=""noreferrer"">getSelected</a>"" function that allows you to get the <a href=""http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/tabs.html#type-Tab"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tab object</a> for the selected Tab.</p>

<p>So something like this:</p>

<p><strong>popup.html</strong></p>

<pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p id=""currentLink""&gt;Loading ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul id=""savedLinks""&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;script type=""text/javascript"" src=""popup.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>popup.js</strong></p>

<pre><code>chrome.tabs.getSelected(null, function(tab) {
    document.getElementById('currentLink').innerHTML = tab.url;
});
</code></pre>

<p>The reason why you cannot place JavaScript code in the HTML file is of Chrome's limitation to protect its users of JavaScript attacks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Inline scripts and event handlers disallowed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that will allow you to show the Url in the popup for the current page as a browser action. Your next step is to use simple HTML5 features such as localStorage, or Webdatabase (in my opinion that will be better). To store the saved pages into, then you can render them on the savedLinks page same as I have done for the currentLink.</p>

<p>Good Luck!</p>

"2798922","<p>Where, in Windows, is this <img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/lBFti.png"" alt=""Yellow-Blue Windows Security Icon""> icon stored? I need to use it in a TaskDialog emulation for XP and am having a hard time tracking it down.</p>

<p>Of course, you don't <em>have</em> to go spelunking around DLLs to extract images (although it certainly does make it easier at design time when you can design your design with a design time interface).</p>

<p>Microsoft provides a couple of supported (and therefore guaranteed) ways that you can get ahold of the shield icon at runtime:</p>

<pre><code>hIconShield = LoadIcon(0, IDI_SHIELD);
</code></pre>

<p>Although <strong>LoadIcon</strong> has been ""superseded"" by <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms648045(v=vs.85).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>LoadImage</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>hIconShield = LoadImage(0, IDI_SHIELD, IMAGE_ICON, desiredWith, desiredHeight, LR_SHARED); //passing LR_SHARED causes size to be ignored. And you must pass LR_SHARED
</code></pre>

<h2>Loading the size you want - by avoiding shared images</h2>

<p>In order to avoid loading a <em>""shared""</em> version of the icon, you have to load the icon directly out of the file.</p>

<p>We all know that the shield exists in <code>user32.dll</code> as resource id <code>106</code>:</p>

<pre><code>| Icon             | Standard Icon ID  | Real Resource ID |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| IDI_APPLICATION  | 32512             | 100              |
| IDI_QUESTION     | 32514             | 102              |
| IDI_WINLOGO      | 32517             | 105              |

| IDI_ERROR        | 32513             | 103              |
| IDI_INFORMATION  | 32516             | 104              |
| IDI_SHIELD       | 32518             | 106              |
</code></pre>

<p>That was undocumented spellunking. </p>

<p><strong>SHGetStockIconInfo</strong> can give us the actual, current, guaranteed to change in the future, path and index:</p>

<pre><code>TSHStockIconInfo sii;
ZeroMemory(@sii, SizeOf(sii));
sii.cbSize := SizeOf(sii);
SHGetStockIconInfo(SIID_SHIELD, SHGSI_ICONLOCATION, {var}sii);
</code></pre>

<p>resulting in:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>sii.szPath</strong>: <code>C:\WINDOWS\System32\imageres.dll</code></li>
<li><strong>sii.iIcon</strong>: <code>-78</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You can load this image for the size you desire using <code>LoadImage</code>:</p>

<pre><code>HMODULE hmod := LoadLibrary(sii.szPath);
Integer nIconIndex := Abs(sii.iIcon); //-78 --&gt; 78
ico = LoadImage(hmod, MAKEINTRESOURCE(nIconIndex), IMAGE_ICON, 256, 256, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>Another slightly easier way is to use <code>SHDefExtractIcon</code>:</p>

<pre><code>HICON GetStockIcon(DWORD StockIconID, Integer IconSize)
{
    HRESULT hr;

    TSHStockIconInfo sii;
    ZeroMemory(@sii, SizeOf(sii));
    sii.cbSize := SizeOf(sii);
    hr = SHGetStockIconInfo(SIID_SHIELD, SHGSI_ICONLOCATION, {var}sii);
    OleCheck(hr);

    HICON ico;
    hr = SHDefExtractIcon(sii.szPath, sii.iIcon, 0, ref ico, null, IconSize);
    OleCheck(hr);

    return ico;
}
</code></pre>

<p>It does the loading for you, and it handles the negative icon index (<a href=""https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100505-00/?p=14153"" rel=""noreferrer"">and the secret meaning that has</a>):</p>

<pre><code>HICON shieldIcon = GetStockIcon(SIID_SHIELD, 256);
</code></pre>

<p>Personally, i then use WIC to wrap that into a IWICBitmap:</p>

<pre><code>IWICBitmap GetStockWicBitmap(DWORD StockIconID, Integer IconSize)
{
   HICON ico = GetStockIcon(StockIconID, IconSize);

   IWICBitmap bitmap;
   IWICImagingFactory factory = new WICImagingFactory();
   HRESULT hr = factory.CreateBitmapFromHICON(ico, out bitmap);
   OleCheck(hr);

   return bitmap;
}
</code></pre>

<p>and so:</p>

<pre><code>IWICBitmap bmp = GetStockWicBitmap(SIID_SHIELD, 256);
</code></pre>

<p>Now that you have the bitmap, at runtime, do with it what you want.</p>

<h2>Small and Large</h2>

<p>The problem with <code>ExtractIconEx</code> is that you're again stuck with the two shell sizes:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>""small""</em> (i.e. <code>GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXSMICON)</code>)</li>
<li><em>""large""</em> (i.e. <code>GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXICON)</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Loading icons is something that is <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/35497503/12597"">quite a dark art in Windows</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>LoadIcon</li>
<li>LoadImage</li>
<li>LoadImage(..., LR_SHARED)</li>
<li>ExtractIcon</li>
<li>ExtractIconEx</li>
<li>IExtractImage</li>
<li>SHDefExtractIcon</li>
<li>SHGetFileInfo(..., SHGFI_ICON, ...);</li>
<li>SHGetFileInfo(..., SHGFI_SYSICONINDEX, ...);  </li>
<li>SHGetFileInfo(..., SHGFI_ICONLOCATION, ...);  </li>
<li>IThumbnailProvider</li>
</ul>

<h2>Icons available through SHGetStockIconInfo</h2>

<p>Microsoft gives a handy page that gives an example, and description, of all the stock icons.</p>

"2799646","<p>Here's the deal. I'm just starting with Java programming, I've made a simple application that uses SWT graphic library and I want to deploy it on a Mac (running the latest version of MacOS X).
I did all the programming in my Windows 7 machine, so here are my questions:</p>

<p><strong>Q1) Can I make an executable file for MacOS X from my Windows machine? How?</strong> (I saw that it's possible to create .exe files on Windows, instead of using .jar; I want to do the same for the Mac, of course it won't be an .exe)</p>

<p><strong>Q2)</strong> If I export my project in Eclipse and I choose <code>Runnable JAR File</code> and then on <code>Library Handling</code> I pick <code>Extract required libraries into generated JAR</code> or <code>Package required libraries into generated JAR</code> <strong>I end up with a huge .JAR (about 15MB of size, my application consist in just a button on a Window and a tiny method that doesn't do much). Is that considered normal?</strong>
Here's the list of libraries that my project appears to be using:</p>

<li>bundle all together like you are doing</li>
<li>bring other <strong>.jars</strong> together with yours without packing them</li>

<p>You only end up with uglier HTML (and non-crossbrowser compatible JS ;) ).</p>
<p>Again, if the UI look'n'feel isn't your biggest concern, but the functionality is, then just use <code>&lt;input type=&quot;search&quot;&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;&gt;</code>. It'll show the (browser-specific) clear button on HTML5 capable browsers.</p>

Just add a <code>UITextField</code>, with its <code>font</code> and <code>textColor</code> set to appropriate values, as subviews of the table cell's <code>contentView</code>. You probably want to give the field a <code>tag</code> as well, so that you can easily grab a reference to it using the <code>contentView</code>'s <code>-viewWithTag:</code> method.</p>

<p>With short forms you can get away with keeping an array of cells, one for each field, and handing them off to the table view without going through the <code>-dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:</code> mechanism, but if you've got a lot of stuff to enter then it gets more complicated. In that case, you probably want to assign a different reuse identifier to each type of cell—one for text-field cells, one for switch cells, one for slider cells, etc. Once you've dequeued or created the row's cell, you'd then grab its control from the content view (as above) and set its value from wherever you've stored that.</p>

"2805496","<p>I'm designing a city building game and got into a problem.</p>

<p>Imagine Sierra's <em>Caesar III</em> game mechanics: you have many city districts with one market each. There are several granaries over the distance connected with a directed weighted graph. The difference: people (here cars) are units that form traffic jams (here goes the graph weights).</p>

<p>Note: in Ceasar game series, people harvested food and stockpiled it in several big granaries, whereas many markets (small shops) took food from the granaries and delivered it to the citizens.</p>

<p><strong>The task</strong>: tell each district where they should be getting their food from while taking least time and minimizing congestions on the city's roads.</p>

<h2>Map example</h2>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/felv1.png"" alt=""Example graph diagram""></p>

<p>Suppose that yellow districts need 7, 7 and 4 apples accordingly.
Bluish granaries have 7 and 11 apples accordingly.</p>

<p>Suppose edges weights to be proportional to their length. Then, the solution should be something like the gray numbers indicated on the edges. Eg, first district gets 4 apples from the 1st and 3 apples from the 2nd granary, while the last district gets 4 apples from only the 2nd granary. </p>

<p>Here, vertical roads are first occupied to the max, and then the remaining workers are sent to the diagonal paths.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>What practical and very fast algorithm should I use? I was looking at some papers (<em>Congestion Games: Optimization in Competition</em> etc.) describing congestion games, but could not get the big picture.</p>

"2812494","<p>After spending a good 3 to 4 hours on google trying to find any solution to my problem I haven't had much luck. </p>

<p>Basically, we use crystal reports for our .NET applications with a sql server back end, we have many clients each with their own server and so our reports need to have their connections dynamically set. Up until a week ago this worked fine. However a few days ago a client reported they were getting a database login prompt for a report (only one report, the rest worked fine). We were quite stumped but we managed to reproduce it on a netbook which didn't have visual studio or sql server installed. In the end the dev decided to reproduce the report in the hope it was just an oddity in that particular report. </p>

<p>Unfortunately a new client today also experienced the same problem, but this time for every crystal report they had - and also they worked on the netbook, so we are really quite lost here.</p>

<p>Below is a screenshot of what our clients get presented with -</p>

<p>and here is the code that I use to set the connection information in the report</p>

<pre><code>                cI.ServerName = (string)builder[""Data Source""];
                cI.DatabaseName = (string)builder[""Initial Catalog""];
                cI.UserID = (string)builder[""User ID""];
                cI.Password = (string)builder[""Password""];

                foreach (IConnectionInfo info in cryRpt.DataSourceConnections)
                {
                    info.SetConnection(cI.ServerName, cI.DatabaseName, cI.UserID, cI.Password);
                }

"2820706","<p>I've got a SQL database that uses Guid's for PK's and upon insert, it generates a NewId().  I have an EF data context setup pointing to that database with the primary keys setup with the Entity key:true, Setter:private and StoreGeneratedPattern:Identity because I want the DB to manage the keys and not have code set the PK property. </p>

<p>I have another app that has a service reference to this service.  Upon trying to create a new object from this reference (i.e. Product), the ProductId Primary Key is being defaulted to Guid.Empty when doing</p>

<pre><code>var serviceEntities = new ServiceEntities(serviceUri); //OData endpoint

var product = new Product();
product.Name = ""New Product"";

serviceEntities.AddToProducts(product);
serviceEntities.SaveChanges(); // error happens here
</code></pre>

<p>When debugging, I look at the Product.ProductId property and it's set to Guid.Empty.  When called SaveChanges, I do not want the ProductId field to be sent to the service.  The response I get is: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Error processing request stream.
  Property 'ProductId' is a read-only
  property and cannot be updated. Please
  make sure that this property is not
  present in the request payload.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there a way to do this or what can I do to get this setup correctly and still have the DB generated the keys.</p>

You seem to be making a few confusions.

<p>I noticed the edits to your question. You want something that behaves like System Preference's date panel. Here's a breakdown of what I imagine is happening:</p>

<li>In the ""Time Elements* section, there are objects (models) that implement the pieces of data you can use in the text field (hours, minutes, seconds, etc.).</li>
<li>There is also an associated view for drawing these elements in the same style as the token (maybe taken from something in Cocoa, maybe a custom view).</li>
<li><code>NSTokenField</code> objects can accept arbitrary objects, as well as strings. So you can drag these objects from the ""Time Elements"" section onto the token field. The token field's delegate than handles these non-string objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>The guide linked above contains the information for handling non-string elements in token fields. I imagine all you need to do is create models for the data parts you want to represent, and then render them using a (possibly custom) view.</p>

"2835656","<p>I am trying to automate a third-party Win32 application where I want to capture the graphics content of a particular window at defined time intervals.  I am in the early phases of this, and I'm currently trying to use the <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/ms747327(v=vs.100)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Microsoft UI Automation</a> API via C# to do most of the interaction between my client app and the external app.  I can now get the external app to do what I want it to do, but now I want to capture the graphics from a specific window that seems to be some third-party owner-drawn control.  How can I do this?  The window I want to capture is the one marked by the red rectangle in this image:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/6gN2c.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/6gN2c.png"" alt=""I need what&#39;s in the red rectangle""></a>
</p>

<p>I have an implementation that sort of works, but it's dependent on the external app's UI being on top, and that's not guaranteed for me, so I'd prefer to find something more general.</p>

<pre><code>var p = Process.Start(""c:\myapp.exe"");
var mainForm = AutomationElement.FromHandle(p.MainWindowHandle);
// ""workspace"" below is the window whose content I want to capture.
var workspace = mainForm.FindFirst(TreeScope.Descendents,
                    new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.ClassNameProperty, ""AfxFrameOrView70u""));
var rect = (Rect) workspace.GetCurrentPropertyValue(AutomationElement.BoundingRectangleProperty);
using (var bmp = new Bitmap((int)rect.Width, (int)rect.Height))
{
    using (var g = Graphics.FromImage(bmp))
    {
        g.CopyFromScreen((int)rect.Left, (int)rect.Top, 0, 0, new Size((int)rect.Width, (int)rect.Height));
        bmp.Save(@""c:\screenshot.png"", ImageFormat.Png);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The above works well enough when the automated app is on top, but it just blindly copies the screen in the rectangle, so my code is at the mercy of whatever happens to be running on the machine and might cover my app's window.</p>

<p>I have read some suggestions to send the <code>WM_PRINT</code> message to the window. This <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1881317/c-sharp-windows-form-control-to-image/1881662#1881662"">question/answer</a> from a few months back seemed promising, but when I use this code, I just get a white rectangle with none of my control's actual contents.</p>

<pre><code>var prop = (int)workspace.GetCurrentPropertyValue(AutomationElement.NativeWindowHandleProperty);
var hwnd = new IntPtr(prop);
using ( var bmp2 = new Bitmap((int)rect.Width, (int)rect.Height))
{
    using (Graphics g = Graphics.FromImage(bmp2))
    {
        g.FillRectangle(SystemBrushes.Control, 0, 0, (int)rect.Width, (int)rect.Height);
        try
        {
            SendMessage(hwnd, WM_PRINT, g.GetHdc().ToInt32(), (int)(DrawingOptions.PRF_CHILDREN | DrawingOptions.PRF_CLIENT | DrawingOptions.PRF_OWNED));
        }
        finally
        {
            g.ReleaseHdc();
        }
        bmp2.Save(@""c:\screenshot.bmp"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So, first, is it even possible for me to reliably save a bitmap of a window's contents?  If so, what is the best way, and what is wrong with my <code>WM_PRINT</code> with <code>SendMessage</code> attempt?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since an element with opacity less than 1 is composited from a single
  offscreen image, content outside of it cannot be layered in z-order
  between pieces of content inside of it. For the same reason,
  implementations must create a new stacking context for any element
  with opacity less than 1. <strong>If an element with opacity less than 1 is
  not positioned, implementations must paint the layer it creates,
  within its parent stacking context, at the same stacking order that
  would be used if it were a positioned element with ‘z-index: 0’ and
  ‘opacity: 1’.</strong> If an element with opacity less than 1 is positioned,
  the ‘z-index’ property applies as described in [CSS21], except that
  ‘auto’ is treated as ‘0’ since a new stacking context is always
  created. See section 9.9 and Appendix E of [CSS21] for more
  information on stacking contexts. The rules in this paragraph do not
  apply to SVG elements, since SVG has its own rendering model ([SVG11],
  Chapter 3).</p>

Also, the number of fields can vary (one field per row on the form).

An example of the form is in the picture below - the callout on the right shows the id for each row.

However, I feel that there must be a much easier way to go about it - this method would likely involve a fair bit of string processing on each field, and there would possibly fall over if I have to add extra fields for each row later on.</p>

In that case, you know exactly what id string you should use to retrieve the value from FormCollection.</p>

<p>In case you really can't get the list of IDs you are going to update, just use the FormCollection iteration as you suggested in your comment. The string processing is not that expensive in comparation with all other stuff being done at request processing.</p>

<p>Further to the updated question, you may want to use the following in your PHP script:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) num_keys 
FROM   information_schema.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE     
WHERE  table_name ='tb' AND constraint_name = 'PRIMARY';

<p>This query will return <code>num_keys</code> > 1 if table <code>tb</code> has a composite primary key.</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm not sure if I understood what you are trying to achieve, but you may want to consider using <code>SHOW INDEX</code> as follows:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE tb (a int, b int, c int);

ALTER TABLE tb ADD CONSTRAINT pk_tb PRIMARY KEY (a, b);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.06 sec)

Here, instead of representing a point as (x,y) you represent it as (r, angle), where r is distance from origin and angle is the angle made with a chosen axis (which corresponds to angle 0).</p>
<p>In your case, if you set P(x,y) to be origin and one of the rays of the cone as angle = 0 and find polar co-ordinates of the end points of the line segment, say (r1, ang1) and (r2, ang2) then you need the following four conditions to be true for the line segment to be completely within (including boundary) of the cone.</p>
<pre><code>r1 &lt;= r
r2 &lt;= r

ang1 &lt;= theta
ang2 &lt;= theta
</code></pre>
<p>where r is the radius of the cone and theta is the angle of view and you chose the axis so that rotating counter-clockwise gives a corresponding positive angle.</p>
<p>Switching between polar and (x,y) (called rectangular) coordinates is easy, and you can find it on the wiki link I gave above.</p>
<p>In order to determine if <em>any</em> point of the line segment intersects the curve you can use the polar equation of a line give here: <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20171231210755/http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/formulas/faq.polar.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Link</a></p>
<p>We can use the Polar normal form</p>
<pre><code>R = p sec(ang - omega)
</code></pre>
<p>We can figure out p and omega given the two end-points of the line segment as follows:</p>
<p>We have</p>
<pre><code>p = r1 * cos(ang1-omega) = r2*cos(ang2-omega)
</code></pre>
<p>Using <code>cos(x-y) = cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)</code> we get</p>
<pre><code>[r1*cos(ang1) - r2*cos(ang2)] * cos(omega) =  [r2*sin(ang2) - r1*sin(ang1)] * sin(omega)
</code></pre>
<p>Thus you can calculate <code>tan(omega) = sin(omega)/cos(omega)</code> and use <code>arctan</code> (the inverse function of tan) to get the value of omega. Once you know what omega is, you can solve for p.</p>
<p>Now we need to know if there is some (R, ang) combination on this line such that</p>
<pre><code>R &lt;= r
0 &lt;= ang &lt;= theta
min{ang1, ang2} &lt;= ang &lt;= max{ang1, ang2}
</code></pre>
<p>(Note r was radius of cone, and theta was the angle of view, ang1 was angle of P1 and ang2 was angle of P2).</p>
<p>The equation can be rewritten as</p>
<pre><code>Rcos(ang-omega) = p
</code></pre>
<p>Now cos(ang-omega) is a very nicely behaved function in terms of monotonicity and you only need to consider it in the interval [min{ang1, ang2}, max{ang1, ang2}].</p>
<p>You should be able to do some manual manipulations first in order to simplify your code.</p>

","OpenGL ES - texture map all faces of an 8 vertex cube?","<android><opengl-es>","2010-05-18 02:32:21","7189","2854444","2","<p>You have to use 24 vertexes.  In OpenGL, a vertex is more than just position, it is the collection of all vertex attributes.  Every vertex array is accessed with the same index.</p>

<p>The infamous cube example is something almost everyone feels is inefficient when starting to use OpenGL, but in real-world, more complex models, the degree of duplication is quite low.</p>

<p>They seem to achieve real time softish shadows on the iphone which does not have a stencil buffer available. It seems to run pretty fluid here <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5OM6tPoxLU"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5OM6tPoxLU</a></p>
<p>Anyone has an idea?</p>
","Real time soft shadows without stencil buffers","<iphone><opengl-es>","2010-05-18 06:44:10","2421","2855340","2","<p>The stencil buffer allows hardware acceleration of shadows rendering, but isn't necessarily needed for displaying shadow volumes. With a low count of bodies and light sources, the software may emulate the behavior of the stencil buffer (but that will be very slow, compared to the hardware-accelerated implementation).</p>

<p>Also, there is other ways to display shadows. The most frequently used is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_mapping"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Shadow Mapping</a> (a more in-depth approach can be found <a href=""http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/smaliasing/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on GameDev.net</a>), which doesn't require a stencil buffer. It is used for PS2 games, as well as Wii games, because those hardware also doesn't have a stencil buffer.</p>

<p>And finally, under the circumstances of this particular game, the shadow algorithm can also be implemented as a simple ray tracing system, because there is no need for floor detection, and the shadows are basically calculated on 2D simple shapes (circles and squares). That might be the best approach for this particular case.</p>

"2855510","<p>I have a block generated by <a href=""https://www.drupal.org/project/finder"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Finder module</a> (simple search mechanism). The block contains a form with select lists of various taxonomy dictionaries.
Their order, however seems quite random (neither, alphabetical, nor chronological) and lists regions in such an order with no hierarchy:<br>

<p>I am trying my hand at making an invaders clone. there are 30 aliens arranged in a 5x 6 matrix on screen. I need to give the bottom most alien the ability to fire a shot.
I am using LINQ to group the aliens into 5 groups based on  Location.X and then sort the groups descending.I then need to choose one of the groups ( that gives me 5 groups)
and select the First alien in the group and use it;s coordinate to fire a shot.</p>

<p>My code below ,well ,works , but aliens in ANY row are merrily firing shots- not just the bottom most. Pl look at my code  below and tell me whats wrong.
(r = an instance of the Random class, all aliens are in a list called invaders).</p>

<pre><code> {
           var query = (from inv in invaders
                         group inv by inv.Location.X
                         into invgroup
                         orderby invgroup.Key descending 
                         select invgroup).ToList();

            var invfirst = query[r.Next(query.Count)].First();


                invaderShots.Add(new Shot(
                        new Point(invfirst.Area.X + invfirst.Area.Width / 2, invfirst.Area.Y + invfirst.Area.Height + 5),
                        displayrect, Shot.Direction.Down));

        }
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Solved.Now it works as required after David B pushed me in the right direction.</p>

<p>Final code below. 
May definitely need some improvements in light of the large number of grouping/sorting going on. If anyone has something constructive to say on this I am all ears ( or eyes , in this case). Thanks to all who helped.</p>

<pre><code>   List&lt;Invader&gt; firstinvader = invaders.GroupBy(inv =&gt; inv.Location.X)

            firstinvader.Sort(comparerByLocation);
            Invader item = firstinvader[firstinvader.Count -1];

            if(invaderShots.Count &lt; 2)

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>As mentioned in the comments, it can also be a good idea to store user dependent information in a database. This can allow for messages to be displayed to authenticated / known users.
My original answer was mostly targeted at anonymous users.</p>

<p>For authenticated users, you could have a message table, with a read / not read bit, or even a simply push table where you push messages and delete them from the table once the user has seen it.</p>

<p>You may require a 2 part system. One for the messages displayed to anonymous users. The second part would be for authenticated users about their personal profile/events related to them or the site.</p>

<p>The sluggishness comes from this part of the query:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>This part of the query matches a selection of days. For example, if the user wants to look at data between June 1st and July 1st over all the years for which there is data, the above clause matches against just those days. If the use wants to look at data between December 22nd and March 22nd, again for all the years for which there is data, the above clause calculates that March 22nd is in the following year of December 22nd, and so matches the date accordingly:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/nv4cP.png""/></p>

<p>Currently the dates are fixed as Jan 1 to Dec 31, but will be parameterized, as shown above.</p>

<p>The HashAggregate from the plan shows a cost of 10006220141.11, which is, I suspect, on the astronomically huge side.</p>

<p>There is a full table scan on the measurement table (itself having neither data nor indexes) being performed. The table aggregates 273 million rows from its child tables.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong></p>

<p>What is the proper way to index the dates to avoid full table scans?</p>

<p>Options I have considered:</p>

<ul>
<li>GIN</li>
<li>GiST</li>
<li>Rewrite the WHERE clause</li>
<li>Separate year_taken, month_taken, and day_taken columns to the tables</li>
</ul>

<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

"2871726","<p>I have single-thread windows form application written with <strong>VB.NET</strong> and targeting <strong>Framework 1.1</strong>. The software communicates with external boards through a serial interface, and it mainly consist of a <strong>state machine</strong> that run some tests, driven in a loop done with a Timer and an Interval of 50ms.</p>

<p>The feedback on the user interface is done through some custom events raised during the tests.</p>

<p>The problem that is driving me crazy is that the performance slightly decrease over time, and in particular after 1200/1300 test operations. The memory occupied does not increase over time, it is only the CPU that seems interested by this problem.</p>

<p>The strange thing is that, targeting framework 2.0 and using the same identical code, I do not have this problem.</p>

<p>I know that is difficult without looking at the code, but do you have suggestions how can I approach the problem?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I am really lost, after a couple of intensive work the application starts slowing down. The selected row is related to its process, if it could help.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong>: Using the Windows Task Manager I detected that the Handles counter is <strong>increased by 1</strong> at the end of each operation. I don't know if it is the cause but the application starts to slow down when the handles counter reaches about 1500 handles. I checked that all necessary <strong>RemoveHandler</strong> are called after each operation. Any idea?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT3</strong>: I found that the <strong>handles problem is generated by the C++ library</strong> we are using to communicated with the serial device. It then happens both in .NET 1.1 and .NET 2.0. The difference, and that's strange, is that if the target .NET 1.1 the application slow down/freeze instead for .NET 2.0 I reached more than 30000 handles without loosing performances. Now I don't know if the problem is really caused by this lost handles, I will try to ask to the developers of C++ library to correct the problem and see if it solves the problem I am having on .NET 1.1.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It's the dumb/obvious question. Are you <em>absoutely</em> sure you're Disposing everything that implements IDispose?<br />
Even if you are sure go back and check again, keep an eye out for temporary objects that won't be disposed e.g.</p>
<pre><code>string s = objA.GetAThing().ToString()
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>where GetAThing() returns an object that implements IDispose.</p>

<li>Have you tried forcing a Garbage Collection?<br />

We have a large rich .Net winforms application that on which we <em>need</em> to force a collection every ten minutes or so. If we don't the the application starts to grind after a couple of hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope this helps :)</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong><br />
Thats a shame. Do you have the C++ source? Or are you stuck with this problem?</p>
<p>If stuck, you can have the application periodically launch a new instance while terminating the current instance.</p>
<p>You can use a locked file or Mutex to ensure the new instance doesn't start processing until the first terminates.</p>

<p>Turn Off The Error Dialog Via The Registry</p>
<p>Although editing the registry manually is not recommended for average users, sometimes there isn’t a choice because something like the Group policy Editor might not be available in your version of Windows or the group policy method itself doesn’t work. This works on Windows Vista and above.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Open the Registry Editor by typing regedit into the Start search box or the Win+R Run dialog.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Navigate to the following registry key:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>Double click the DontShowUI entry on the right and change its value to 1, then close the registry editor.</li>
</ol>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>The above registry fix will turn off the popup dialog for the current user, if you want the setting to affect all users on the computer then a similar registry key needs to be created in the registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. This key isn’t present by default so needs to be created.</p>

"2877724","<p><strong>Rush Hour</strong><br>
if you're not familiar with it, the game consists of a collection of cars of varying sizes, set either horizontally or vertically, on a NxM grid that has a single exit.<br>
Each car can move forward/backward in the directions it's set in, as long as another car is not blocking it. You can <strong>never</strong> change the direction of a car.<br>
There is one special car, usually it's the red one. It's set in the same row that the exit is in, and the objective of the game is to find a series of moves (a move - moving a car N steps back or forward) that will allow the red car to drive out of the maze.  </p>

<p>I've been trying to think how to solve this problem computationally, and I can really not think of any good solution.<br>
I came up with a few:</p>

<ol>
<li>Backtracking. This is pretty simple - Recursion and some more recursion until you find the answer. However, each car can be moved a few different ways, and in each game state a few cars can be moved, and the resulting game tree will be HUGE.</li>
<li>Some sort of constraint algorithm that will take into account what needs to be moved, and work recursively somehow. This is a very rough idea, but it is an idea.</li>
<li>Graphs? Model the game states as a graph and apply some sort of variation on a coloring algorithm, to resolve dependencies? Again, this is a very rough idea.  </li>
<li>A friend suggested genetic algorithms. This is sort of possible but not easily. I can't think of a good way to make an evaluation function, and without that we've got nothing.</li>
</ol>

<p>So the question is - How to create a program that takes a grid and the vehicle layout, and outputs a series of steps needed to get the red car out?  </p>

<p>Sub-issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>Finding <strong>some</strong> solution.</li>
<li>Finding an <strong>optimal</strong> solution (minimal number of moves)</li>
<li>Evaluating how good a current state is</li>
</ol>

<p>Example: How can you move the cars in this setting, so that the red car can ""exit"" the maze through the exit on the right?<br>

<p>There are two note-worthy lines in the source code:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>break;</code> when a solution is found

<ul>
<li>This is now commented so that the breadth first search explores the <em>entire</em> search space, to confirm the numbers given in the linked website above</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The <code>current = sb.toString();</code> in <code>slide</code>

<ul>
<li>Essentially this counts each movement of any car as one move. If a car is moved 3 spaces to the left, that's 3 moves. To combo this as one move (since it involves the same car moving in the same direction), simply comment this line. The linked website does not acknowledge combo, so this line is now uncommented to match the minimum number of moves given. With combo-counting, the 93-moves problem only requires 49 combo moves. That is, if there's a parking attendant in the lot that moves these cars around, he'd only only need to go in and out of a car 49 times.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Overview of the algorithm</h3>

<p>The algorithm is essentially a breadth first search, implemented with a queue as is typical. A predecessor map is maintained so that any state can be traced back to the initial state. A key will never be remapped, and as entries are inserted in breadth-first search order, shortest path is guaranteed.</p>

<p>A state is represented as an <code>NxM</code>-length <code>String</code>. Each <code>char</code> represents an entity on the board, stored in row-major order.</p>

<p>Neighboring states are found by scanning all 4 directions from an empty space, looking for an appropriate car type, sliding it as room accommodates.</p>

<p>There is plenty of redundant work here (e.g. long ""alleys"" are scanned multiple times), but as mentioned before, although the generalized version is PSPACE-complete, the classic Rush Hour variant is very tractable by brute force.</p>

It looks like the CSG operation is done without interpolation. It just ""discards"" the whole triangle. Do I need to interpolate in some other way, or combine the vertex scalar values? I'd love some help with this.

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Basically, my implementation of <em>marching squares</em> works fine. It is my <em>scalar field</em> which is broken, and I wonder what the correct way would look like.

<p>Let's say we've already used filters and an edge detection algorithm in this pic. Now my goal is to measure distances (NOT actual distances, distance can be in any arbitrary unit) . 
eg: How do I find the length of the hall? (until the window)</p>

<p>Or the height of the bookshelves? How exactly do you place the ""scale"" and measure. I'm looking for ideas. However it would help if the answers were in terms of OpenCV.</p>
","How do I measure distances in an image?","<image-processing><opencv><photogrammetry>","2010-05-21 16:41:42","6986","2883982","2","<p>It depends on what you're trying to do. </p>

<p>You mention you want to measure the height of the bookshelves. If its OK with you to consider the close area of the bookshelf ""shorter"" than the height of the end of the bookshelf at the end of the row, all you're looking for is to measure distance. Choose a unit of ""pixels"" and then measure the distance using the Pythagorean theorem.  (x^2+y^2 = z^2)</p>

<p>What you're probably really looking for is to have the height of the near bookcase be the same as the height of the far bookcase. In that case, you have to have more information.  You have to do a 2D -> 3D transformation: You have a 2D image and you need to reconstruct a 3D picture from that image. At that point, you need a 3rd piece of information, since you want 3 variables (X, y, z) from 2 variables. </p>

<p>You can definitely do this with OpenCV if you properly calibrate the system and have a second reference point (for example, a laser line).

"2885391","<p>I'm making a <code>DataGridView</code> with a series of Checkboxes in it with the same labels horizontally and vertically.  Any labels that are the same, the checkboxes will be inactive, and I only want one of the two ""checks"" for each combination to be valid.  The following screenshot shows what I have:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/6NeBv.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/6NeBv.png"" alt=""DataGridView""></a>
</p>

<p>Anything that's checked on the lower half, I want UN-checked on the upper.  So if [quux, spam] (or [7, 8] for zero-based co-ordinates) is checked, I want [spam, quux] ([8, 7]) un-checked.  What I have so far is the following:</p>

<pre><code>    dgvSysGrid.RowHeadersWidthSizeMode = DataGridViewRowHeadersWidthSizeMode.AutoSizeToAllHeaders;
    dgvSysGrid.AutoSizeColumnsMode = DataGridViewAutoSizeColumnsMode.AllCells;
    string[] allsysNames = { ""heya"", ""there"", ""lots"", ""of"", ""names"", ""foo"", ""bar"", ""quux"", ""spam"", ""eggs"", ""bacon"" };

    // Add a column for each entry, and a row for each entry, and mark the ""diagonals"" as readonly
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; allsysNames.Length; i++)
    {
        dgvSysGrid.Columns.Add(new DataGridViewCheckBoxColumn(false));
        dgvSysGrid.Columns[i].HeaderText = allsysNames[i];
        dgvSysGrid.Rows.Add();
        dgvSysGrid.Rows[i].HeaderCell.Value = allsysNames[i];
        // Mark all of the ""diagonals"" as unable to change
        DataGridViewCell curDiagonal = dgvSysGrid[i, i];
        curDiagonal.ReadOnly = true;
        curDiagonal.Style.BackColor = Color.Black;
        curDiagonal.Style.ForeColor = Color.Black;
    }

    // Hook up the event handler so that we can change the ""corresponding"" checkboxes as needed
    //dgvSysGrid.CurrentCellDirtyStateChanged += new EventHandler(dgvSysGrid_CurrentCellDirtyStateChanged);
    dgvSysGrid.CellValueChanged += new DataGridViewCellEventHandler(dgvSysGrid_CellValueChanged);

}

void dgvSysGrid_CellValueChanged(object sender, DataGridViewCellEventArgs e)
{
    Point cur = new Point(e.ColumnIndex, e.RowIndex);

    // Change the diagonal checkbox to the opposite state
    DataGridViewCheckBoxCell curCell = (DataGridViewCheckBoxCell)dgvSysGrid[cur.X, cur.Y];
    DataGridViewCheckBoxCell diagCell = (DataGridViewCheckBoxCell)dgvSysGrid[cur.Y, cur.X];
    if ((bool)(curCell.Value) == true)
    {
        diagCell.Value = false;
    }
    else
    {
        diagCell.Value = true;
    }
}

/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// Change the corresponding checkbox to the opposite state of the current one
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
/// &lt;param name=""sender""&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
/// &lt;param name=""e""&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
void dgvSysGrid_CurrentCellDirtyStateChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    Point cur = dgvSysGrid.CurrentCellAddress;

    // Change the diagonal checkbox to the opposite state
    DataGridViewCheckBoxCell curCell = (DataGridViewCheckBoxCell)dgvSysGrid[cur.X, cur.Y];
    DataGridViewCheckBoxCell diagCell = (DataGridViewCheckBoxCell)dgvSysGrid[cur.Y, cur.X];
    if ((bool)(curCell.Value) == true)
    {
        diagCell.Value = false;
    }
    else
    {
        diagCell.Value = true;
    }
} 
</code></pre>

<p>The problem comes is that the cell value changed always seems to be ""one behind"" where you actually click if I use the <code>CellValueChanged</code> event, and I'm not sure how to get the current cell if I'm in the ""dirty"" state as curCell comes in as a null (suggesting the current cell address is wrong somehow, but I didn't try and get that value out) meaning that path isn't working at all.</p>

<p>Basically, how do I get the ""right"" address with the right boolean value so that my flipping algorithm will work?</p>
","DataGridView CheckBox events","<c#><datagridview><checkbox>","2010-05-21 20:37:11","23014","2906724","3","<p>Ultimately, it was the <code>CurrentCellDirtyStateChanged</code> event that does it, but you need to do it in the right way.  And the right way is <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.datagridview.currentcelldirtystatechanged.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">MSDN</a>'s, though it doesn't make sense at first glance.</p>

<p>A fragment from above, and what I ultimately did is below:</p>

<pre><code>    // Hook up the event handler so that we can change the ""corresponding"" checkboxes as needed
    dgvSysGrid.CurrentCellDirtyStateChanged += new EventHandler(dgvSysGrid_CurrentCellDirtyStateChanged);
    dgvSysGrid.CellValueChanged += new DataGridViewCellEventHandler(dgvSysGrid_CellValueChanged);

}

void dgvSysGrid_CellValueChanged(object sender, DataGridViewCellEventArgs e)
{
    Point cur = new Point(e.ColumnIndex, e.RowIndex);

    // Change the diagonal checkbox to the opposite state
    DataGridViewCheckBoxCell curCell = (DataGridViewCheckBoxCell)dgvSysGrid[cur.X, cur.Y];
    DataGridViewCheckBoxCell diagCell = (DataGridViewCheckBoxCell)dgvSysGrid[cur.Y, cur.X];
    if ((bool)(curCell.Value) == true)
    {
        diagCell.Value = false;
    }
    else
    {
        diagCell.Value = true;
    }
}

void dgvSysGrid_CurrentCellDirtyStateChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (dgvSysGrid.IsCurrentCellDirty)
    {
        dgvSysGrid.CommitEdit(DataGridViewDataErrorContexts.Commit);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, all that's happening is the <code>CurrentCellDirtyStateChanged</code> event triggers the <code>CellValueChanged</code> event, and that's it.  If you just attach the <code>CellValueChanged</code> event, then it only triggers AFTER you have left the cell.  I don't know why exactly (considering it's a checkbox, isn't it ""done"" immediately?), but that's what happens.  And the code as above works, in that the check box changes go in RIGHT away when clicking it.  So it works.</p>

<ol>
<li>I attached a a4j:support object that, onclick, makes the overlay disappear. The problem with this is that when I click the upload button on the upload component, support catches the click event and closes the overlay with the upload component before I have the chance to finish the operation.</li>
<li>I chose two different style classes. One for the overlay and one for the upload panel. But the styling of the overlay takes over the upload component and it becomes transparent as well.</li>
</ol>

<p>The implementation looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;h:panelgroup layout=""block"" styleClass=""overlayClass""&gt;
  &lt;rich:fileUpload styleClass=""uploadStyleClass""... /&gt;
  &lt;a4j:support event=""onclick"" action=""#{mrBean.switchOverlayState}"" reRender=""...""/&gt;
&lt;/h:panelGroup&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The CSS:</p>

<pre><code>.overlayClass {
        Opacity: 0.5;
    position: fixed;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    top: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    background: #000;
}

.uploadStyleClass {
         opacity: 1.0;
         ...
}

<p>the result should be an image with the msn content without the white margins(left&amp; right).</p>

<p>I search on the X axis for the first and last color change and on the Y axis the same thing. The problem is that traversing the image line by line takes a while..for an image that is 2000x1600px it takes up to 2 seconds to return the CropRect => x1,y1,x2,y2 data.</p>

<p>I tried to make for each coordinate a traversal and stop on the first value found but it didn't work in all test cases..sometimes the returned data wasn't the expected one and the duration of the operations was similar..</p>

<p>Any idea how to cut down the traversal time and discovery of the rectangle round the 'main content'?</p>

","How to determine edges in an image optimally?","<c#><image><edge-detection>","2010-05-24 15:22:24","2897","2898097","3","<p>One possible optimisation is to use <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.drawing.bitmap.lockbits.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lockbits</a> to access the color values directly rather than through the much slower GetPixel.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20141229164101/http://bobpowell.net/lockingbits.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bob Powell page on LockBits</a> is a good reference.</p>
<p>On the other hand, my testing has shown that the overhead associated with Lockbits makes that approach slower if you try to write a GetPixelFast equivalent to GetPixel and drop it in as a replacement.  Instead you need to ensure that all pixel access is done in one hit rather than multiple hits.  This should fit nicely with your code provided you don't lock/unlock on every pixel.</p>
<p>Here is an example</p>
<pre><code>BitmapData bmd = b.LockBits(new Rectangle(0, 0, b.Width, b.Height), System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageLockMode.ReadOnly, b.PixelFormat);

byte* row = (byte*)bmd.Scan0 + (y * bmd.Stride);

//                           Blue                    Green                   Red 
Color c = Color.FromArgb(row[x * pixelSize + 2], row[x * pixelSize + 1], row[x * pixelSize]);

b.UnlockBits(bmd);
</code></pre>
<p>Two more things to note:</p>
<ol>
<li>This code is unsafe because it uses pointers</li>
<li>This approach depends on pixel size within Bitmap data, so you will need to derive pixelSize from bitmap.PixelFormat</li>

<p>Instead of WriteLining to the screen, you're writing text to a window or setting the text of some control.  The library keeps track of windows, overlap, border effects, drop shadows, drag behavior (if the mouse is supported).

<p>The goto(x, y) example posted would work, but if the implementation did this for each character, the performance would lag noticeably.  To get the quickness, when you make a change to some text or other properties, the library knows the rectangular regions that need to be updated from the character buffer and writes the new character data for that region to the screen in one chunk with optimized calls to the video drivers.</p>

<p>Unlike with basic console apps which just echo every printable character to the screen, keyboard input in these advanced apps is intercepted and such characters are more explicitly written to (or not written to, in the case of your app's hotkeys) the right window or whatever.</p>

<p>In my controller class I reference this data context called <code>Model</code> (as you can see on the right side of picture in properties) like this:</p>

<pre><code>private Model model = new Model();
</code></pre>

<p>I've got a table (List) of Series rendered on my page. It renders properly and I was able to add delete functionality to delete Series like this:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Delete(int id) {
    model.Series.DeleteOnSubmit(model.Series.SingleOrDefault(s =&gt; s.ID == id));
    model.SubmitChanges();
    return RedirectToAction(""Index"");
}

<p>Where appropriate action link looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%: Html.ActionLink(""Delete"", ""Delete"", new { id=item.ID })%&gt;

<p>Also create (implemented in similar way) works fine. However edit does not work. My edit looks like this: </p>

If I add this line: <code>model.Series.Attach(series);</code> just before <code>model.SubmitChanges();</code> there is no change - edits still does not reflect to database. The instance passed to Edit method as a parameter is already attached to the data context <code>model</code>.</p>

<p>By giving the top block a height of <code>0pt</code> we allow for the next <code>minipage</code> to overlap it.</p>

<li>Use a normal HTML request ( not Asynchronous/Ajax request ) to submit the form.</li>
<li>Because the target frame is iframe , the whole page will not be refreshed - just the iframe.</li>
<li>Once iframe <strong>onload</strong> event happens (capture that event using Javascript) then do what you want, e.g. You can send back a request to list recent uploaded file info.</li>

"2910017","<p>We have a situation at work where developers working on a legacy (core) system are being pressured into using GOTO statements when adding new features into existing code that is already infected with spaghetti code.</p>

<p>Now, I understand there may be arguments for using 'just one little GOTO' instead of spending the time on refactoring to a more maintainable solution. The issue is, this isolated 'just one little GOTO' isn't so isolated. At least once every week or so there is a new 'one little GOTO' to add. This codebase is already a horror to work with due to code dating back to or before 1984 being riddled with GOTOs that would make many <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastafarian"" rel=""noreferrer"">Pastafarians</a> believe it was inspired by the Flying Spaghetti Monster itself.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the language this is written in doesn't have any ready made refactoring tools, so it makes it harder to push the 'Refactor to increase productivity later' because short-term wins are the only wins paid attention to here...</p>

<p>Has anyone else experienced this issue whereby everybody agrees that we cannot be adding new GOTOs to jump 2000 lines to a random section, but continually have Anaylsts insist on doing it just this one time and having management approve it?</p>

<p><strong>tldr;</strong></p>

<p>How can one go about addressing the issue of developers being pressured (forced) to continually add GOTO statements (by add, I mean add to jump to random sections many lines away) because it 'gets <em>that</em> feature in quicker'?</p>

<p>I'm beginning to fear we may lose valuable developers to the raptors over this...</p>

"2910130","<p>I followed Apple's instructions on how to create an Ad Hoc Distrubution bundle but I keep getting what appears to be a fatal Warning during the build process.

<p>Why they are using has_one:through here. We can do the same with has_one only. What's the need of making a new class. Can you give me any good example?</p>

<p>Here is the link for the original example 
<a href=""https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">from Rails guide</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>We can do the same thing in this way what's the use of making it a has_one:through</p>

<pre><code>  class Supplier &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
     has_one :account  
  end

  class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base 
    belongs_to :supplier    // add a another column credit_rating in accounts table
  end
</code></pre>
","What's the use of has_one :through here (example from Rails guide)","<ruby-on-rails><associations>","2010-05-26 10:25:18","2279","2912707","4","<p>There are cases where you might not want to add a specific field to a table. In your example you really only need one table as you can just add <code>account_number</code> and <code>credit_ranking</code> to the <code>suppliers</code> table. But sometimes it's a good idea to store the data across several tables. Then you have to use the <code>has_one</code> (one-to-one) relationship.</p>

<p>In your example you could also just add the attribute <code>supplier_id</code> to <code>account_histories</code> and replace <code>has_one :account_history, :through account</code> with just <code>has_one :account_history</code> but that would be redundant and also complicate your code as you would need to make sure that you don't change one attribute and forget to update the other one.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>If you don't add the <code>supplier_id</code> attribute to <code>account_histories</code> then Rails won't be able to determine which row from that table belongs to which supplier. The only way to find that out is to look in the related <code>accounts</code> table. Without <code>accounts</code> you can't determine which <code>account_history</code> belongs to a supplier as the <code>accounts_histories</code> table doesn't have any foreign keys for the <code>suppliers</code> table.</p>

<p>To get the <code>account_history</code> for a supplier without the <code>:through</code> option you would have to do this:</p>

<pre><code>Supplier.find(id).account.account_history
</code></pre>

<p><code>:through</code> allows you to replace it with this:</p>

<pre><code>Supplier.find(id).account_history
</code></pre>

<p>As you've written in your update you could add the <code>credit_ranking</code> attribute to <code>accounts</code> and have only two tables. That would be even more simple but you just might want not to store that attribute in the same table (because maybe you already have lots of other attributes and don't want to add even more of them).</p>

<p>In the type library editor, add ""Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.1 Library"" to the list of used libraries. This will generate <code>ADODB_TLB.pas</code> unit in your project directory.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/0Fq9h.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/0Fq9h.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>Then you can declare a new read-only property <code>Connection</code> of type <code>Connection</code> (this type is declared in <code>ADODB_TLB</code> unit) in your <code>IActiveFormX</code> interface.</p>

</p>

<p>In the implementation, you can simply return the interface from your <code>TADOConnection</code> component:</p>

<pre><code>type
  THackADOConnection = class(TADOConnection);

function TActiveFormX.Get_Connection: Connection;
begin
  Result := Connection(THackADOConnection(ADOConnection).ConnectionObject);
end;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>THackADOConnection</code> typecast is only necessary because <code>ConnectionObject</code> is protected. The outer <code>Connection</code> typecast is there to get rid of the compiler error ""Incompatible types: ADODB_TLB._Connection and ADOInt._Connection.""</p>

"2919487","<p>I've created a test suite in NUnit that references several distinct unit test fixtures in various assemblies.</p>

<p>I've pretty much used the example code from <a href=""http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=suite&amp;r=2.4.7"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NUnit's docs</a>:</p>

<pre><code>namespace NUnit.Tests
{

    using System.Collections;

    public class AllTests
    {
        [Suite]
        public static IEnumerable Suite
        {
            get
            {
                ArrayList suite = new ArrayList();
                suite.Add(new VisionMap.DotNet.Tests.ManagedInteropTest.DotNetUtilsTest());
                return suite;
            }
        }

<p>My goal is to add several tests to the list above so I can run them all in a batch.</p>

<p>But when I try to load the DLL in NUnit's GUI I get this:
<img src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/132375/Pics/CropperCapture%5B22%5D.Png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>

<p>I'm aware that the docs say the GUI won't run suites, but I've tried the console as well. Can somebody please tell me what Suites are good for and how I can use them to achieve my goal?</p>

<p>I'm using nunit 2.5.0.9122.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Well, no answers are forthcoming. I found an alternative solution in the end: Categories. I group test fixtures by giving them appropriate categories and then I can run a subset of them in batch, while still ignoring another subset.</p>

<p>Still, very odd that this Suite feature seems to be completely broken.</p>
","NUnit not running Suite tests","<c#><unit-testing><testing><nunit>","2010-05-27 08:19:24","6295","3528392","2","<p>Suites aren't really needed for anything much at all these days. If you only wanted to use them to specify which tests do and don't get run this is much better achieved with Category attributes. This is what you ended up doing, and sounds like the best solution to your problem.</p>

<p>However, for others' and future reference, you <strong>can</strong> still use Suites in Nunit. You have to run them from the console, and only using the /fixture option. For example, to run the suite you specified above, you'd run (assuming your class was compiled into an assembly AllTests.dll):</p>

<pre><code>nunit-console /fixture:AllTests.Suite AllTests.dll

<p>You won't see any evidence of or way to run suites in the GUI - this is noted in the documentation. You can however run them from the console that is built into the GUI using commands like the above.</p>

"2919996","<p>My website contains drop-down menus at the top right corner of the screen. The drop-down  is displayed fine, but when I hover over elements within the drop-down, IE renders them incorrecty. Firefox, however, displays them the way I want.
The website is <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20100920190736/http://textsensor.com:80/test/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.textsensor.com/test</a>. Can anybody tell me what is causing the issue in IE?</p>

<p>Here are the details. Each parent at top has a child <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> which contains child elements in a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>. I am displaying them inline with width of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> container fixed, so that two of them are being displayed in one line. Each child <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> contains two images and an anchor in between. These two images are providing rounded corners, whereas the anchor contains a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, which in turn contains the text of the sub-menu item. When the mouse moves over the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, I am showing its parent anchor sibling images through javascript, and also setting its bg-image to white. Images are not aligned correctly and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> tag got down about 10px from top on IE only. The jQuery used is listed below:</p>

<pre><code>   $(""#jsddm li ul li a span"").hover(function(){
        $(this).parent().siblings(""img"").css(""visibility"", 'visible');
        $(this).parent().css(""border-bottom"", ""#a00 5px double"");
    }, function(){
        $(this).parent().siblings(""img"").css(""visibility"", 'hidden');
        $(this).parent().css(""border-bottom"", ""none"");
    });
</code></pre>

<p>Html of one menu item is:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;img src='images/submenuImg1.png' class='leftsubImg'&gt;
&lt;a href=""pricerates.php""&gt;&lt;span&gt;Price Rates&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;img src='images/submenuImg3.png' class='rightsubImg'&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>When I mouseover span leftsubImg, rightsubImg will be visile and also bg of span is set to be an image repeating in x. Issue that is causing trouble is that span is having margin of about 12px from top and it is about 5px below images on its left and right. </p>

"2920948","<p>I'm having some fun trying to pick a decent SQL Server 2008 spatial index setup for a data set I am dealing with.</p>

<p>The dataset is polygons, representing contours over the whole globe. There are 106,000 rows in the table, the polygons are stored in a geometry field.</p>

<p>The issue I have is that many of the polygons cover a large portion of the globe. This seems to make it very hard to get a spatial index that will eliminate many rows in the primary filter. For example, look at the following query: </p>

<pre><code>SELECT ""ID"",""CODE"",""geom"".STAsBinary() as ""geom"" FROM ""dbo"".""ContA""
WHERE ""geom"".Filter(
  geometry::STGeomFromText('POLYGON ((-142.03193662573682 59.53396984952896,
    -142.03193662573682 59.88928136451884,
    -141.32743833481925 59.88928136451884,
    -141.32743833481925 59.53396984952896,
    -142.03193662573682 59.53396984952896))', 4326)
) = 1
</code></pre>

<p>This is querying an area which intersects with only two of the polygons in the table. No matter what combination of spatial index settings I chose, that Filter() always returns around 60,000 rows.</p>

<p>Replacing Filter() with STIntersects() of course returns just the two polygons I want, but of course takes much longer (Filter() is 6 seconds, STIntersects() is 12 seconds).</p>

<p>Can anyone give me any hints on whether there is a spatial index setup that is likely to improve on 60,000 rows or is my dataset just not a good match for SQL Server's spatial indexing ?</p>

<p><strong>More info:</strong></p>

<p>As suggested, I split the polygons up, using a 4x4 grid across the globe. I couldn't see a way to do it with QGIS, so I wrote my own query to do it. First I defined 16 bounding boxes, the first looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>declare  @box1 geometry = geometry::STGeomFromText('POLYGON ((
-180 90,
-90 90,
-90 45,
-180 45,
-180 90))', 4326)
</code></pre>

<p>Then I used each bounding box to select and truncate the polygons that intersected that box:</p>

<pre><code>insert ContASplit
select CODE, geom.STIntersection(@box1), CODE_DESC from ContA
where geom.STIntersects(@box1) = 1
</code></pre>

<p>I obviously did this for all 16 bounding boxes in the 4x4 grid. The end result is that I have a new table with ~107,000 rows (which confirms that I didn't actually have many huge polygons).</p>

<p>I added a spatial index with 1024 cells per object and low,low,low,low for the cells per level.</p>

<p>However, very oddly this new table with the split polygons still performs the same as the old one. Doing the .Filter listed above <em>still</em> returns ~60,000 rows. I really don't understand this at all, clearly I don't understand how the spatial index actually work.</p>

<p>Paradoxically, while .Filter() still returns ~60,000 rows, it has improved performance. The .Filter() now takes around 2 seconds rather than 6 and the .STIntersects() now takes 6 seconds rather than 12.</p>

<p>As requested here is an example of the SQL for the index:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE SPATIAL INDEX [contasplit_sidx] ON [dbo].[ContASplit] 
(
    [geom]
)USING  GEOMETRY_GRID 
WITH (
BOUNDING_BOX =(-90, -180, 90, 180),
GRIDS =(LEVEL_1 = LOW,LEVEL_2 = LOW,LEVEL_3 = LOW,LEVEL_4 = LOW), 
CELLS_PER_OBJECT = 1024,
PAD_INDEX  = OFF,
SORT_IN_TEMPDB = OFF,
DROP_EXISTING = OFF,
ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS  = ON,
ALLOW_PAGE_LOCKS  = ON) ON [PRIMARY]
</code></pre>

<p>Though remember, I have tried a whole range of different settings for the grids and cells per object, with the same results each time.</p>

<p>Here are the results of running sp_help_spatial_geometry_index, this is on my split dataset where no single polygon occupies more than 1/16th of the globe:</p>

<p><strong>Further research:</strong></p>

<p>I continue to be puzzled by the poor performance of the primary filter with this data. So I did a test to see exactly how my data splits up.  With my original unsplit features I added a ""cells"" column to the table. I then ran 16 queries to count how many cells in a 4x4 grid the feature spanned. So I ran a query like this for each cell:</p>

<pre><code>declare  @box1 geometry = geometry::STGeomFromText('POLYGON ((
-180 90,
-90 90,
-90 45,
-180 45,
-180 90))', 4326)
update ContA set cells = cells + 1 where
geom.STIntersects(@box1) = 1
</code></pre>

<p>If I then look at the ""cells"" column in the table there are only 672 features in the whole of my data set that intersect with more than 1 cell within the 4x4 grid. So how on Earth, quite literally, can the primary filter be returning 60,000 features for a query looking at a small 200 mile wide rectangle ?</p>

<p>At this point it looks like I could write my own indexing scheme that would work better that how SQL Server's is performing for these features.</p>

<p>Did i said that im very bad at Css? </p>

<p>My css looks like this </p>

<pre><code>#footer-navi

    padding-bottom:1.5em;
}

{
    display:block;

{
    margin:0 auto;
}

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  Here is some html</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""footer-group""&gt;

"2921978","<p>In short my scenario is like so:<br>
<img src=""https://i612.photobucket.com/albums/tt209/fredrikmork/aspnet_wcf_wcf.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<ol>
<li>The user triggers an action in the web browser, which causes an Ajax call to a web service in the web server (<em>server A</em>).</li>
<li>The web server issues a call to a WCF service, hosted in IIS (<em>server B</em>)</li>
<li>The WCF service issues a call to another WCF service, hosted in IIS (<em>server C</em>)</li>
</ol>

<p>All web sites are exposed over http, not https.</p>

<p>Now, server C needs to know who the user is in the other end. I got it working so far so that the WCF service call to server B is performed under impersonation, so server B has a <code>WindowsIdentity</code> object representing the user. However, when I try to invoke the service call from server B to server C under impersonation, I get the following back:</p>

<p>As the bottom left corner shows, this is doing sum <code>0+1</code> and the result is <code>01b</code> (bottom right hand side).</p>

<p>I am not able to link what is displayed to what the inputs ans outputs are. For example in this case - seeing the snapshot, how do you determine that the inputs are <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> and the output is <code>01</code>?</p>
","How to work with this turing machine?","<language-agnostic><boolean-logic><turing-complete><cellular-automata>","2010-05-27 18:08:16","317","2924443","1","<p>From <a href=""http://www.rennard.org/alife/english/logicellgb.html#LCellFcnmt&quot;"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An eater manages the output. The red displayed cell only is activated if an eater absorbs a glider. This cell is the output.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/KFT9z.gif"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Yet do note that this is a transient situation you have to be measuring for, with a certain periodicity.  If you keep running the automata after that square is set, the eater is designed to return to its original form.  From the PDF:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To design efficient circuits we need to somehow stop a stream of gliders to prevent the gliders from ""polluting"" the computational space. There are compact stable patterns, called eaters that consume gliders and then recovery back to their original form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since we have two bits of output (MSB and LSB) I've highlighted their ""eaters""/outputs:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/1Z2BC.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>The addition is defined according to boolean operations:</p>

<pre><code>A B | A+B
---------
0 0 | 0 0
1 0 | 0 1
0 1 | 0 1
1 1 | 1 0

MSB = A and B
LSB = (A or B) and (not (A and B))
</code></pre>

<p>It makes sense that you'd be able to compute the MSB faster than the LSB, hence it can be gathered ""earlier"" (closer to the top of the screen).  Just watch the simulation and see that when the bits should be one, the corresponding eater consumes a glider - when they should be zero, the glider streams are stopped before they can reach the eater.</p>

<p>As for how to set up the inputs, it really comes down to whether a single square is on or off in the input construction.  You can see this yourself by clicking an input (say A) and then OK, and then clicking it again:</p>

<p><strong>Edit 4</strong>
In Win32 you send one window message to the button. Everything is handled by WndProc loop. It is damn simple. In Mac you have this magical interface builder which somehow gets all that crap working. The delegate gets called by some withcraft magic. The rest of the classes are connected by some 'magical' force. In windows there is an <strong>tmain</strong> function which is the entry point. That's it! No retarded outlets and such shit.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>If the download is on a separate thread, then fbrereto is correct and you'll need to perform the selector on the main thread. Your code would need to be changed to look like this:</p>

<pre><code>[downloadButton performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(setEnabled:)
    withObject:[NSNumber numberWithBool:NO]
    waitUntilDone:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>A few notes: in Objective-C the keyword <code>NO</code> is used instead of <code>FALSE</code>. It's a primitive type, so in order to use it here we had to box it in a <code>NSNumber</code> object. The <code>waitUntilDone</code> argument does exactly what you would expect, and you can change that to <code>NO</code> if you'd rather not wait.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong></p>

<p>Here's a more complete code example about how to accomplish what I think you want, which is to reuse a single instance of GrooveOnDownload from your app delegate. I'm assuming that your app delegate class is called GrooveOnLiteAppDelegate.</p>

<pre><code>// GrooveOnLiteAppDelegate.h
@interface GrooveOnLiteAppDelegate : NSObject
{
    IBOutlet GrooveOnDownload *grooveOnDownload;
    // other properties go here
}

// your method signatures go here
@end

// GrooveOnLiteAppDelegate.m
@implementation GrooveOnLiteAppDelegate

- (void)mySuperAwesomeMethod
{
    // it's up to you to figure out what method to put this in and
    // how to call it
    NSURLDownload *dw = [[NSURLDownload alloc] initWithRequest:request delegate:grooveOnDownload];
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>Given that code in your app delegate, you'll have an outlet in IB that you can connect to your GrooveOnDownload object in IB. If you do that, then <code>grooveOnDownload</code> will be a pointer to that object.</p>

"2926742","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I have climate data (temperature, precipitation, snow depth) for all of Canada between 1900 and 2009. I have written a basic website and the simplest page allows users to choose category and city. They then get back a very simple report (without the parameters and calculations section):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/r60hi.png"" /></p>

<p>The primary purpose of the web application is to provide a simple user interface so that the general public can explore the data in meaningful ways. (A list of numbers is not meaningful to the general public, nor is a website that provides <a href=""http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/CDODivisionalSelect.jsp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">too many inputs</a>.) The secondary purpose of the application is to provide climatologists and other scientists with deeper ways to view the data. (Using too many inputs, of course.)</p>

<h3>Tool Set</h3>

<p>The database is PostgreSQL with R (mostly) installed. The reports are written using iReport and generated using JasperReports.</p>

<h3>Poor Model Choice</h3>

<p>Currently, a linear regression model is applied against annual averages of daily data. The linear regression model is calculated within a PostgreSQL function as follows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  regr_slope( amount, year_taken ),
  regr_intercept( amount, year_taken ),
  corr( amount, year_taken )
FROM
  temp_regression
INTO STRICT slope, intercept, correlation;
</code></pre>

<p>The results are returned to JasperReports using:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  year_taken,
  amount,
  year_taken * slope + intercept,
  slope,
  intercept,
  correlation,
  total_measurements
INTO result;
</code></pre>

<p>JasperReports calls into PostgreSQL using the following parameterized analysis function:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  year_taken,
  amount,
  measurements,
  regression_line,
  slope,
  intercept,
  correlation,
  total_measurements,
  execute_time
FROM
  climate.analysis(
    $P{CityId},
    $P{Elevation1},
    $P{Elevation2},
    $P{Radius},
    $P{CategoryId},
    $P{Year1},
    $P{Year2}
  )
ORDER BY year_taken
</code></pre>

<p>This is not an optimal solution because it gives the false impression that the climate is changing at a slow, but steady rate. </p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>Using functions that take two parameters (e.g., year [X] and amount [Y]), such as PostgreSQL's <code>regr_slope</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is a better regression model to apply?</li>
<li>What CPAN-R packages provide such models? (Installable, ideally, using <code>apt-get</code>.)</li>
<li>How can the R functions be called within a PostgreSQL function?</li>
</ul>

<p>If no such functions exist:</p>

<ul>
<li>What parameters should I try to obtain for functions that will produce the desired fit?</li>
<li>How would you recommend showing the best fit curve?</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind that this is a web app for use by the general public. If the only way to analyse the data is from an R shell, then the purpose has been defeated. (I know this is not the case for most R functions I have looked at so far.)</p>

There are some gotchas because R likes to think about data in terms of vectors which is not what a RDBMS does.

<p>As for the appropriate modeling: that is a whole different ballgame. <code>loess</code> is a fair suggestion for something non-parametric, and you probably also want some sort of dynamic model, either ARMA/ARIMA or lagged regression.

"2931199","<p>As the title states I'm wondering if it's a good idea for my validation class to have access to all properties from my model. Ideally, I would like to do that because some fields require 10+ other fields to verify whether it is valid or not. I <em>could</em> but would rather not have functions with 10+ parameters. Or would that make the model and validator too coupled with one another? Here is a little example of what I mean. This code however does not work because it give an infinite loop!</p>

</p>

<p>While not perfect, it's way better than what I started with. Basically, I decided to use the decorator pattern. My next step is to most likely remove the Init() function from each validate and replace it with a SetModel() function or something. That way each validate can have access to every property in my model.</p>

<p>Thanks all.</p>
","Should my validator have access to my entire model?","<asp-classic><single-responsibility-principle>","2010-05-28 17:32:08","267","2953484","2","<p>I think you are right in making the validator validate the entire model. To break the infinite loop, you can pass the value to the validator</p>

<pre><code>Public Property Get UserID()
     UserID = m_Validator.IsUserIDValid(m_userID)
End property 

// in Validator
Public Function IsUserIDValid(userID)
    IsUserIDValid = userID &gt; 13
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, if you prefer encapsulation, you can add Friend functions for accessing the property without validation.</p>

<pre><code>Public Property Get UserID()
     UserID = m_Validator.IsUserIDValid()
End property 

Friend Function GetUserID()
   GetUserID = m_userID
End Function

// in Validator
Public Function IsUserIDValid()
    // ""private"" access - to get the unvalidated property
    IsUserIDValid = m_user.GetUserID &gt; 13
End Function
</code></pre>

<p>A third way to do this is to separate your object from validation. The base class defines all the properites without validation. Then you define a child class that adds validation:</p>

<pre><code>class User
    Private m_userID
    Public Property Get UserID()
         UserID = m_userID
    End property 
End Class

class ValidatedUser inherits User
   Public Overrides Property Get UserID()
       if (m_userID&lt;15)
           // handle invalid case, e.g. throw exception with property that is invalid
       UserID = m_userID
   End Property

   Public Function Validate()
    ' class-level validation
   End Function
End Class
</code></pre>

<p>A final variation uses delegation to keep the basic user properties separate from the validated ones. We make User an abstract class, since we have to implementations - one with validation, and one without.</p>

<pre><code>Class MustInherit User
   Public MustInherit Property Get UserID()
End Class

' A simple implementation of User that provides the properties
Class DefaultUser Inherits User
   Private m_UserID
   Public Overrides Property Get UserID()
      UserID = m_UserID
   End Property   
End Class

Class ValidatedUser Inherits User
   private Validator m_validator
   private User m_User

   Public Property Let Validator(value)
        Set m_Validator = value
        m_Validator.Initialize(m_User)
        ' note that validator uses m_User - this breaks the infinite recursion
    End Property

   Public Overrides Property Let UserID(value)
      m_User.UserID = value;
   End Property

   Public Overrides Property Get UserID()
      UserID = m_validator.IsUserValid();
   End Property
End Class   
</code></pre>

<p>In the last example ValidatedUser looks similar to your original code, but the key difference is that ValidatedUser itself doesn't have any property values - it delegates all property accessors to the m_User object. The Validator uses the m_user object which provides simple properties without validation, so the infinite recursion goes away.</p>

<p>At present, validation is done when the property is retrieved. I imagine this is done because you want to validate the data before it's used, and to avoid transient validation errors as properties are assigned. In addition to property-level validation, you may want to also define a ""whole object"" validation method that checks all properties on your object, particularly those involved in multi-property constraints. For example, if you have the constraint A+B+C &lt; 50, then checking A B and C as separate properties will lead to that condition (A+B+C&lt;50) being evaluated 3 times, which is unnecessary, and also confusing since the error will appear on one specific property, when it's really a problem with all 3 properties. Your object-level validator can check this condition just once and flag an error that indicates all 3 properties are not valid.</p>

<p>All of the above bind the Validation to the User class, so that clients can use User without concern for validation. There are benefits and drawbacks with this approach. The benefit is transparency - client's can use User objects and get validation behind the scenes without explicitly asking for it. The downside is that it ties validation very tightly in with your model. An alternative is to completely separate validation from the User object. This not only decouples validation, but also provides for ""whole-object"" validation. E.g.</p>

<pre><code>' User is now a simple class (like DefaultUser above '
' with just properties, no validation '
Class UserValidator

   Public Function Validate(user)
     ' validate the given user object, return a list of
     ' validation errors, each validation error object
     ' that describes the property or properties
     ' that caused the validation error and why it's an error     
     ' E.g. '
     Dim ve As ValidationError 
     ve = new ValidationError
     ve.obj = user;   ' the object that failed validation
     ve.property = ""userID""
     ve.msg = ""userId must be &lt; 15""
     ' potentially put several of these in a list and return to caller     
   End
End Class
</code></pre>

<p>Any code manipulating User will then have to explicitly call Validate after making changes, but this is usually not a problem, and the level of control is much better than having it done automatically. (In my experience,you almost always have to undo ""automatic"" actions at some point because they get in the way.)</p>

<p>I wrote more than I intended. I hope this is helpful!</p>

<p>PS: I don't do much VB, so please be lenient of the occasional syntax error. I am an OO programmer, so I know the principles are correct. And I just noticed the ""asp-classic"" tag - some of the examples use features that may not be available in classic asp, although the separate Validator code - the last example, should be fine on classic asp.</p>

<p>There two notations for return messages either by sending a return message as you did in response to <code>checkAvailability()</code> or by writing the returned value or object behind the called method i.g. <code>checkAvailability() : bool</code> .</p>

<p>Sending a mail is an asynchonous operation and the mail leaves your system. I would suggest to introduce another class Mailer which should process the sendMail() message instead of your class user.

<p>Is this a plugin that you created, or did you download it from somewhere?</p>

<p>I've never seen this myself, but I suspect that you are running Eclipse using an older version of Java (e.g. 1.5) and trying to use a plugin that was compiled for Java 1.6.  Assuming that is the case you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>upgrade the JDK used to run Eclipse to 1.6, </li>
<li>try to find a version of the plugin that was compiled for the Java 1.5 platform, or</li>
<li>download the plugin sources and build it for Java 1.5 yourself.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>

<p>No.  A JAR file built for a Java 1.5 target platform should also work on a Java 1.6 platform.  (Just not the other way around ...)</p>

"2938622","<p>I am looking at multi-tenancy database schema design for an SaaS concept. It will be ASP.NET MVC -> EF, but that isn't so important.</p>

<p>Below you can see an example database schema (the Tenant being the Company). The CompanyId is replicated throughout the schema and the primary key has been placed on both the natural key, plus the tenant Id.</p>

<p>Plugging this schema into the Entity Framework gives the following errors when I add the tables into the Entity Model file (Model1.edmx):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>The relationship 'FK_Order_Customer' uses the set of foreign keys '{CustomerId, CompanyId}' that are partially contained in the set of primary keys '{OrderId, CompanyId}' of the table 'Order'.  The set of foreign keys must be fully contained in the set of primary keys, or fully not contained in the set of primary keys to be mapped to a model.</li>
  <li>The relationship 'FK_OrderLine_Customer' uses the set of foreign keys '{CustomerId, CompanyId}' that are partially contained in the set of primary keys '{OrderLineId, CompanyId}' of the table 'OrderLine'.

<p>The question is in two parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Is my database design incorrect? Should I refrain from these compound primary keys? I'm questioning my sanity regarding the fundamental schema design (frazzled brain syndrome). Please feel free to suggest the 'idealized' schema.</li>
<li>Alternatively, if the database design is correct, then is EF unable to match the keys because it perceives these foreign keys as a potential mis-configured 1:1 relationships (incorrectly)? In which case, is this an EF bug and how can I work around it?</li>

Give some thought again to what makes your primary keys unique. Is the OrderID alone not unique, without a CompanyID? Is a ProductID not unique, without a CompanyID? An OrderLine certainly should be unique without a CompanyID, since an OrderLine should be associated only with a single Order.</p>

<p>If you truly need the CompanyID for all of these, which probably means that the company in question is supplying you with ProductID and OrderID, then you might want to go a different direction, and generate your own primary keys that are not intrinsic to the data. Simply set up an auto-increment column for your primary key, and let these be the internal OrderID, OrderLineID, ProductID, CompanyID, etc. At that point, the OrderLine won't need the customer's OrderID or CompanyID; the foreign key reference to the Order would be its starting point. (And the CustomerID should never be an attribute of an order line; it's an attribute of the order, not the order line.)</p>

<p>Compound keys are just messy. Try designing the model without them, and see if it simplifies things.</p>

<p>So can anyone help me figure out why the browser isn't showing the Yahoo! home page like I asked it to? And while I am at it, I'm going to own up to the fact that this is my first WPF app, and I'd love to hear any general pointers on how to get rid of general noobie badness in my XAML.</p>

From some trial and error I get that they are connected somehow, but not good enough at Objective-C and Memory Management yet to really understand how.</p>

<p>That object is then added to the <code>glucoseLoader</code> NSMutableArray, which will <code>retain</code> it. You loop 100 times, creating 100 objects and adding them to <code>glucoseLoader</code>. When <code>glucoseLoader</code> is released, at line 154, it will also release all the objects added to it.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>using System;

</code></pre>
<p>or:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cs prettyprint-override""><code>public interface ISomeInterface : IHideObjectMembers { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>I tried this in both VS 2008 Express and VS 2008 Standard. However, no members are hidden from IntelliSense at all. I have used the <code>EditorBrowsableAttribute</code> in different projects and it always worked well; however, it doesn't work in this particular scenario.</p>

<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>P.S.:</strong> You can infer my example code from the declarations and the screenshot. I have a class <code>SomeClass</code> with a single dummy method called <code>SomeMethodTwo</code>. Very simple. I have <em>not</em> re-implemented the four <code>System.Object</code> methods in this class, as this should not be necessary.</p>

"2947105","<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Users can pick dates as shown in the following screen shot:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/x2itf.png"" /></p>

<p>Any starting month/day and ending month/day combinations are valid, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mar 22 to Jun 22</li>
<li><strong>Dec 1</strong> to <strong>Feb 28</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The second combination is difficult (I call it the ""tricky date scenario"") because the year for the <em>ending month/day</em> should come <strong>after</strong> the year for the <em>starting month/day</em>. That is to say, for the year 1900 (also shown selected in the screen shot above), the full dates would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dec 22, <strong>1900</strong> to Feb 28, <strong>1901</strong></li>
<li>Dec 22, <strong>1901</strong> to Feb 28, <strong>1902</strong></li>
<li>...</li>
<li>Dec 22, <strong>2007</strong> to Feb 28, <strong>2008</strong></li>
<li>Dec 22, <strong>2008</strong> to Feb 28, <strong>2009</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Problem</h3>

<p>Writing a SQL statement that selects values from a table with dates that fall between the start month/day and end month/day, regardless of how the start and end days are selected. In other words, this is a year wrapping problem.</p>

<h3>Inputs</h3>

<ul>
<li>Year1, Year2: The full range of years, independent of month/day combination.</li>
<li>Month1, Day1: The starting day within the year to gather data.</li>
<li>Month2, Day2: The ending day within the year (or the next year) to gather data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Previous Attempt</h3>

<p>Consider the following MySQL code (that worked):</p>

<pre><code>end_year = start_year +
  greatest( -1 *
    sign(
      datediff(
        date(
          concat_ws('-', year, end_month, end_day )
        ),
        date(
          concat_ws('-', year, start_month, start_day )
        )
      )
    ), 0
  )
</code></pre>

<p>How it works, with respect to the tricky date scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create two dates in the current year.</li>
<li>The first date is <strong>Dec 22, 1900</strong> and the second date is <strong>Feb 28, 1900</strong>.</li>
<li>Count the difference, in days, between the two dates.</li>
<li>If the result is negative, it means the year for the second date must be incremented by 1. In this case:

<ul>
<li>Add 1 to the current year.</li>
<li>Create a new end date: <strong>Feb 28, 1901</strong>.</li>
<li>Check to see if the date range for the data falls between the start and calculated end date.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If the result is positive, the dates have been provided in chronological order and nothing special needs to be done.</li>
</ol>

<p>This worked in MySQL because the difference in dates would be positive or negative.<strike>In PostgreSQL, the equivalent functionality always returns a positive number, regardless of their relative chronological order. (My tests of subtracting dates may have been incorrect, though.)</strike></p>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p>How should the following (broken) code be rewritten for PostgreSQL to take into consideration the relative chronological order of the starting and ending month/day pairs (with respect to introducing that tricky annual temporal displacement)?</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  m.amount
FROM
  measurement m
WHERE
  (extract(MONTH FROM m.taken) &gt;= month1 AND
  extract(DAY FROM m.taken) &gt;= day1) AND
  (extract(MONTH FROM m.taken) &lt;= month2 AND
  extract(DAY FROM m.taken) &lt;= day2)
</code></pre>

<p>Any thoughts, comments, or questions?</p>

<p>(The dates are pre-parsed into MM/DD format in PHP. My preference is for a pure PostgreSQL solution, but I am open to suggestions on what might make the problem simpler using PHP. The SQL lives in a stored procedure that is called by JasperReports, so the only items PHP can touch are the dates passed into the reporting engine.)</p>

<h3>Update #1</h3>

<p>The following code nearly works:</p>

<pre><code>select
  (extract(YEAR FROM m.taken)||'-12-12')::date as start_date,
  ((extract(YEAR FROM m.taken)+
      greatest(
        0,
        sign(
          (extract(YEAR FROM m.taken)||'-12-12')::date -
          (extract(YEAR FROM m.taken)||'-02-01')::date) ))||'-02-01')::date as end_date,
  m.taken,
  extract(YEAR FROM m.taken) as year_taken
from
  measurement m
where
  m.station_id = 200 AND
  m.category_id = 1 AND
  (m.taken, m.taken) OVERLAPS
    ((extract(YEAR FROM m.taken)||'-12-12')::date,
    ((extract(YEAR FROM m.taken)+
      greatest(
        0,
        sign(
          (extract(YEAR FROM m.taken)||'-12-12')::date -
          (extract(YEAR FROM m.taken)||'-02-01')::date) ))||'-02-01')::date)
</code></pre>

<p>It produces the correct start and end date constraints:</p>

<pre><code>start_date  ;end_date    ;taken       ;year_taken
""1969-12-12"";""1970-02-01"";""1969-12-12"";1969
""1969-12-12"";""1970-02-01"";""1969-12-13"";1969
...
""1969-12-12"";""1970-02-01"";""1969-12-31"";1969
""1970-12-12"";""1971-02-01"";""1970-12-12"";1970
</code></pre>

<p>However, the values between <code>1970-01-01</code> and <code>1970-02-01</code> are missing, but must be included.</p>

    (d2 &gt;= d1 AND taken BETWEEN d1 AND d2)
    OR
    (d2 &lt; d1 AND (taken &lt;= d2 OR taken &gt;= d1));
</code></pre>

<p>If the set is big, this doesn't have a lot of chances for optimization. In that case, you can have an SQL function that converts all the dates to a certain year <code>(say taken - (extract(year from taken) - 1900) * '1 year'::interval)</code> and then compare with Dec 02 1900 and Feb 28 1900. That way you can index the result of this date conversion function AND you don't have to calculate two dates for each entry.</p>

"2954986","<p>In an answer to an earlier question of mine regarding fixing the colorspace for scatter images of 4D data, Tom10 suggested plotting values as symbols in order to double-check my data.  An excellent idea.  I've run some similar demos in the past, but I can't for the life of me find the demo I remember being quite simple.</p>

<p>So, what's the easiest way to plot numerical values as the symbol in a scatter plot instead of 'o' for example?  Tom10 suggested plt.txt(x,y,value)- and that is the implementation used in a number of examples.  I however wonder if there's an easy way to evaluate ""value"" from my array of numbers?  Can one simply say: str(valuearray) ?</p>

<p>Do you need a loop to evaluate the values for plotting as suggested in the matplotlib demo section for <a href=""https://matplotlib.org/examples/mplot3d/text3d_demo.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3D text scatter plots</a>?</p>

<p>Their example produces:</p>

<sub>(source: <a href=""http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/_images/text3d_demo.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sourceforge.net</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>However, they're doing something fairly complex in evaluating the locations as well as changing text direction based on data.  So, is there a cute way to plot x,y,C data (where C is a value often taken as the color in the plot data- but instead I wish to make the symbol)?</p>

<p>Again, I think we have a fair answer to this- I just wonder if there's an easier way?</p>

"2957755","<p>So I just wrote a little snippet to generate the Mandelbrot fractal and imagine my surprise when it came out all ugly and skewed (as you can see at the bottom). I'd appreciate a point in the direction of why this would even happen. It's a learning experience and I'm not looking for anyone to do it for me, but I'm kinda at a dead end debugging it. The offending generation code is:</p>

            | otherwise       = mb c (c+q^2) (iter+1)

","Why would an image (the Mandelbrot) be skewed and wrap around?","<image><haskell><mandelbrot>","2010-06-02 12:46:10","513","2958229","2","<p>Well, the image is skewed because the dimensions are wrong, but that's obvious. You're specifying the image size and then spitting out a list of pixels, but with an incorrect number of pixels per line somewhere. </p>

<p>More specifically, note that the image wraps around almost exactly once: In other words, <code>skew per line * height of the image = width of the image</code>. Since the image is square, that means you're generating an extra pixel per line--a good old off-by-one error.</p>

<p>The obvious place for this to happen is when you're generating the coordinates to iterate on. Let's try a small set and see what it gives us:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; length $ argandPlane (-2.5) (-2) 1.5 2 10 10
121
&gt; 10 ^ 2
100
&gt; 11 ^ 2
121
</code></pre>

<p>And so. I suspect the error is because you're calculating the increment as real distance divided by pixel size, which generates the correct number of <em>intervals</em>, but an extra point. Consider the interval from 0.0 to 1.0. Using your calculation with a width of 4, we get:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; let x0 = 0.0
&gt; let x1 = 1.0
&gt; let width = 4.0
&gt; let dx = (x1 - x0) / width
&gt; dx
0.25
&gt; let xs = [x0, x0 + dx .. x1]
&gt; xs
[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
&gt; length xs
5
</code></pre>

<p>So, to get the correct number of points, just reduce the size by 1 when generating the the coordinates.</p>

"2961907","<p>How do you identify missing UDP frames in a custom Wireshark dissector?</p>

<p>I have written a custom dissector for the <a href=""https://dashboard.theice.com/nyxdata-landing.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CQS feed</a> (<a href=""https://dashboard.theice.com/nyxdata-landing.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reference page</a>).  One of our servers gaps when receiving this feed.  According to Wireshark, some UDP frames are never received.  I know that the frames were sent because all of our other servers are gap-free.</p>

<p>A CQS frame consists of multiple messages, each having its own sequence number.  My custom dissector provides the following data to Wireshark:</p>

<pre><code>cqs.frame_gaps          - the number of gaps within a UDP frame (always zero)
cqs.frame_first_seq     - the first sequence number in a UDP frame
cqs.frame_expected_seq  - the first sequence number expected in the next UDP frame
cqs.frame_msg_count     - the number of messages in this UDP frame
</code></pre>

<p>And I am displaying each of these values in custom columns, as shown in this screenshot: <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/XYEJ1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/XYEJ1.jpg"" alt=""wireshark screenshot""></a>
</p>

<p>I tried adding code to my dissector that simply saves the last-processed sequence number (as a local static), and flags gaps when the dissector processes a frame where <code>current_sequence != (previous_sequence + 1)</code>.  This did not work because the dissector can be called in random-access order, depending on where you click in the GUI.  So you could process frame 10, then frame 15, then frame 11, etc.</p>

<p>Is there any way for my dissector to know if the frame that came before it (or the frame that follows) is missing?</p>

<p>The dissector is written in C.</p>

"2967149","<p>I'm interested in finding a way to enumerate all accessible devices on the local network, regardless of their IP address.  For example, in a 192.168.1.X network, if there is a computer with a 10.0.0.X IP address plugged into the network, I want to be able to detect that rogue computer and preferrably communicate with it as well.  Both computers will be running this custom software.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>CLARIFICATION</strong>: We want to handle the situation where we <em>do not know</em> what the single computer's IP address is and cannot guarantee that it's on any particular subnet.  All we know is that the computer is physically plugged into the same switch and the computer has a static IP assigned to it (but that IP could be anything).</p>
  
  <p>We have remote access to one computer on the network (say, 192.168.1.30), and we want to be able to communicate with all other computers on the network, regardless of whether their static IP is set to 192.168.1.x, 10.0.0.x, 10.45.21.7, etc.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I realize that's a vague description, and a full solution to the problem would be lengthy, so I'm really looking for help finding the right direction to go in (""Look into using class XYZ and ABC in this manner"") rather than a full implementation.</p>

<p>The reason I want this is that our company ships imaged computers to thousands of customers, each of which have different network settings (most use the same IP scheme, but a large percentage do not, and most do not have DHCP enabled on their networks).  Once the hardware arrives, we have a hard time getting it up on the network, especially if the IP scheme doesn't match, since there is no one technically oriented on-site.  Ideally, I want to design some kind of console to be used from their main workstation which looks out on the network, finds all computers running our software, displays their current IP address, and allows you to change the IP.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  Unless I've misunderstood something, I don't think I can use the broadcast address 255.255.255.255 to do this.  the problem is that the rogue compuer doesn't have a route back to the originating computer, so it'll drop the packet.  Perhaps I've misunderstood something, but the diagram below shows my understanding of what would happen.</p>

WHERE ([ArticleId] = @ArticleId) ORDER BY [ThreadId] DESC, [DateMade]

<p>As you can see in the image I would like for the client to send a message to the provider (which is the only URI that the client has to know about), which will then redirect this to host1.

<p>I have been attempting to solve the problem by creating a host in the provider that the client sends messages to, and then a client (in the provider) that implements a custom proxy (<a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.remoting.proxies.realproxy?view=netframework-4.8"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">by inheriting from RealProxy</a>) that will redirect messages to the currently preferred host.

I use a full screen transparent overlay form to achieve this, however, as I draw lines with the mouse, what's happening is that the portion of my window that contains the line is becoming visible (as expected). The undesired effect of this is that if the line is over a part of another application such as a textbox, or hyperlink, this changes the cursor back to the default cursor of my app (arrow), instead of the other applications desired cursor (IBeam). I want my overlay to be seamless to the user, and just show their drawing path, rather than have any interaction with the mouse cursor.</p>

","Maple 13 variable assignment does not work","<maple>","2010-06-06 13:26:17","484","2987190","1","<p>The swapcol command is from the linalg package, which works with a matrix and/or a vector. Note the lack of capitalization in <code>matrix</code> and <code>vector</code>.</p>

<p>A <code>matrix</code> in Maple is an object which has so-called last_name_eval rules for its evaluation. See the last_name_eval help-page. So when you enter just the name, then all you get back is that name. You can view the underlying array which is assigned to the name using the evalm, eval, or print commands. For example,</p>

<pre><code>restart:
with(linalg):
m:=matrix(2,2,[1,2,3,4]);
qswap:=swapcol(m,1,2);
qswap;
evalm(qswap);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, the linalg package is officially deprecated in Maple 13. It's recommended replacement is the LinearAlgebra package (introduced in Maple 6, ten years ago). The LinearAlgebra package is for a Matrix or a Vector (not capitalization). The Matrix and Vector objects do not have last_name_eval, in contrast to matrix and vector. For example,</p>

<pre><code>restart:
with(LinearAlgebra):
m:=Matrix(2,2,[[1,2],[3,4]]);
qswap:=ColumnOperation(m,[1,2]);
qswap;
</code></pre>

<p>One last thing. By default only Matrices and Vectors of size &lt;11 get their contents explicitly displayed. You can adjust that with a new cutoff at size 50, say, like this,</p>

<p>… regardless of what plugin I try to use.</p>

<p>I've checked the links to the JS files which are all there and working fine. I'm using Drupal if that makes any difference.</p>

<p>I've run the plugins away from the main site to demonstrate that they are working and that I am doing things right with 100% success.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>My jQuery file called in the footer:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {          

$('#footer_holder').hide();

// Fancy Box
$(""a.fancybox"").fancybox({
    'hideOnContentClick': true,
    'titlePosition' : 'over',

});

$(""#homepage_slider"").easySlider({

","How can I merge code from branch to trunk?","<svn><merge>","2010-06-07 15:29:55","6165","2995772","2","<p>So you want to merge your change <strong>from</strong> <code>special_</code> <strong>to</strong> <code>trunk</code>? I believe you will want to proceed like this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>(Make sure that you have committed all of your changes to <code>special_</code>.)</p></li>
<li><p><code>Team --&gt; Switch to another branch/tag/revision...</code> your working copy to <code>trunk</code> (the <strong>target</strong> of your merge operation), and <strong>resolve any conflicts that come up</strong> at this point.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Team --&gt; Merge</code> opens a dialog where you will be performing the merge operation. Change the ""From"" URL to reference <code>special_</code> (the <strong>source</strong> of your merge operation, i.e. what you want to merge into your working copy). ""From Revision"" should point to the revision in <code>special_</code> where you want your merge operation to ""start"" from - typically the revision that was last merged in from <code>special_</code> to <code>trunk</code> (or perhaps the head revision in your case, if you really want to merge just that latest change of yours).</p></li>
<li><p>Set ""To Revision"" to point to the latest revision in <code>special_</code> (= the head revision).</p></li>
<li><p>At this point you are ready to perform the merge - <code>Dry run</code> command lets you preview what will happen during the merge, and <code>Merge</code> will perform the actual merge.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the merge operation has been completed, you need to make sure that all changes that were performed against your working copy are ok, and resolve all conflicts.</p></li>
<li><p>When you're done with resolving conflicts and reviewing the changes, commit the changes to <code>trunk</code> in a single commit operation. For your own convenience, it is strongly recommended that you add a commit message where you specifically state what this commit is for ( = merging revisions from X to Y from <code>special_</code> to <code>trunk</code>, etc.).</p></li>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Where can I put the <code>&lt;many-to-one&gt;</code> tag in <code>Student.hbm.xml</code> or <code>StudentDetail.hbm.xml</code>? If I put it in <code>Student.hbm.xml</code>, how can I map the column <code>StudentDetail.StudentID</code>, coz it is in a different table?</p>

<p>So this mapping:</p>

    &lt;id name=""ID"" column=""ID""&gt;
      &lt;generator class=""native""/&gt;

<p>generates the following exception:</p>

<pre><code>{""Invalid column name 'StudentID'.""}
</code></pre>

<p>On the other hand <code>&lt;many-to-one&gt;</code> can't be placed in <code>StudentDetail.hbm.xml</code>. Coz, <code>StudentDetail.cs</code> doesn't contain any property of type <code>Student</code>.</p>

<p>Can I use <code>&lt;one-to-one&gt;</code>-tag? If yes where should I place it, in <code>Student.cs</code> or <code>StudentDetail.cs</code>? And how should I configure it?</p>

"2991336","<p>I didn't really know how to phrase the title of my questions, so my apologies in advance.  I read through parts of the MEF documentation to try to find the answer to my question, but couldn't find it.</p>

<p>I'm using ImportMany to allow MEF to create multiple instances of a specific plugin.  That plugin Imports several parts, and within calls to a specific instance, it wants these Imports to be singletons.  However, what I don't want is for all instances of this plugin to use the same singleton.</p>

<p>For example, let's say my application <code>ImportMany</code>s Blender appliances.  Every time I ask for one, I want a different Blender.  However, each Blender <code>Import</code>s a ControlPanel.  I want each Blender to have its own ControlPanel.  To make things a little more interesting, each Blender can load BlendPrograms, which are also contained within their own assemblies, and MEF takes care of this loading.  A BlendProgram might need to access the ControlPanel to get the speed, but I want to ensure that it is accessing the correct ControlPanel (i.e. the one that is associated with the Blender that is associated with the program!)</p>

<p>This diagram might clear things up a little bit:</p>

<p><img src=""https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4042/4679338778_46bed7f0c3_o.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>As the note shows, I believe that the confusion could come from an inherently-poor design.  The BlendProgram shouldn't touch the ControlPanel directly, and instead perhaps the BlendProgram should get the speed via the Blender, which will then delegate the request to its ControlPanel.</p>

<p>If this is the case, then I assume the BlendProgram needs to have a reference to a specific Blender.  In order to do this, is the right way to leverage MEF and use an ImportingConstructor for BlendProgram, i.e.</p>

<p>[ImportingConstructor]
public class BlendProgram : IBlendProgram
{
    public BlendProgram( Blender blender) {}
}</p>

<p>And if this is the case, how do I know that MEF will use the intended Blender plugin?</p>

Expose your control panel through your blender as you say. If you really want to keep your current design, you'll have to decorate the import with metadata and make a custom export provider that will use this metadata to determine what export it should use. If you can get rid of this extra step, do it.</p>

<p><strong><em>BOUNTY UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>Following <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2992264/extracting-a-quadrilateral-image-to-a-rectangle/2999689#2999689"">Denis's</a> link, this is how to use the <a href=""http://threeblindmiceandamonkey.com/?p=16"" rel=""noreferrer"">threeblindmiceandamonkey</a> code:</p>

<pre><code>// the destination rect is our 'in' quad
int dw = 300, dh = 250;
double in[4][4] = {{0,0},{dw,0},{dw,dh},{0,dh}};
    // the quad in the source image is our 'out'
double out[4][5] = {{171,72},{331,93},{333,188},{177,210}};
double homo[3][6];
const int ret = mapQuadToQuad(in,out,homo);
    // homo can be used for calculating the x,y of any destination point
// in the source, e.g.
for(int i=0; i&lt;4; i++) {
    double p1[3] = {out[i][0],out[i][7],1};
    double p2[3];
    transformMatrix(p1,p2,homo);
    p2[0] /= p2[2]; // x
    p2[1] /= p2[2]; // y
    printf(""\t%2.2f\t%2.2f\n"",p2[0],p2[1]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>This provides a transform for converting points in destination to the source - you can of course do it the other way around, but it's tidy to be able to do this for the mixing:</p>

<pre><code>for(int y=0; y&lt;dh; y++) {
    for(int x=0; x&lt;dw; x++) {
        // calc the four corners in source for this
        // destination pixel, and mix
</code></pre>

<p>For the mixing, I'm using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersampling"" rel=""noreferrer"">super-sampling</a> with random points; it works very well, even when there is a big disparity in the source and destination area</p>

<hr>

<p><strong><em>BACKGROUND QUESTION</em></strong></p>

<p>In the image at the top, the sign on the side of the van is not face-on to the camera.  I want to calculate, as best I can with the pixels I have, what it'd look like face on.</p>

<p>I know the corner coordinates of the quad in the image, and the size of the destination rectangle.</p>

<p>I imagine that this is some kind of loop through the x and y axis doing a Bresenham's line on both dimensions at once with some kind of mixing as pixels in the source and destination images overlap - some sub-pixel mixing of some sort?</p>

<p>What approaches are there, and how do you mix the pixels?</p>

<p>Is there a standard approach for this?</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/JN13ym.jpg"" alt=""PICTURE OF THE APP""></p>

<p>On button press, I would like an image to be added to the screen, directly under the spinner and with left alignment. When I press the button again, I want another image to be added to the screen.</p>

<p>So if I pressed the add beer button, a drawable of a beer would appear below the spinner. If I pressed the add beer button again, I want there to be TWO drawables of beers under the spinner, preferably with them being added from the right.</p>

<p>(Also, having them reach their width limit, wrapping around, and starting again on the left, but below a full line, would be AWESOME)</p>

<p>I can't figure out how to do this. I assume adding a ImageView in code to a relative layout (because it needs to be positioned to the right) would be the best route, but if it's possible in xml I'd be more than happy to use that. Any help?</p>

"2995462","<p>There are two master databases and two read-only copies updated by standard transactional replication. It is needed to map some entity from both read-only databases, lets say that A databases contains orders and B databases contains lines.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/kjojL.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/kjojL.png"" alt=""Replication""></a>
</p>

<p>The problem is that replication to one database can lag behind replication of second database, and at the moment of mapping R-databases will have inconsistent data. For example.</p>

<p>We stored 2 orders with lines at 19:00 and 19:03. Mapping process started at 19:05, but to the moment of mapping A database replication processed all changes up to 19:03, but B database replication processed only changes up to 19:00. After mapping we will have order entity with order as of 19:03 and lines as of 19:00. The troubles are guaranteed:)</p>

<p>In my particular case both databases have temporal model, so it is possible to fetch data for every time slice, but the problem is to identify time of latest replication.</p>

<p>Question: How to synchronize replication processes for several databases to avoid situation described above? Or, in other words, how to compare last time of replication in each database?</p>

<p>UPD:</p>

<p>The only way I see to synchronize is to continuously write timestamps into service tables in each database  and to check these timestamps on replicated servers. Is that acceptable solution?   </p>

<li>If max(lines.line_time) &lt; order.last_line_time than lines are obsolete</li>
<li>If max(lines.line_time) == order.last_line_time than everything is OK, for now :)</li>

<p>If I add this ""play"" via Add() every Childobject of Play will be inserted - regardless if some exist already. Since I need to update existing entries I have to do something about that. I guess the problem here is that I have no Id in the XML whatsoever.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell I have the following options:</p>

<ol>
<li>add/update the child entities in my
PlayRepositories Add-Method</li>
<li>restructure and rewrite
ParsePlayInfo() so that get all the
child entities first, add or update
them and <em>then</em> create a new Play.
The only problem I have here is that
I wanted ParsePlayInfo() to be
persistence ignorant, I could work
around this by</li>
<li>creating multiple
parse methods (eg ParseActors() )
and assign them to play in my
controller (I'm using ASP.net MVC)
after everything was parsed and added</li>
</ol>

<p>Currently I am implementing option 1 - but it feels wrong.</p>

<p>What I want to do is update entities that are already in the database and insert new ones that aren't.
Do I have to call SaveChanges() before I Attach/Add Play? There must be a (relatively) easy solution.
I'd appreciate it if someone could guide me in the right direction on this one.</p>

<p>(And on a side note, I just realized that I previously forgot to post this part of my code...)</p>

<p>As you can see, Save() gets called twice - and it gets worse when you consider whats going on in AddOrUpdate():</p>

<pre><code>public Actor AddOrUpdate(Actor entity)
{
    Actor cur = context.Actors.Where(l =&gt; l.Name == entity.Name &amp;&amp; l.Last_Name == entity.Last_Name).FirstOrDefault();

    {
        if (!entity.Mail.IsNullOrEmptyOrWhitespace() &amp;&amp; cur.Mail != entity.Mail)
            cur.Mail = entity.Mail;
    //there are more of these...

        return cur;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I can't believe that this is ""the right"" way to do this.
It feels and looks just wrong. Maybe EF is to blame too, take</p>

<pre><code>FirstEntityType first = new FirstEntityType();
first.Id = 2;
List&lt;SecondType&gt; list = CreateList(); //Let's say this returns a List with 10 elements
context.FirstEntityType.AddObject(first);

for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.Count; i++)
{
    list[i].First = first;
}

//just for arguments sake a second for
for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.Count; i++)
{
    context.SecondType.AddObject(list);
}

context.SaveChanges();
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't tested this particular piece of code but from what I experienced is that I'll end up with 10 new entries for SecondType and if I am not wrong 11 for FirstEntityType.</p>

<p>Why? Why isn't there a mechanism in EF that says ""Hey, wait a minute - those are the same!""</p>

<p>Am I that wrong thinking that EF should behave like if I was using the db directly? In my example, I added ""first"" so I could assume that whenever I use ""first"" it is referenced.
(I really hope my example works as described - don't have the time nor the desire to test it)</p>

See the example application 'Hindsight' to see how Visiblox charts can be applied to an application of this context.</p>

<p>I've attached a crude code snippet of the XAML on how to achieve this effect:</p>

    &lt;/v:Chart&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>Personally, I would take the action that Hindsight does, removing the area under lines when there are multiple series on the plot area. I think at that point the gradients get in the way of the data, and as you mentioned above, to do something about this incurs a computational cost. This could also lead to misinterpretations of the data so be wary.</p>

<p>In terms of getting your data to the chart, you can use the Visiblox BindableDataSeries to bind your business objects directly onto the chart. :)</p>

"3010837","<p>Sampling uniformly at random from an n-dimensional unit simplex is the fancy way to say that you want n random numbers such that</p>

<ul>
<li>they are all non-negative,</li>
<li>they sum to one, and</li>
<li>every possible vector of n non-negative numbers that sum to one are equally likely.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the n=2 case you want to sample uniformly from the segment of the line x+y=1 (ie, y=1-x) that is in the positive quadrant.
In the n=3 case you're sampling from the triangle-shaped part of the plane x+y+z=1 that is in the positive octant of R3:</p>

<p>(Image from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex</a>.)</p>

<p>Note that picking n uniform random numbers and then normalizing them so they sum to one does not work.  You end up with a bias towards less extreme numbers.</p>

<p>Similarly, picking n-1 uniform random numbers and then taking the nth to be one minus the sum of them also introduces bias.</p>

<p>Wikipedia gives two algorithms to do this correctly:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex#Random_sampling"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex#Random_sampling</a>
(Though the second one currently claims to only be correct in practice, not in theory. I'm hoping to clean that up or clarify it when I understand this better. I initially stuck in a ""WARNING: such-and-such paper claims the following is wrong"" on that Wikipedia page and someone else turned it into the ""works only in practice"" caveat.)</p>

What do you consider the best implementation of simplex sampling in Mathematica (preferably with empirical confirmation that it's correct)?</p>

Standard sparse least squares algorithms include LSQR and more recently, LSMR. These only require you to apply matrix-vector products.

For all active constraints, the next iteration you perform will either deactivate the constraint, or constrain you to move along the constraint hyperplane. With some (conceptually relatively simple) suitable modifications to the algorithm you choose, you can implement these constraints.</p>

"3013908","<p>I've written a CMS which uses the PHP function json_encode to send some data back via an Ajax Request.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm trying to load it onto a server which is running PHP version 5.1, the json_encode PHP function is not available on versions of PHP before 5.2.0.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a way to encode a PH array as JSON without using the inbuilt json_encode function?</p>

<pre><code>     $.ajax({
            type: ""GET"",
            url: ""includes/function/add_users.php"",
            data: str,
            dataType: 'json',

"3016940","<p><A href=""http://misko.hevery.com/2010/05/26/do-it-yourself-dependency-injection"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">I recently ran across this great article by Chad Parry entitled ""DIY-DI"" or ""Do-It-Yourself Dependency Injection"".</A>  I'm in a position where I'm not yet ready to use a IoC framework, but I want to head in that direction.  It seems like DIY-DI is a good first step.</p>

<p>However, after reading the article, I'm still a little confused about object creation.  Here's a simple example:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/5ofVd.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Using manual constructor dependency injection (not DIY-DI), this is how one must construct a Hotel object:</p>

<pre><code>PowerGrid powerGrid;           // only one in the entire application
WaterSupply waterSupply;   // only one in the entire application

Staff staff;
Rooms rooms;
Hotel hotel(staff, rooms, powerGrid, waterSupply);
</code></pre>

<p>Creating all of these dependency objects makes it difficult to construct the Hotel object in isolation, which means that writing unit tests for Hotel will be difficult.  </p>

<p><strong>Does using DIY-DI make it easier?<br>
What advantage does DIY-DI provide over manual constructor dependency injection?</strong></p>
","Simple object creation with DIY-DI?","<dependency-injection>","2010-06-10 17:37:30","855","3020304","2","<p>There's no difference between what you call DIY-DI and manual constructor injection.</p>

<p>If it's too difficult creating a <code>Hotel</code> instance you can do two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that the dependencies are expressed as either interfaces or abstract base classes. This lets you test the <code>Hotel</code> class in isolation by providing <a href=""http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Double.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Test Doubles</a> such as dynamic mocks or similar instead of concrete classes.</li>

<p>As an application grows in complexity, so does the task of managing the lifetimes of all dependencies. While it's technically possible to manually compose an entire application, this is exactly the point where a <strong>DI Container</strong> can be extremely helpful.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa380261(VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>CryptProtectData</code></a></li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa380882(v=VS.85).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>CryptUnprotectData</code></a>    </li>
</ul>

<p>to encrypt data with the current user's account. <code>CredRead</code>/<code>CredWrite</code> then store the data in some magical location, contents of which you can see from the Control Panel:</p>

<p>What API does IE use to store passwords, and if it uses <code>CryptProtectData</code>, where does it then store the protected data?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> The reason I ask needs no explanation (since it's pretty obvious), but it's because I might want to use the same mechanism.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Http-Auth:</strong> <code>%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Credentials</code>, in encrypted files</li>
<li><strong>Form-based:</strong> <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet  Explorer\IntelliForms\Storage2</code>, encrypted with the url</li>
</ul>

<p>From a <a href=""http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/internet_explorer_password.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very good page on NirSoft.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starting from version 7.0 of Internet
  Explorer, Microsoft completely changed
  the way that passwords are saved. In
  previous versions (4.0 - 6.0), all
  passwords were saved in a special
  location in the Registry known as the
  ""Protected Storage"".  In version 7.0
  of Internet Explorer, passwords are
  saved in different locations,
  depending on the type of password.
  Each type of passwords has some
  limitations in password recovery:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><p><strong>AutoComplete Passwords:</strong> These
  passwords are saved in the following
  location in the Registry:
  <code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet
  Explorer\IntelliForms\Storage2</code>  The
  passwords are encrypted with the URL
  of the Web sites that asked for the
  passwords, and thus they can only be
  recovered if the URLs are stored in
  the history file. If you clear the
  history file, IE PassView won't be
  able to recover the passwords until
  you visit again the Web sites that
  asked for the passwords.
  Alternatively, you can add a list of
  URLs of Web sites that requires user
  name/password into the Web sites file
  (see below). </p></li>
  <li><p><strong>HTTP Authentication
  Passwords:</strong> These passwords are stored
  in the Credentials file under
  <code>Documents and Settings\Application
  Data\Microsoft\Credentials</code>, together
  with login passwords of LAN computers
  and other passwords.  Due to security
  limitations, IE PassView can recover
  these passwords only if you have
  administrator rights.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In my particular case it answers the question of where; and I decided that I don't want to duplicate that. I'll continue to use <code>CredRead</code>/<code>CredWrite</code>, where the user can manage their passwords from within an established UI system in Windows.</p>

<p>The actual datatbase binding is kindof complex as well. With multiple keys for each table in the hierarchy because each table can contain the same key that belongs to different parents... for example</p>

<p>taxonomy code : 207R00000X which breaks down to: 20 7R 00000 translates to: Allopathic,internal medicine,internal medicine
taxonomy code : 208M00000X which breaks down to: 20 8M 00000 translates to: allopathic, hospitalist, hospitalist</p>

<p>Each of those break downs is the keyfield in its own table.</p>

<p>If I don't bind oneway I get this ErrorMessage:""The property 'TaxonomySpecializationID' is part of the object's key information and cannot be modified.""</p>

However, I'm experiencing a bit of a problem where the resulting menu has two levels of menu-items (i.e. each <code>MenuItem</code> is contained in a <code>MenuItem</code>):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/vfrvc.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/vfrvc.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>My guess is that this is happening because WPF is automatically generating a <code>MenuItem</code> for my binding, but the ""viewer"" I'm using actually already <em>is</em> a <code>MenuItem</code> (it's derived from <code>MenuItem</code>):</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ContextMenu
    x:Name=""selectionContextMenu""
    ItemsSource=""{Binding Source={x:Static OrangeNote:Note.MultiCommands}}""
    ItemContainerStyleSelector=""{StaticResource separatorStyleSelector}""&gt;
    &lt;ContextMenu.ItemTemplate&gt;
        &lt;DataTemplate&gt;
            &lt;Viewers:NoteCommandMenuItemViewer
                CommandParameter=""{Binding Source={x:Static OrangeNote:App.Screen}, Path=SelectedNotes}"" /&gt;
        &lt;/DataTemplate&gt;
    &lt;/ContextMenu.ItemTemplate&gt;
&lt;/ContextMenu&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><em>(The ItemContainerStyleSelector is from <a href=""http://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/?p=23"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://bea.stollnitz.com/blog/?p=23</a>, which allows me to have <code>Separator</code> elements inside my bound source.)</em></p>

<p>So, the menu is bound to a collection of <code>ICommand</code>s, and each item's <code>CommandParameter</code> is set to the same global target (which happens to be a collection, but that's not important).</p>

<p>My question is, is there any way I can bind this such that WPF doesn't automatically wrap each item in a <code>MenuItem</code>?</p>

<p>Then set the CommandParameter binding in the NoteCommandMenuItemViewer style, or in ContextMenu.ItemContainerStyle, whichever is more appropriate.</p>

<p>This presumes you can't simply use ItemContainerStyle on a regular MenuItem to get the effect you want:</p>

<p>I won't say what I will suggest is actually the best solution available, because in game design there is generally ""no best"" solution, but still I think it would make you think appropriately.</p>

<p><em>Larger UML <a href=""http://yuml.me/1924128b"">here.</a></em></p>

<p><em>Let's say you have your basic class <code>Game</code>. It's something abstract class, that wraps all your game logics and works as a sort of Swiss knife.</em></p>

<p>You should create two another classes - <code>UI</code> and <code>State</code> (which, obviously, encapsulate game UI operations and store current game state). Let your <code>Game</code> class hold <code>UI</code> and <code>State</code> instances.</p>

<p>Now, your <code>Game</code> class should have basic methods to control your game. They could be plain <code>render(...)</code> and <code>update(...)</code> methods and this part is actually a bit tricky. If your game is real-time, you would have to update your state every Y milliseconds, so your <code>update(...)</code> should be called in a loop.</p>

<p>If your game isn't actually real-time, your updates should happen only when user does something or you <em>actually know</em> that you need to change something. You could implement a message queue here and <code>update(...)</code> call would simply flush all those messages.</p>

<p>Now, the <code>render(...)</code> method. Create some class and call it <code>Backend</code> - let this class encapsulate all your drawing possibilities. <em>There is one really cool thing here - you could let your <code>Backend</code> be an abstract superclass and create some <strong>concrete</strong> backends, which derive from <code>Backend</code>. And that would actually give you an opportunity to switch your <code>Backends</code> with simple code manipulations.</em></p>

<p>After that, you should pass your <code>Backend</code> instance to your <code>render(...)</code> method, which would do appropriate drawing and it's logic could be written the following way:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (const Object&amp; object, game_state) {
   object-&gt;render(backend); // Or something like that
}
</code></pre>

<p>The last thing to mention, your game state. You could have a plain structure to hold all your current objects, score, etc, etc. Let every object access that <code>GameState</code> structure and everything will be fine.</p>

<p><em>Actually, there are many things to think about, if you wish to, I could write more about this game design approach and share some tricks :)</em></p>

"3039272","<p>I usually use Vim, and its great for the ability to do faster some actions than other editors. However, since I live in Argentina I have a Latin American keyboard, that makes everything in Vim pretty slower (to write / to search, I must press Shift+7).</p>

<p>Since I don't want to be changing Keyboard layouts all the time (and its pretty difficult to get used to pressing symbols as in an English keyboard), I was wondering if there was a vim plugin (of .vimrc file) that may be useful for international users.</p>

<p>Just for the sake of it, here's how the Latin American keyboard is laid out:</p>

<ol>
<li>Since you said you'd love to buy an English keyboard, I'd recommend just changing your keyboard layout.  on Windows you can do so under Regional Settings. On a basic Linux console you can use <code>loadkeys</code>.  Under X11 you can use <code>setxkbmap</code>.</li>
<li>Just live with it the way it is. The vim help will make the most sense this way.</li>
<li>Search for a language map for your latin american keyboard.  For instance, take a look at <a href=""http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Using_Vim_with_the_Dvorak_keyboard_layout"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this one for dvorak</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>I use the Dvorak keyboard layout and I just live with it the way it is. If there's a command or two that are very cumbersome, map them to something easy on your keyboard. There will inevitably be other shortcuts that are easier because of the different keyboard layout, but overall efficiency will depend on your layout and what features you use.</p>

"3040841","<p>I'd like to know if it ever makes sense to provide some functionality in a piece of software that is only available to the user through a context (right click) menu. It seems that in most software I've worked with the right click menu is always used as a quick way to get to features that are otherwise available from other buttons or menus.</p>

<p>Below is a screen shot of the UI I'm developing. The tree view on the right shows the user's library of catalogs. Users can create new catalogs, or add and remove existing catalogs to and from their library. Catalogs in their library can then be opened or closed, or set to read-only.</p>

<p><img src=""https://imgur.com/GUb7O.jpg"" alt=""Screen Shot""></p>

<p>The screen shot shows the context menu I've created for the browser. Some commands can be executed independently from any specific catalog (New, Add).  Yet the other commands must be applied to a specifically selected catalog (Close, Open, Remove, ReadOnly, Refresh, Clean UP, Rename).</p>

<p>Currently the ""Catalog"" menu at the top of the window looks identical to this context menu. Yet I think this may be confusing to the users as the tree view which shows the currently selected catalog may not always be visible. The user may have switched to the Search or Filters tab, or the left pane may be hidden entirely.  </p>

<p>However, I'm hesitant to change the UI so that the commands that depends on a specifically selected catalog are only available through the context menu. </p>
","Is it wrong for a context (right click) menu be the only way a user can perform a certain task?","<user-interface>","2010-06-14 20:53:34","823","3044772","5","<p>The Windows User Experience Interaction Guidelines for Windows 7 and Windows Vista states (pg233):</p>

<p>“Don’t make commands only available through context menus. Like shortcut keys, context menus are alternative means of performing commands and choosing options.” </p>

<p>The Apple Human Interface Guidelines states (pg189):</p>

<p>“Always ensure that contextual menu items are also available as [pulldown] menu commands. A contextual menu is hidden by default and a user might not know it exists, so it should never be the only way to access a command.”</p>

<p>In your case, opening and closing the catalogue appears already available through the +/- buttons in the tree itself, so you’re already consistent with the Windows guidelines, if not the Apple guidelines. IMO, the only reason to put them on the context menu at all is if they're the default (double-click) action (which they're not right now). Rename may also already be available by directly selecting the name of a selected catalog, but you may want a pulldown menu item for that any way since that may be no more discoverable than the context menu. The rest of the commands probably belong on a pulldown menu in addition to the context menu.</p>

<p>As far as the Catalog pulldown menu being redundant with the Catalog context menu, you may want to consider organizing your pulldown menus by <em>type of action</em>, rather than class of object, in order to provide an alternative organization. As you’ve realized, context menus already organize commands by class of object. In addition to providing an alternative organization that some of you users may find more intuitive, this may simplify your menubar. For example, rather than a Catalog and Family menus, you can have a single Edit menu with Add, Delete, Rename, Copy, etc. where these commands apply to whatever is selected, whether it be a catalog, folder, or family. If they don't apply to the current selection, they're disabled, but if it makes any sense in your app, make them apply.</p>

<p>BTW, what’s the difference between Add Catalog and New Catalog? </p>

"3045258","<p>I have a ItemsControl in a ScrollViewer, and when the items exceed the width of the ScrollViewer they are put into a ContextMenu and shown as a DropDown instead. My problem is that when the Context Menu is first loaded, it saves the saves the size of the Menu and does not redraw when more commands get added/removed.</p>

<p>For example, a panel has 3 commands. 1 is visible and 2 are in the Menu. Viewing the menu shows the 2 commands and draws the control, but then if you resize the panel so 2 are visible and only 1 command is in the menu, it doesn't redraw the menu to eliminate that second menu item. Or even worse, if you shrink the panel so that no commands are shown and all 3 are in the Menu, it will only show the top 2.</p>

","Power Point 2010 youtube embeding problem","<vba><youtube><powerpoint>","2010-06-16 04:34:08","990","3056985","1","<p>Well, I guess I'll turn this into a programming question for the benefit of others needing this programmatically as well.</p>

<p>The most likely cause here is that you're using an x64 version of PowerPoint 2010. The <a href=""http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/powerpoint-help/embed-a-video-in-your-presentation-HA010374729.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">help file</a> states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>PowerPoint 2010 64-bit is not
  compatible with 32-bit versions of
  QuickTime or Flash. You must install a
  64-bit version of QuickTime or Flash,
  or a 32-bit version of PowerPoint
  2010.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Kind of pointless to say that because neither Flash or QT have 64-bit versions. That said, you can still embed (actually, ""link to"") a file programmatically by using code, such as:</p>

<pre><code>Sub InsertWebVideo()
Dim sl As Slide
Set sl = ActivePresentation.Slides(28)
sl.Shapes.AddMediaObjectFromEmbedTag EmbedTag:= _
        ""&lt;object width='640' height='385'&gt;"" &amp; _
        ""&lt;param name='movie' value='http://www.youtube.com/v/gejJM3n2LHU&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;'&gt;"" &amp; _
        ""&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name='allowFullScreen' value='true'&gt;&lt;/param&gt;"" &amp; _
        ""&lt;param name='allowscriptaccess' value='always'&gt;&lt;/param&gt;"" &amp; _
        ""&lt;embed src='http://www.youtube.com/v/gejJM3n2LHU&amp;hl=en_US&amp;fs=1&amp;' "" &amp; _
        ""type='application/x-shockwave-flash' allowscriptaccess='always' "" &amp; _
        ""allowfullscreen='true' width='640' height='385'&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;""
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>The issue is that this just doesn't work at all on x64 - an object appears on the slide, but nothing happens. Embedding Silverlight doesn't seem to work though as Windows Media Player kicks an error. If you happen to have a WMV on a website, give that a try with <code>&lt;embed/&gt;</code> code using something like the code above.</p>
"
"3051864","<p>I would like to create a game with an endless (in reality an extremely large) world in which the player can move about. Whether or not I will ever get around to implement the game is one matter, but I find the idea interesting and would like some input on how to do it. </p>

<p>The point is to have a world where all data is generated randomly on-demand, but in a <em>deterministic</em> way. </p>

<p>Currently I focus on a large 2D map from which it should be possible to display any part without knowledge about the surrounding parts.</p>

<p>I have implemented a prototype by writing a function that gives a random-looking, but deterministic, integer given the x and y of a pixel on the map (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3043521/a-function-where-small-changes-in-input-always-result-in-large-changes-in-output"">my recent question about this function</a>). Using this function I populate the map with ""random"" values, and then I smooth the map using a simple filter based on the surrounding pixels. This makes the map dependent on a few pixels outside its edge, but that's not a big problem. The final result is something that at least looks like a map (especially with a good altitude color map). Given this, one could maybe first generate a coarser map which is used to generate bigger differences in altitude to create mountain ranges and seas.</p>

<p>Anyway, that was <em>my</em> idea, but I am sure that there exist ways to do this already and I also believe that given the specification, many of you can come up with better ideas. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> 
Forgot the link to my question.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong>
I think I'll have to clarify that it is important that two adjacent parts of the map, generated separately, needs to smoothly connect to each other.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3:</strong>
Some more information was asked for in the comments.</p>

<p>Here's an image taken <a href=""http://www.neilblevins.com/cg_education/fractal_noise/fractal_noise.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">from a page about fractal and Perlin Noise</a> that looks much like what I have produced myself previously (since my best attempt probably used Perlin Noise):</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Zf02e.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Zf02e.jpg"" alt=""""></a></p>

<p>Think of black pixels as deep sea and white pixels as mountain tops. This is what I need, a simple 2D elevation map.</p>

<p>What I want to be able to do is to pick any rectangle from the very large world (in the range of MAXINT * MAXINT pixels) and generate it. If I would generate any part of the image above it should get exactly the same pixels as if I generated a bigger part encompassing the smaller one.</p>

<p>Now on to Unreason's questions:</p>

<p><em>Required performance</em>: My main aim would be a turn based RPG, so performance could be quite low, but I think it would be very interesting to see if it is possible to create a fast algorithm.</p>

<p><em>Memory requirements</em>: Preferably nothing should be pregenerated, but other than that, memory usage should match any ordinary game or application.</p>

<p><em>Required detail</em>: Well, if you look at the image, you get the idea. It would be very nice though, if it was possible to zoom out and pan without having to calculate the map at the most zoomed in level first.</p>

<p><em>Required types of objects and object properties to generate</em>: Nothing fancy, I am happy with the terrain according to the image above. But I admit I've been thinking of a similar setup where everything is a very very big city. That would be another question, though.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 4:</strong> Hopefully the final one.</p>

<p>OK, after reading a bit it seems that Perlin Noise is the way to go. I have one more question though (if someone cares to answer now that I have accepted one (actually two) answers :) ).</p>

<p>The perlin noise function takes doubles. What's the range for these doubles? [0-1[ ? Or can I happily send in my large integers?</p>
","How can I generate an ""unlimited"" world?","<algorithm><dictionary><random>","2010-06-16 08:54:09","7195","3052123","5","<p>Normally, all terrain/world generators work in the way you described - they are able to produce vast (random-looking) worlds from a very limited input data (set of parameters).</p>

<p>So, you might want to put further constraints on your question. </p>

<p>If anything will work for you or if you are just begging to research - take a look at different focuses and approaches <a href=""http://www.vterrain.org/Elevation/Artificial/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>

<p>As for randomness/deterministic I am not sure that you really talk about randomness here and it can be a bit confusing, I think you only want to be able to create a lot of variations. So you might want to drop that from your search terms.</p>

<p>Take a look also at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">procedural generation</a> (especially 'see also' and 'external links').</p>

<p>Personally, I think there is a lot of promise in the concept of <a href=""http://www.howardzzh.com/research/terrain/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">terrain synthesis</a> where you basically mix and match real terrain samples with some sort of transforming operations - which provides realistically looking terrain with desired properties.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:
Here's an <a href=""http://bocoup.com/processing-js/docs/index.php?page=Plasma%20Fractals"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">implementation</a> of 'plasma fractals' (mid-point displacement) in <a href=""http://processing.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">processing</a>.</p>

<p>If that is good enough for you then you could rework the algorithm to allow it to generate any part of the grid (I have a feeling it will boil down to hashing the coordinates to get random number seed around connecting lines, or everywhere).</p>

<p>Also you might work with different levels of detail with this method so that you can generate more detail closer to the point of view.</p>

"3056266","<p>I'm writing an internal-tools webapp; one of the central pages in this tool has a whole bunch of related commands the user can execute by clicking one of a number of buttons on the page, like this:</p>

<p>Ideally, all of the buttons would fit on one line. Ordinarily I'd do this by changing each widget from a button with a (sometimes long) text label to a simple, compact icon - e.g.</p>

<p><a href=""http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/773/saver.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">button labelled &quot;Save&quot; http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/773/saver.png</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don't think I can do this for every button on this particular page. Some of the command buttons just don't have good visual analogs - ""VDS List"". Or, if I needed to add another button in the future for some other kind of list, I'd need two icons that both communicate ""list-ness"" and <em>which</em> list. So, I'm still considering this option, but I don't love it.</p>

<p>So it's come time for me to add yet another button to this section (don't you love internal tools?). There's not enough room on that single line to fit the new button. Aside from the icon solution I already mentioned, what would be a good* way to simplify/declutter/reduce or otherwise improve this UI?</p>

"3058992","<p>I'm trying to develop an algorithm that identifies all possible paths between two nodes in a graph, as in this example:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Z2ek2.jpg"" alt=""image"">.</p>

<p>in fact, i just need to know which nodes appear in all existing paths.</p>

<p>in the web only got references about DFS, A* or dijkstra, but i think they doesn't work in this case.</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to solve it?</p>
","All possible paths in a cyclic undirected graph","<java><c++><algorithm>","2010-06-17 05:02:32","6539","3059528","5","<p>You can find all paths using DFS like |Vlad described. To find which nodes appear in every path, you could just maintain an array of booleans that says whether each node has appeared in every path so far. When your DFS finds a path, go through each vertex <em>not</em> in the path and set the corresponding array value to false. When you are done, only the vertices with values of true will be the ones that appear in every path.</p>

<p>Pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>int source;
int sink;
int nVerts;
bool inAllPaths[nVerts]; // init to all true
bool visited[nVerts]; // init to all false
stack&lt;int&gt; path; // init empty

bool dfs(int u)
  if (visited[u])
    return;
  if (u == sink)
    for i = 0 to nVerts-1
      if !stack.contains(i)
        inAllPaths[i] = false;
    return true;
  else
    visited[u] = true;
    stack.push(u);
    foreach edge (u, v)
      dfs(v);
    stack.pop();
    visited[u] = false;
    return false;


main()
  dfs(source);
  // inAllPaths contains true at vertices that exist in all paths
  // from source to sink.
</code></pre>

<p>However, this algorithm isn't very efficient. For example, in a complete graph of n vertices (all vertices have edges to all others) the number of paths will be n! (n factorial).</p>

<p>A better algorithm would be to check for the existence in every path of each vertex separately. For each vertex, try to find a path from the source to the sink without going to that vertex. If you can't find one, that's because the vertex appears in every path.</p>

<p>Pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>// Using the same initialisation as above, but with a slight modification
// to dfs: change the foreach loop to
foreach edge (u, v)
  if (dfs(v))
    return true; // exit as soon as we find a path

main()
  for i = 0 to nVerts-1
    set all visited to false;
    if (inAllPaths[i])
      visited[i] = true;
      if (dfs(source))
        inAllPaths[i] = false;
      visited[i] = false;
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this still has exponential worst case when searching for a path. You can fix this by changing the search to a breadth-first search. If I'm not mistaken, this should give you O(VE) performance.</p>

<p>In this particular case, they're using a custom View called ContactHeaderWidget, which is actually a FrameLayout wrapping a TextView and Checkbox (styled to look like a star), along with the photo view (which has some special behavior to bind with the multiple contact source data on click and so on).</p>

<li>Click the <code>ComboBox</code> drop down button -- this displays the list of items and selects the text in the <code>ComboBox</code></li>
<li>Type '5', '1' ... i.e. I'm looking to use autocomplete to search for 515, 516, etc.</li>
<li>You'll see that the autocomplete window now appears ON TOP of the drop down list.  However if I mouse over, it's the obscured drop down window behind the autocomplete window that's receiving the mouse events, including the click.  So I think I'm clicking on an autocomplete item but actually clicking on something totally random that I can't see.</li>

<p>Is this a bug in the <code>ComboBox</code>?  I'm using Windows 7 if that matters.  Am I configuring the <code>ComboBox</code>wrong somehow?</p>

<p>Yeah, erm... No.
The error shown in the original question shows a parsing/compilation error - these errors happen in the HttpHandler pipeline for ASP.NET (ISAPI Filter in older IIS versions) i.e. <em>before</em> your application is event started, so before any of the events in Global.asax.</p>

<p>Although you can specify a custom error page (in web.config, machine.config, or IIS metabase), these can only be HTML files.</p>

<p>1) if you're only interested in exceptions which arise in your code (i.e. your code compiles, but then an exception is thrown) then you can use Dan's suggestion from above and handle the Application_Error event in Glocal.asax.</p>

<p>If you want to handle ASP.NET exceptions (e.g. Parsing/Compilation errors, config files errors, etc) then you'll need to hook in (or replace) the ASP.NET HttpHandler.</p>

<p>You could wrap the existing handler by writing your own, and catching any exceptions, then redirecting to another error page.</p>

<p>You'd specify your handler in your web.config file (or machine.config if it's a global handler).</p>

<p>There are some good tutorials on the web on how to do this.

<p>(main problem is: to catch parsing/compilation errors you need to write a handler/filter which is a level <em>above</em> the ASP.NET handler/filter (I believe)).</p>

"3073365","<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>A PostgreSQL database uses PL/R to call R functions. An R call to calculate Spearman's correlation looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code>cor( rank(x), rank(y) )
</code></pre>

<p>Also in R, a naïve calculation of a fitted generalized additive model (GAM):</p>

<pre><code>data.frame( x, fitted( gam( y ~ s(x) ) ) )
</code></pre>

<p>Here <code>x</code> represents the years from 1900 to 2009 and <code>y</code> is the average measurement (e.g., minimum temperature) for that year.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>The fitted trend line (using GAM) is reasonably accurate, as you can see in the following picture:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/t71Dw.png"" /></p>

<p>The problem is that the correlations (shown in the bottom left) do not accurately reflect how closely the model fits the data.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Solution</strong></p>

<p>One way to improve the accuracy of the correlation is to use a root mean square error (RMSE) calculation on binned data.</p>

<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p><em>Q.1.</em> How would you implement the RMSE calculation on the binned data to get a correlation (between 0 and 1) of GAM's fit to the measurements, in the R language?</p>

<p><em>Q.2.</em> Is there a better way to find the accuracy of GAM's fit to the data, and if so, what is it (e.g., root mean square deviation)?</p>

<p><strong>Attempted Solution 1</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Call the PL/R function using the observed amounts and the model (GAM) amounts: <pre><code>correlation_rmse := climate.plr_corr_rmse( v_amount, v_model );</code></pre></li>
<li>Define <code>plr_corr_rmse</code> as follows (where <code>o</code> and <code>m</code> represent the observed and modelled data): <pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION climate.plr_corr_rmse(
o double precision[], m double precision[])
RETURNS double precision AS
$BODY$
sqrt( mean( o - m ) ^ 2 )
$BODY$
LANGUAGE 'plr' VOLATILE STRICT
COST 100;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>o - m</code> is wrong. I'd like to bin both data sets by calculating the <code>mean</code> of every 5 data points (there will be at most 110 data points). For example:</p>

<pre><code>omean &lt;- c( mean(o[1:5]), mean(o[6:10]), ... )
mmean &lt;- c( mean(m[1:5]), mean(m[6:10]), ... )
</code></pre>

<p>Then correct the RMSE calculation as:</p>

<pre><code>sqrt( mean( omean - mmean ) ^ 2 )
</code></pre>

<p>How do you calculate <code>c( mean(o[1:5]), mean(o[6:10]), ... )</code> for an arbitrary length vector in an appropriate number of bins (5, for example, might not be ideal for only 67 measurements)?</p>

<p>I don't think <code>hist</code> is suitable here, is it?</p>

<p><strong>Attempted Solution 2</strong></p>

<p>The following code will solve the problem, however it drops data points from the end of the list (to make the list divisible by 5). The solution isn't ideal as the number ""5"" is rather magical.</p>

<pre><code>while( length(o) %% 5 != 0 ) {
  o &lt;- o[-length(o)]
}

omean &lt;- apply( matrix(o, 5), 2, mean )
</code></pre>

<p>What other options are available?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>You could calculate the correlation between the fitted values and the measured values:</p>

<pre><code>cor(y,fitted(gam(y ~ s(x))))

<p>I don't see why you want to bin your data, but you could do it as follows:</p>

"3073615","<p>I've run into the issue of using a <code>UIBarButtonItem</code> with a custom color.  Everything out on the 'net seems to indicate that the only way around this lack of official API support revolves around the use of images.  This is all fine and dandy when developing for pre-iOS 4 devices, except when using the new iPhone 4.  Creating an image for iPad and pre-iOS 4 devices is straightforward enough, but the images developed for those devices look absolutely horrid on iPhone 4.  I suspect that this problem will be exacerbated further with the introduction of next generation devices.</p>

<p>Consider the example below.  Notice how the default colored button is nice and smooth, but the iPhone 3GS image looks terrible.  It does not seem very scalable (pun intended) to have to include multiple images for different resolution devices.</p>

<p><img src=""https://waynehartman.com/downloads/so/ios4.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>In the absence of an official API for changing the color of a <code>UIBarButtonItem</code>, what strategies are out there for creating images that scale well against differing resolution devices?  This problem is hardly unique to UIBarButtonItems, how is the community adapting to other UI elements that are bitmapped?  Is there a better solution for this particular case than using an image (such as using Quartz to draw it)?</p>

<p>If at all possible, please offer concrete code examples.</p>

This application uses private APIs to change the colors of the <code>UIBarButtonItem</code> objects and then uses a graphics context to save them to a determined location on your computer's file system.  This way you can have pixel perfect <code>UIBarButtonItem</code> images to use in your <code>UIToolbar</code>s.</p>

To cross the street, each car must first enter the corner closest to them, then the next corner.</p>

<p>However, if you lock each corner separately, you can get into deadlock (the concurrency equivalent of gridlock in your example) due to the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dining Philosopher's Problem</a>.  This happens when all four cars enter (""lock"") the closest square, and all of them wait on the next clockwise car to clear the second square.  See that link for solutions. </p>

<p>Considering the intersection as four resources is of course only one solution.  You could also consider treating the entire intersection as a resource as has been suggested (similar to an all-way stop, but not exactly), though that doesn't closely mirror actual traffic flow either.  You could also establish synchronization rules for the four corners that mirror a traffic light.</p>

<p>FYI, I didn't explicitly choose the font I want to use in my GUI application. I solely let the system decide their own during startup. I however, do explicitly set the locale, before show up the GUI.</p>

<p>The system will always choose </p>

<p>The point is, that beauty of characters is not necessarily the user interface goal. It is not everything. What you should look for, is readability of text. When your Chinese characters look not smooth, it may be exactly what helps human eye's control loop to know that it is in focus and stop blaming the eye muscules for blurriness.

"3077597","<p>I have a list of Groups that can vary in number, with Items in these groups that also vary in number. I've been racking my head over a way to get all possible combinations of 1 Item from every Group.</p>

<p>Bonus: I also need all combinations of not having every items from a group.  </p>

<p>I've seen and done what was <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/127704/algorithm-to-return-all-combinations-of-k-elements-from-n/127898#127898"">mentioned before</a>, but that requires knowing the number of groups to begin with.</p>

<p>To be more specific about what I'm doing, I would like to generate products with exact pricing based off product options.  Here's an example list:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/UaGI8.png"" alt=""Group/Item Example""></p>

<p>So it would generate products like:</p>

<p>UV Coating, Qty 500, Color 4:0<br>
UV Coating, Qty 500, Color 4:1<br>
etc...  </p>

<p>Each of these Groups has an ID, and each item has a Group_Item_ID.  So I can put them in an array such as:</p>

<pre><code>$selections[1][...]  // 1 = Coating
$selections[2][...]  // 2 = Quantity
// ... = all selected Items in group
</code></pre>

<p>Hope I explained it well enough. I'm just not able to wrap my head around how to do this when the number of Groups are variable also.</p>

<p>Here's an example array for the groups and their items:</p>

        [0] =&gt; 2

<p>Game works in this way : Each image has atributes 'place' and 'number'. 'Place' is the current place on grid (either correct or not) and 'number' is the desired place for the image. When a user clicks image their 'place' and 'number' attributes are checked. If they match nothing happens. If not game checks if any image is currently in memory. If there is none, then this image's 'place' and 'number' are stored. If there is some image in memory, then the currently clicked image's 'plac'e is checked with stored image's 'number'. When they match - their places are exchanged. This part works properly. But now, I'm calling addComponent method on my JPanel with updated images and simply nothing happens.

<p>As for the plugins, it can't register your event types because they refer to object classes that haven't been registered yet.  Unfortunately, the PS Plugin system doesn't have any way of automatically resolving dependencies, and the compiler's error message doesn't tell you which type it couldn't find.  You'll need the debugger to help you resolve this.  But a lot of the basics, including TObject (yes, you have to import it explicitly) are found in TPSImport_Classes.</p>

What I mean by that is that as AtomRiot said you have to subclass UITableViewCell so that when in editing mode you show the button you want on the left, outside the cell.</p>

<p>But first things first.
To change the indentation level for your cells all you need to do is implement this delegate method for the UITableView</p>

<pre><code>- (NSInteger)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView indentationLevelForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath
</code></pre>

<p>So that takes care of it. Then in your UITableViewCell subclass all I would do is to implement the method</p>

<pre><code>- (void)setEditing:(BOOL)editing animated:(BOOL)animated {
</code></pre>

<p>which I assume is called when the table the cell belongs to has changed to editing mode.
There I would fade in (or animate in any way you want) a button to appear on the left of your cell. 
I have done it inside a grouped-style cell but never on the outside.
Give it a try!</p>

"3087385","<p>So, I've got a webapp that lets users submit code. The submissions are stored in the <code>code</code> table, and a couple of columns of that are Fulltext-Indexed. This is how I have been performing searches up until now.</p>

<p>But, users can submit their submissions with as many tags as they like - and I'd like these to be included in the search too (but, all in one query...). The tags are stored in the table <code>tags</code>, and there's an intersection table called <code>code_tags</code> that stores the <code>code_id</code> and the <code>tag_id</code>. Standard stuff.</p>

<p>My 'old' search query was this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
  FROM code
 WHERE MATCH (title, summary, code) AGAINST ('$searchterm')
</code></pre>

<p><code>$searchterm</code> was fetched via PHP $_POST.</p>

<p>So I tried to write a bit more of an 'advanced' query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT code.*, 
       code_tags.*, 
       tags.*, 
       tags.tag
  FROM code, code_tags, tags
 WHERE code_tags.code_id = code.id
   AND tags.id = code_tags.tag_id
   AND MATCH (title, summary, code) AGAINST ('$searchterm') 
</code></pre>

<p>But all this did was return... <em>nothing</em>. Even when a perfectly valid search term was entered.</p>

<p>So I commented out the last line:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT code.*, code_tags.*, tags.*, tags.tag
  FROM code, code_tags, tags
 WHERE code_tags.code_id = code.id
   AND tags.id = code_tags.tag_id
-- AND MATCH (title, summary, code) AGAINST ('php') 
</code></pre>

<p>This returns every submission in the database. But, the same row is repeated as many times as there are tags for it (the only difference being, the tag in each returned row). </p>

<p>E.G: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/0NjQy.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/0NjQy.png"" alt=""Query Fail""></a>
</p>

<p>So, <strong>finally</strong>, I thought I'd be clever and GROUP_CONCAT the tags:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT code.*, code_tags.*, tags.*, GROUP_CONCAT(tags.tag SEPARATOR ' ') AS taggroup
  FROM code, code_tags, tags
 WHERE code_tags.code_id = code.id
   AND tags.id = code_tags.tag_id
-- AND MATCH (title, summary, code, taggroup) AGAINST ('php')`
</code></pre>

<p>There are two pretty big problems with this.</p>

<ol>
<li>With the last <code>AND MATCH</code> line commented out, only one row is returned (with all the details of the first entry in the <code>code</code> table - and taggroup lists every tag, for every submission!</li>
<li>With the last <code>AND MATCH</code> line included, I get the following error: <code>Unknown column 'taggroup' in 'where clause'</code> - damn!</li>
</ol>

<p>...doesn't return any results is that you don't have any <code>code</code> table records whose title/summary/code match ""php"" AND have relations to either the <code>CODE_TAGS</code> or <code>TAGS</code> tables.  Switching to ANSI-92 JOIN syntax, try:</p>

<p>then just use a standard row layout for the list row:</p>

</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>I then set the background in the custom list adapter getView() method as the top &amp; bottom rows render differently from the middle rows.</p>

<pre><code>if(position == 0)
        {
            holder.contentLayout.setBackgroundResource(R.drawable.top_row);

Figure below depicts distribution of some elements of<code>E</code>in the circle, where for example <code>E1=10, E2=35,...,E6=100, E7=91</code>.

I have forgotten to mention that in this figure <em>object</em> element which is in the center is the object based on which we are showing distribution. If element matches <em>object</em> with more percentage so close it to the <em>object</em> and vice versa.

"3096707","<p>I'm creating a program that uses SharePoint Web Services to query and show a Sharepoint list to the user. I can only show one column at a time, so I need to find a 'default column' or 'display column' to show. I know 'Title' is commonly used in many of the content types but I want this to be robust with any type of custom content type or list so I would like to find some way of querying the list to discover this field.</p>

<p>For example: I'm using SharePoint Manager 2010 here and looking at a Link Library (That doesn't have a Title field) but somehow it knows that the list item is called '<a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://google.com</a>'. How is it inferring this?

<p>If you look at the figure, there is a panel whose class name is ""#32770"" and Window Caption is ""Sign In Dialogue""</p>

<p>When the user is offline then this panel is visible, and when the user goes online the panel is not visible.</p>

<p>So the main logic is to detect the visibility of the panel.</p>

<li>Library strucchange for the function Wave() with which you build an object that will plot nicely</li>
</ul>

<p>Considering your comment about losing information if you apply a fourier-transform on the 3 dimensions separately instead of, say, on the vector for each point in time: You will lose information anyway in the fourier-transform. The best you can do is make sure the axes are orthogonal. Looking at your data, even running the fourier over only one dimension will give you the major frequency without problems.</p>

"3100807","<p>I have recently started using doc-view in Emacs, but I am having quite a few problems with it. The main one is that I can't scroll down on pages. I can see the next or previous page using ""n"" or ""p"", but the commands to scroll up and down a page, which are supposedly SPACE and DEL, do not work. Well, to be fair, DEL works, but it goes to the previous page rather than scroll up to the bottom of the previous page. The result is that I can only see the top of the pdf pages, but not the bottom parts. </p>

<p>I tried changing the view to continuous, but that doesn't work either. This is what I tried changing:</p>

<p><img src=""https://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1885087/docview.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I did check the customisations for doc-view, but the variables (or options, or whatever they are called) did not appear to me to be the ones which would solve my problem.</p>

<p>More information: I did manage to make SPACE and DEL work at some point, but I don't remember what I did, and I can't get it to work again. I am using Aquamacs.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>By the way, another problem I have is that doc-view causes Aquamacs to sort of crash, meaning it freezes everything, keeps ""thinking"", and I have to force quit Aquamacs to get it to work again. While this is not my main question, if anyone can tell me anything about this I would also appreciate.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I tried what the answer below suggested, it didn't work, kept trying other things/commands, and then C-n and SPACE started working! I quit Aquamacs, started it again, opened a pdf document, and it is back to not working. Can someone please explain what is happening? How can I make this reliable? </p>

"3108011","<p>I'm using one of my MySQL database tables as an actual table, with times of the day as each column, and one column called day. You guessed it, in day it says the day of the week, and in the rest of the cells it says what is happening at that time.</p>

<p>What I want to do is only show the cells that have value in it. In my case, I'm always going to have all the rows and 2 columns full. The 2 columns are 'day' and '19:00', however in the future I might add values for '18:00' etc.</p>

"3108495","<p>I'm working on a web application, and it's getting to the point where I've got most of the necessary features and I'm starting to worry about execution speed. So I did some hunting around for information and I found a lot about reducing page load times by minifying CSS/JS, setting cache control headers, using separate domains for static files, compressing the output, and so on (as well as basic server-side techniques like memcached). But let's say I've already optimized the heck out of all that and I'm concerned with how long it actually takes my web app to generate a page, i.e. the pure server-side processing time with no cache hits. Obviously the tricks for bringing that time down will depend on the language and underlying libraries I'm using, but what's a reasonable number to aim for? For comparison, I'd be interested in real-world examples of processing times for apps built with existing frameworks, doing typical things like accessing a database and rendering templates.</p>
<p>I stuck in a little bit of code to measure the processing time (or at least the part of it that happens within the code I wrote) and I'm generally seeing values in the range 50-150ms, which seems pretty high.  I'm interested to know how much I should focus on bringing that down, or whether my whole approach to this app is too slow and I should just give it up and try something simpler. (Based on the Net tab of Firebug, the parts of processing that I'm not measuring typically add less than 5ms, given that I'm testing with both client and server on the same computer.)</p>
<p>FYI I'm working in Python, using Werkzeug and SQLAlchemy/Elixir. I know those aren't the most efficient technologies out there but I'm really only concerned with being fast enough, not as fast as possible.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Just to clarify, the 50-150ms I quoted above is pure server-side processing time, <em>just</em> for the HTML page itself. The actual time it takes for the page to load, as seen by the user, is at least 200ms <em>higher</em> (so, 250-350ms total) because of the access times for CSS/JS/images (although I know that can be improved with proper use of caching and <code>Expires</code> headers, sprites, etc. which is something I will do in the near future). Network latency will add even more time on top of that, so we're probably talking about 500ms for the total client load time.</p>
<p>Better yet, here's a screenshot from the Net tab of Firebug for a typical example:
<a href=""http://www.ellipsix.net/ext-tmp/loadtimes.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/GVxYT.png"" alt=""Loading times from Firebug"" /></a>
It's the 74ms at the top that I'm asking about.</p>
","What is an appropriate page processing time for a web application?","<performance><timing>","2010-06-24 09:02:10","2419","3108629","4","<p>IMHO, 50-150 ms on client side on server side is fine in most circumstances. When I measure the speed of some very known websites, I rarely see something as fast. Most of the times, it is about 250 ms, often higher.</p>

<p>Now, I want to underline three points.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Everything depends on the context. A home page or a page which will be accessed very frequently will suck a lot if it takes seconds to load. On the other hand, some rarely used parts of the website can take up to one second if optimizations are to expensive.</p></li>
<li><p>The major concern of the users is to accomplish what they want quickly. It's not about the time taken to <em>access a single page</em>, but rather the time to <em>access information</em> or to <em>accomplish a goal</em>. That means that it's better to have one page taking 250 ms than requiring the user to visit three pages one after another to do the same thing, each one taking 150 ms to load.</p></li>
<li><p>Be aware of the perceived load time. For example, there is an interesting trick used on Stack Overflow website. When doing something which is based on AJAX, like up/down-voting, <em>first</em> you see the effect, then the request is made to the server. For example, try to up-vote your own message. It will show you that the message is up-voted (the arrow will become orange), <em>then</em>, 200 ms later, the arrow will become gray and an error box will be displayed. So in the case of an up-vote, the <em>perceived load time</em> (arrow becomes orange) is 1 ms, when the real load time spent doing the request is 100 ms.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><em>EDIT:</em> 200 ms is fine too. 500 ms will probably hurt a little if the page is accessed frequently or if the user <em>expects</em> the page to be fast (for example, AJAX requests are <em>expected</em> to be fast). By the way, I see on the screenshot that you are using several CSS files and ten PNG images. By <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=combine+css"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">combining CSS</a> into one file and using <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=css+sprites"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CSS sprites</a>, you can probably reduce the perceived load time, especially when dealing with network latency.</p>

<p>SWT (Beginning with 3.6 which just went gold) has a TaskBar class and corresponding TaskItem classes for each item in the TaskBar.  I don't think the TaskItem class is going to be powerful enough to do what you are asking for, but by looking at the source it will provide you insight into the low level Windows calls that you can access to get this done.</p>

<p>The SWT version for Windows will have a low level platform specific API that should get you where you want to go.  Basically they have done all the JNA/JNI work for you.  I am not a Windows programmer so I can't give you more details, but hopefully this will point you in the right direction.</p>

It was located in a tab called 'Markers' in pane found at the bottom of the Eclipse window.

"3113670","<p>I need to limit an angle so it fits into a segment. I have drawn and links to a diagram below to better describe what I am after.</p>

<p>I am trying to calculate this for a computer program, where I have an angle (<em>slope</em>), and a point (the mouse pointer). The distance does not matter to me, just the angles. If the point is within <em>b1</em> (green area) then that's fine. But if the point is within <em>b2</em> or <em>b3</em> (red or orange) areas, then the angle should snap back to the limit of the green area (along the line <em>s</em>).</p>

<p>The main problem I am having in figuring this out, is snapping the angle to the correct side e.g. If the point is in the red area, then the angle should snap to the angle s on the red side and vice versa.</p>

<p>I am also having trouble because <em>s</em> could be any angle, so I am being tripped up because I can't just do something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>if <em>a</em>(radians) is greater than
  <em>s</em>(radians) then set <em>a</em> to the value of <em>s</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>or I will get errors when the angle goes between zero and 2Pi.</p>

<p>So How would I work this out? Do I have to rotate everything back to a zero point or something then put it back when I have made my calculations?</p>

<p>Now to add the Spring libraries, open the Maven build file - pom.xml - and insert a new dependency on the Spring MVC framework:</p>

<pre><code>   &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-webmvc&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;3.0.0.RELEASE&lt;/version&gt;

<p>From here, you can follow the <a href=""http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Spring MVC reference documentation</a> - add the Dispatcher Servlet and Context Listener to web.xml, a Spring XML context and so on.</p>

<p>Something else you might find useful is the <a href=""http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Maven+Jetty+Plugin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Maven Jetty plugin</a>. Once configured, you can run your app by simply typing ""mvn jetty:run"" at the command prompt (or launching it from within the IDE). Maven will fetch all that's required and deploy the app for you, no need for an external app server setup for quick testing.</p>

"3119739","<p>I know that <code>length(x)</code> returns <code>max(size(x))</code> and <code>numel(x)</code> returns the total number of elements of x, but which is better for a 1 by n array? Does it matter, or are they interchangeable in this case? </p>

In term of performance, it depends on the inner working of arrays in MATLAB. E.g. if there are metainformations about how many elements are in the array (no matter the shape), then numel is as fast as possible, while max(size(x)) seems to need more work to obtain the same thing (retrieving sizes, and then finding the max among those). I am used to use <code>numel</code> in that case, but performance speech (hypothetical) apart, I would say they are interchangeable.</p>

                   totdist = sample(unlist(iris),800,replace = TRUE))
</code></pre>

<p>Next, add a variable to distinguish between treatment and control (i.e. <code>""Treatment2""</code> is recoded as <code>""Treatment""</code>, etc.)</p>

<pre><code>Data$groupname2 &lt;- factor(gsub('[1-9]','',as.character(Data$groupname)))
</code></pre>

<p>Then rearrange the data-set so that each treatment group is given a copy of the control data</p>

<pre><code>Data2 &lt;- NULL
for(treat in paste('Treatment',1:7,sep='')){
  Data2 &lt;- rbind(Data2,

<p>I understand that I'm missing a key concept somewhere... My brain goes crazy when I try tracking the flow of execution...<br />
Am I right by saying that by finding the longest path among the root, its left &amp; right nodes and then recurse on its left &amp; right nodes passing them the longest path from previous method invocation and finally (when?) return the longest path, I'm not certain as to how you go about returning it...</p>
","Longest path between 2 Nodes","<java><algorithm><recursion><binary-tree>","2010-06-26 16:18:00","17855","3124575","9","<p>Maybe it is just as simple:</p>

        return longestPath(n, 0); // forgot return?

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Its more complicated than one might think at first sight. Consider the following tree:</p>

<pre><code>      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \
  4   5
 / \   \
6   7   8
   / \   \
  9   a   b
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, the root node is not even in the longest path (<code>a-7-4-2-5-8-b</code>).</p>

<p>So, what you must do is the following: For each node <code>n</code> you must compute the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>compute longest path in left subtree starting with the root of the left subtree (called <code>L</code>)</li>
<li>compute longest path in right subtree starting with the root of the right subtree (called <code>R</code>)</li>
<li>compute the longest path in left subtree (not necessarily starting with the root of the left subtree) (called <code>l</code>)</li>
<li>compute the longest path in right subtree (not necessarily starting with the root of the right subtree) (called <code>r</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, decide, which combination maximizes path length:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>L+R+2</code>, i.e. going from a subpath in left subtree to current node and from current node through a subpath in right subtree</li>
<li><code>l</code>, i.e. just take the left subtree and exclude the current node (and thus right subtree) from path</li>
<li><code>r</code>, i.e. just take the right subtree and exclude the current node (and thus left subtree) from path</li>
</ul>

<p>So I would do a little hack and for every node not return just a single <code>int</code>, but a triple of integers containing <code>(L+R+2, l, r)</code>. The caller then must decide what to do with this result according to the above rules.</p>

"3126490","<p>I've got a peer to peer iPhone game working pretty well. I've created a table to display available peers and I can connect (so far) up to four devices and play a full round of a game from start to finish:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/4mg6S.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/4mg6S.png"" alt=""peer picker""></a>
</p>

<p>But here's my problem...</p>

<p>I create a <code>GKSession</code> on one device with <code>GKSessionModeClient</code> and the other with <code>GKSessionModeServer</code>. The client sees the server, selects to connect it, then the server approves. The server then can tap ""start game"" when all the peers are connected.</p>

<p>If--before the server starts the game-- the client taps the ""back"" button to go to the previous screen, the custom peer picker display is popped from the view and the session is ""destroyed""...</p>

<pre><code>[_gkSession disconnectFromAllPeers];
[_gkSession setAvailable:NO];
[_gkSession setDelegate:nil];
[_gkSession setDataReceiveHandler:nil withContext:nil];
</code></pre>

<p>now, if the client goes back to the peer picker and joins the server again, I get a <code>GKSessionStateConnected</code> state again, but when I <code>sendDataToAllPeers:</code> nothing reaches the client. It works flawlessly if one device starts a game and three devices join and then the server taps ""start game"". But if someone quits out before the game starts, then recreating a session and joining fails. </p>

<p>Any ideas? My only hack I can think of at this point is preventing a user from tapping ""back"" once they connect to a server, but that kind of sucks...they'd have to quit the app completely if they changed their mind. I'm at my wits end with this one as the app is running as well as I like it except for this connection issue. Kind of an edge case but I can see a user being annoyed if they can't start a game without having to restart the application to get the sessions cleared.</p>

<p>Will make this a bounty when I can. Please help!</p>

<p><strong>Edit @byteclub</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Does the server clean up all of the relevant data structures correctly if

  </ul>

<p>If the client leaves the game lobby after the server accepts their connection, the client's session is destroyed:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)destroySession
{
    trace(@""destroySession"");

    self.gameDelegate = nil;
    self.lobbyDelegate = nil;

    [_gkSession disconnectFromAllPeers];

    [_gkSession setDelegate:nil];
    [_gkSession setDataReceiveHandler:nil withContext:nil];

    [_peerList removeAllObjects];
}

<p>I do not call any disconnectFromPeers methods on the server device though.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>* Is the client-disconnect-cleanup procedure different for cases when the

</blockquote>

<p>Slightly, if a client disconnects then everyone receives a ""peer quit"" notification and the game ends. I don't worry about reconnecting in this case. It's mainly in the game lobby where the client can ""Cancel"" to go back to the home screen where the problem is. The client's session is destroyed in this case. If they then go back to the lobby and a <em>new</em> GKSession is alloc'ed, they can connect to the server still, but sendDataToAllPeers no longer works once they are connected.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>* Do you still have a problem if, before reconnecting, you restart the

<p>The client can reconnect in any case. I can quit, go back, restart the app and reconnect no problem. Just sendDataToPeers fails unless the server <em>and</em> client are both restarted.</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>* Do you completely destroy GKSession object on the client side

<p>Yes. (see code above)</p>

<p>You can see from a pic ""group1"" is an object, you can double click on it, when you delete it, it gets deleted the whole text not just a part of it.
I made some research and this text field is just a simple <code>RichEdit20W</code>. I understand that I can do it by implementing some logic to a text field and so on, but it will not be proper way of doing it.
I wonder how they done that. Should I implement <code>IRichEditOleCallback</code> interface to achieve that? I will appreciate your answer very much.
Thanks!</p>

<p>How can I solve this problem?</p>

This is one way to implement polymorphic associations, since a given foreign key can reference only one target table. </p>

<p>Another solution is to make a common ""supertable"" that both <code>users</code> and <code>schools</code> references, and then use that as the parent of <code>sets</code>.</p>

<pre><code>create table set_owner

create table users 
  PK is also FK --&gt; set_owner

create table schools
  PK is also FK --&gt; set_owner

create table sets 
  FK --&gt; set_owner
</code></pre>

<p>You can think of this as analogous to an <em>interface</em> in OO modeling:</p>

<pre><code>interface SetOwner { ... }

class User implements SetOwner { ... }

class School implements SetOwner { ... }

class Set {
  SetOwner owner;
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Re your comments:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the SetOwner table contains both UserIDs and SchoolIDs, correct? That would mean that I wouldn't be allowed to have the same ID for an user and a school. How can I enforce this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let the SetOwners table generate id values.  You have to insert into SetOwners before you can insert into either Users or Schools.  So make the id's in Users and Schools <em>not</em> auto-incrementing; just use the value that was generated by SetOwners:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO SetOwners DEFAULT VALUES; -- generates an id
INSERT INTO Schools (id, name, location) VALUES (LAST_INSERT_ID(), 'name', 'location');
</code></pre>

<p>This way no given id value will be used for both a school and a user.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If I'd like to get the owner type for a set, do I need an ownerType attribute in my SetOwner table? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can certainly do this.  In fact, there may be other columns that are common to both Users and Schools, and you could put these columns in the supertable SetOwners.  This gets into Martin Fowler's <a href=""http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/classTableInheritance.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">Class Table Inheritance</a> pattern.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And if I want to get the name of the school or the user (whichever type it is), can I do this with a single query, or do I need two queries (first to get the type and second to get the name)?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You need to do a join.  If you're querying from a given Set and you know it belongs to a user (not a school) you can skip joining to SetOwners and join directly to Users.  Joins don't necessarily have to go by foreign keys.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT u.name FROM Sets s JOIN Users u ON s.SetOwner_id = u.id WHERE ...
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't know whether a given set belongs to a User or a School, you'd have to do an outer join to both:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COALESCE(u.name, sc.name) AS name 
FROM Sets s 
LEFT OUTER JOIN Users u ON s.SetOwner_id = u.id
LEFT OUTER JOIN Schools sc ON s.SetOwner_id = sc.id 
WHERE ...

<p>You know that the SetOwner_id must match one or the other table, Users or Schools, but not both.</p>

<p>First, you should be able to avoid the matrix inversion by changing the way you define the operator. Here's a blind stab at it:</p>

<pre><code>Matrix m;
m.Rotate(-rotation);
m.Translate(-pA.X, -pA.Y);

<p>Now for the rotation itself, the usual way to do it is with a matrix that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>cos(theta)  -sin(theta)
sin(theta)   cos(theta)

<p>and you're calculating theta using atan(y/x). But if what you want are the sin and cos, you can just normalize x and y and use them directly:</p>

<pre><code>import scala.io._

def toInt(in: String): Option[Int] =
  try {
    Some(Integer.parseInt(in.trim))
  } catch {
    case e: NumberFormatException =&gt; None
  }

def sum(in: Seq[String]) = {
  val ints = in.flatMap(s =&gt; toInt(s))
  ints.foldLeft(0)((a, b) =&gt; a + b)
}

println(sum(List(""1"",""2"",""3"")))
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore, the problem must lie somewhere in the lines to follow. I think the main culprit is what Ctrl-C actually does on Windows combined with how the Scala interpreter runs your scripts. The last line of the screenshot you have attached to the question was the starting point. It suggests that somewhere, a batch job is running and the Ctrl-C has sent a signal to kill that batch job. This is actually none other than the scala interpreter itself (<code>scala.bat</code>). Therefore, when you press Ctrl-C, instead of just killing the input stream, you send a signal to kill the whole batch job running your program!</p>

<p>So the error has something to do with this action. I've looked at how <code>scala</code> runs your script. It seems that a folder named <code>scalascriptXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</code> (where XX... represent 19 pseudorandom digits) is created in <code>%TEMP%</code> where all the compiled stuff needed is placed. There, a file called <code>Main$$anon$1$$anonfun$1.class</code> is created -- this represents the anonymous function that is passed to the <code>flatMap</code> function. It seems that this file is created in parallel with the running of the program. Therefore, if you kill your process before it has a chance to do this compilation, you will get the <code>ClassNotFoundException</code>. </p>

<p>Now, it's quite strange that you get this error <em>all the time</em> you run your script. I have managed to get it occasionally. Always though, as soon as I press Ctrl-C I get the <code>Terminate batch job (Y/N)?</code> prompt. Sometimes it is accompanied with an exception. Sometimes not. I think it again has to do with the creation of the <code>Main$$anon$1$$anonfun$1.class</code>. If I wait a while, I get no exception. If I press Ctrl-C straight away after start, I get the exception. </p>

<p>After quite a lot of runs I managed to get a complete stack trace(I think... as the Ctrl-C stops the stack trace from being dumped as well), pointing to the main culprit -- a <code>FileNotFoundException</code>. </p>

"3149568","<p>When developing a Win32 Application (non-console application) in Visual Studio 2005, is there any way to get the same sort of output as you do from the console?</p>

<p>For instance, say I want to see log statements (such as I would with cout in a console application) to trace the path my program has taken in the code.</p>

<p>My first thought would be that this could be done through the Output tab selecting something from its ""Show output from:"" dropdown, when debugging but I don't know what API I need to do this...</p>

But, the general principal would be to increase the bounds you're checking against. For example, if your shapes are circles of radius n, when checking collisions you could use a radius of n + 2. Note that you're still drawing the circle using a radius of n. You just use the increased radius for collision detection. </p>

<p>The reason the UILabel is being flipped is that we host the Core Plot graphs within a UIView that inverts its layer's coordinate system.  This is done to preserve the same coordinate system between Mac and iPhone for the framework (based on the normal Quartz coordinate system where 0,0 is the bottom left).</p>

<p>Instead of adding a UILabel to the graph, you could directly add a CPTextLayer to the graph layer (or one of the other layers in the display hierarchy).  CPTextLayers play within the standard coordinate space of the Core Plot graphs, so they should render properly.</p>

"3157766","<p>I'm new to QT. I'm using PyQT for GUI development in my project. I want to achieve this layout in my application. This application searches images from an image database. Google image search layout is ideal for my purpose.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/uKeaN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/uKeaN.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>I'm following the book ""Rapid GUI Programming with Python and Qt"" and I'm familiar with layouts.  I guess I need to use a grid layout with each result image in each box of grid. &amp; use vertical layout for (image,Qlabel,Qlabel) inside each grid box.</p>

<p>These are some problems I'm facing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Importantly, I'm unable to display image. What control/widget do I need? I cannot find anything similar to PictureBox of .NET</p></li>
<li><p>How do I seperate these image result by fixed gap like in the image? I'm using Horizontal &amp; vertical spacers but that isn't working?</p></li>
<li><p>How to set QLabel a clickable (like hyperlink). I don't want to a open a URL. Just the text should be clickable. So, that when user clicks on the link. I can show more information (like next set of results when he clicks on next page number or a new window with image in fullsize when user clicks on 'view') Do we have some new kind of control for this?</p></li>
<li><p>This is another important issue. I'll display the page numbers of results (like shown in figure) &amp; assuming they are clickable. How do I load a new <code>page</code> of results? I mean what is the equivalent of <code>page</code> in QT?</p></li>
<li><p>As you can guess. This definitely wont be the first page of GUI. The first page will be exactly like <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://google.com</a> (a big logo &amp; text box with button  below it). when user clicks the search button. This page will be displayed. Again the same question comes up. How change the pages?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Please give a list of controls I'm going to need for this. Tell me if I'm unaware of something.</p>

For displaying the images and labels use a <a href=""https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qlistwidgetitem.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">QListWidget</a> with view mode set to QListView::IconMode. However, if you need to customize the display beyond what the QListWidget/QListWidgetItem api can provide you will need to create your own <a href=""https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qabstractlistmodel.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">QAbstractListModel</a> and use a standard QListView with it.
Make sure and read <a href=""https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/model-view-programming.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Qt's primer on model/view</a>.</p>

<p>As for spacing the images, checkout the <a href=""https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qlistview.html#spacing-prop"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">spacing property</a> on the list view.</p>

<p>Here is an example from KDE's Dolphin file manager:
<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/Bv6OF.png"" alt=""Dolphin&#39;s icon mode""></p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Use a regular QLabel, but set the contents to be an href.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p><em>edit: Oops I see from your tags you are using PyQt, the following is C++, but should be similar to what you would do in python.</em></p>

<pre><code>  QLabel *linkLabel = new QLabel;
  linkLabel-&gt;setTextFormat( Qt::RichText )
  linkLabel-&gt;setText( ""&lt;a href=\""someurl\""&gt; Click me! &lt;/a&gt;"" );
  connect( linkLabel, SIGNAL( linkActivated ( const QString &amp; link ) ), .... )
</code></pre>

<p><strong>4.</strong>
Well, since you are using a Model/View, why bother having page numbers at all? The user will just be able to scroll the view and more pictures will be shown. This is by far the easiest solution as you don't have to do anything once you've got your M/V setup! </p>

<p>However, if you really want to show page numbers it will require more work in your model. For example, have a track the ""current page"" in the model and only allow access to images on the ""current page"". Then in your slot connected to the linkActivated() signal tell the model to change pages. I won't go into much more detail as this seriously violates the whole idea behind model/view. The ""right way"" of doing this would be to subclass QListView and add pagination support, but like I said why not use scroll bars? There isn't any performance hits to doing so.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Use a <a href=""https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qstackedwidget.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">QStackedWidget</a>, addWidget() all your ""pages"" to it, then call setCurrentIndex/Widget() as needed to switch the pages.</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts</strong>:
It seems you are very committed to cloning the look, feel, and behavior of Google Image search, which is fine, but Google Image Search is a web application that uses interaction paradigms that are very different than a normal desktop application (links, pages, etc). You are presumably developing a desktop application, and by trying to emulate the behavior of a web app you will find it difficult as the API just isn't designed to support those sorts of interactions. By all means, it is doable, but you'll have your work cut out for you.</p>

<p>If you are extremely intent on sticking to the web based interaction style, why not code your app in javascript and HTML and toss it in a <a href=""https://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qwebview.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">QWebView</a>?</p>

"3160787","<p>I have an iPhone SDK project that is supposed to build a static library for both the simulator and the ARM processor and then combine the two into a universal library.</p>

<p>Heretofore, I was using iPhone SDK 3+ and accomplished this by creating a separate target for each, one simulator and one ARM, and then making a third target that combines them using a shell script. The deployment targets/build settings for each of the constituent targets are set to their respective architectures, etc. Also, iPhone SDK 3+ allowed me to select ""Base SDK"" from the drop down menu in the upper-left corner of the main XCode window.</p>

<p>Everything worked famously--then I upgraded to SDK 4.</p>

<p>Now, there is no ""Base SDK"" listing in the drop down menu in the upper-left. Also, the compiler seems to ignore the target deployment settings entirely. Even though one of the targets is set to ""iPhone Device"" and the other is set to ""iPhone Simulator"", they still build as whatever is set in the drop down menu. </p>

<p>In case I've not been clear enough, here is the <strike>offensive</strike> offending aforementioned menu we all know and love:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/eW7Fw.png"" alt=""offending menu""></p>

<p>Once again, in SDK 3 everything worked perfectly. Now in SDK 4, if it's set to ""Device"" I get two libraries built for ARM. If it's set to simulator, I get two libraries built for  the simulator.</p>

<p>Anybody know of a workaround for this bullhonkey?</p>

<p>Thanks much.</p>

<p>UPDATE: the ""xcodebuild"" command line tool still works, that is to say it will build the correct architecture according to each target's deployment parameters.</p>

<p>Thus, rather than using XCode's GUI to build, I can use a shell script that calls xcodebuild like so:</p>

<pre>
xcodebuild -target device-target -configuration Debug
xcodebuild -target sim-target -configuration Debug

","Install Xcode 3.2.3 w/ iPhone SDK 4, get ""Base SDK missing"", can't see other SDKs","<iphone><xcode><ios4>","2010-07-01 20:22:55","78565","3161502","4","<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>I'm going to explain why this is going on, and then how fix the specific ""Base SDK Missing"" problem. You can skip to the bottom for just the fix, though I recommend reading all of this. I also recommend John Muchow's excellent <a href=""http://iphonedevelopertips.com/xcode/base-sdk-and-iphone-os-deployment-target-developing-apps-with-the-4-x-sdk-deploying-to-3-x-devices.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">take</a> on this issue. </p>

<p>If you are specifically interested in the Xcode 3.2.4 upgrade, which has a strongly related problem, you might want to confer <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3677487"">here</a>.</p>

<h1>One SDK to rule them all</h1>

<p>Here's the deal: 4.0 is now the only SDK version allowed for submitting
new or updated iPhone-only apps. This is direct from Apple's <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/checklist/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">iOS 4
Readiness Checklist</a> (reg reqd):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All new applications and updates to existing applications must 
  be built with iPhone SDK 4. Please note, the App Store will no 
  longer support applications that target iOS 2.x.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Presumably -- I'm guessing here -- iPad-only and universal apps
should use the 3.2 SDK. <strong>That</strong> is why 4.0 &amp; 3.2 are your only choices for SDKs.</p>

<p>That is also why your project is now broken, since the SDK it was previously mapped to is <strong>deprecated</strong>, gones-ville. </p>

<h1>(But) 3 is a magic number</h1>

<p>Relax. You can still target devices running iPhone OS 3.0 (but not lower).
The SDK you use <strong>to compile</strong> does not limit -- <strong>downward</strong> -- what iOS version
you can program to or support. Once you've patched things up in your project etc. (cf. next section) you can set ""iPhone OS Deployment Target"" to a lower iOS version. For a quick shot of how to do this, cf. step 7 in the next section. </p>

<p>Note that you are now entering some tricky terrain. Your usual Xcode 3.2.3 compiler will no longer be enforcing your compliance to 3.0-only calls, nor does it have a simulator for these. And if you want to support 4.0 features, you'll have to do some conditional code to prevent crashes on 3.0 devices. Fun. </p>

<p>You can still download (from Apple!) and install a previous Xcode version or SDK (cf. <a href=""http://chris-fletcher.com/2010/08/28/howto-install-iphone-sdk-2-0-3-1-for-xcode-3-2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>). Yes, you can install multiple Xcode versions, in different directories, i.e. put only one version in /Developer. You can use the old Xcode to test your app's compliance vs. a 3.x SDK, moving the hard work to a fancy compiler, and simulator. But you can no longer use the products of the previous SDKs to submit to the app store. </p>

<p>FWIW, I plan on doing just this check before I ship.</p>

<h1>What condition my condition is in</h1>

<p>Matt Gallagher has a Cocoa with Love post on version conditional code entitled <a href=""http://cocoawithlove.com/2010/07/tips-tricks-for-conditional-ios3-ios32.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">""Tips &amp; Tricks for conditional iOS3, iOS3.2 and iOS4 code""</a>. If you are planning on conditionally using 4.0 features, this is a strong recommendation to check it out.</p>

<h1>Fixing ""Base SDK Missing""</h1>

<ol>
<li>Load your project</li>
<li>From the menu, select Project > Edit Project Settings...</li>
<li>Under Architecture > Base SDK, choose one of the available device
options: iPhone 3.2 or iPhone 4.0. If you are iPhone-only, 4.0 is the way to go.</li>
<li>Close that window.</li>
<li>From the menu, select Project > Edit Active Target ""YourTarget""</li>
<li>Under Architecture > Base SDK, choose one of the available device
or simulator options: iPhone 3.2 or iPhone 4.0.</li>
<li>If you want to target previous iOS versions, then in that same
window, under Deployment > iPhone OS Deployment Target, select the
lowest version you want to support. Note that support for 2.x versions
through the app store is deprecated. See the ""Readiness Checklist"" quote above.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Base SDK location for Xcode 4 and above</h1>

<p>As shown in the picture above, if you have a textbox with padding, the initial cursor size at least on my Mac is the full specified height with padding. Of course, when you start typing, it goes back to normal text sizes (see that 'Password' watermark).</p>

<p>Is there a way to make the initial cursor the right size, aside from simply resizing the actual textbox? (It works on Webkit browsers fine.)</p>

"3164023","<p>I can understand that WCF is in general better than Remoting, but the two seem quite different to me. MS make this pretty picture to show how great WCF is (or perhaps how poor the other techs are to only check one box each):

<sub>(source: <a href=""http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC371617.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">microsoft.com</a>)</sub>  </p>

<p>But, WCF is centered around SOA and I don't think it's correct to assume every networked application <em>wants</em> to expose services.</p>

<p>In my case I'm looking at ways to replicate objects between two instances of a server application  on different PCs. WCF appears to just give a modern version of COM... get an object and call methods and it magically calls the version on the other PC. But Remoting appeared to do something quite different and I'm not clear why it was deprecated without being replaced with a similar technology.</p>

<p>So, do MS even claim Remoting is dead? Or do they still support it, acknowledging it has its place <em>alongside</em> WCF?</p>
","Does WCF really replace .NET Remoting?","<c#><wcf>","2010-07-02 07:45:01","9795","3164046","1","<p>It really does replace .Net remoting. You can use a binary formatter with a Tcp channel and get the same experience as remoting.</p>

<p>For your case, remoting doesn't really seem to be the right choice. If you want to replicate objects, as in make copies of them in a different location, then you want to serialize them and send them as a bundle (a ""message"" in WCF lingo) to be loaded into a type (could be the same type in the same assembly, but deployed on a different server) on the remote endpoint. This is where WCF excels. Remoting would give you a connection to a ""live"" object from one endpoint to the other. </p>

"3165346","<p>Using position_jitter creates random jitter to prevent overplotting of data points.</p>

<p>In the below I have used the example of baseball statistics to illustrate my problem. When I plot the same data with two layers, the same jitter call jitters the geoms a bit differently.
This makes sense because it presumably generates the random jitter independently in the two calls, but yields the problem you can see in my graph below.</p>

<pre><code>p=ggplot(baseball,aes(x=round(year,-1),y=sb,color=factor(lg))) 
p=p+stat_summary(fun.data=""mean_cl_normal"",position=position_jitter(width=3,height=0))+coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,40))
p+stat_summary(fun.y=mean,geom=""line"",position=position_jitter(width=3,height=0))
</code></pre>

<p>Although the error bar points and the line refer to same data, they are disjointed—the lines and points do not connect.</p>

<p>Is there a work-around for this? I thought position dodge might be the answer but it doesn't seem to work with these kinds of plots. Alternatively, maybe there's some way to get the mean_cl_normal call to also add the lines?

<p>if you call <code>position_jitter</code> you'll see it returns a ggproto object with a consistent seed.</p>

"3167822","<p>I'm very new to iPhone development so please bear with me.

The problem is (and this is a problem I've had with all tutorials I've attempted to follow) that when I create the application with a subview inside the window, the subview itself is shifted up approximately 20px. </p>

<p>This picture is taken from Apple and shows what the application should look like:

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/hObiA.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/hObiA.png"" alt=""My simulator""></a>
</p>

<p>Has anybody experienced this before/have any suggestions? I'm not trying to do anything complicated and I have a feeling it's just something simple.</p>

<p>The code for my <code>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions</code> method is:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {    

    // Override point for customization after application launch.

    MyViewController *mvc = [[MyViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@""MyViewController"" bundle:[NSBundle mainBundle]];
    self.myViewController = mvc;
    [mvc release];

    [window addSubview:[self.myViewController view]];
    [window makeKeyAndVisible];

    return YES;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>MyViewController</code> is nothing more than what is created by Xcode when you create the file. </p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> Is there a way to simply shift the view down?  I'm thinking that maybe the view is the correct size, it's simply shifted up behind the status bar.  </p>

"3172304","<p>I recently published my first MVC 2 project to a commercial web server, running Windows 2008, and which purportedly supports other MVC sites without issue, but have been experiencing some problems. Here is the high-level structure of the project. As you can see, it is very simple:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i6.photobucket.com/albums/y206/QuestmasterAzuth/directories.jpg"" /></p>

<p>But, after the site is published, and I navigate to the URL, I get ""HTTP Error 403.14 - Forbidden: The Web server is configured to not list the contents of this directory."" </p>

<p>So, I contacted the web host about it and was told I had to include a default landing page, such as Default.aspx, Index.aspx, etc. I doubted this response was accurate because I thought MVC Routing would have taken care of this, but I did as suggested anyway, adding a redirect to my home controller in the Default.aspx.cs codebehind, but got an HTTP Error 404. I added that redirect per advice similar to that found in this article: <a href=""http://www.58bits.com/blog/CommentView,guid,10b2ddfa-057c-41d0-bdc7-564b212ce896.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.58bits.com/blog/CommentView,guid,10b2ddfa-057c-41d0-bdc7-564b212ce896.aspx</a>.</p>

<p>I've been going back and forth with the web host about this for over a week, across about a dozen different responses and answers, yet I have not been able to find a resolution to this. I am <strong>sure</strong> this is a simple thing to resolve, but I have no idea what to try next, or what to suggest to the web hosting support that they try next. </p>

<p>Soooo ... knowing that the StackOverflow community is smarter than me and the support techs for my web hosting company combined, a thousand times over, I'm hoping you can help me work toward a resolution here, so I can successfully publish my project and access it without error. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Issue with the MVC libraries</h2>

<p><strong>The production server might not have the MVC libraries stored in the GAC.</strong> To fix this, all you have to do is go into your MVC project's <code>References</code> pane/folder and find <code>System.Web.Mvc</code>, <code>System.Web.Routing</code>, and <code>System.Web.Abstractions</code>. Now, select them by <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> clicking on them, and set Copy Local to true in the Properties window.</p>

<p>It's hard to know before you publish to a server whether or not this is the case, so I recommend just setting the assemblies to copy local all the time.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Landing Page</h2>

<p><strong>Your landing page may have issues.</strong> From my experience with ASP.NET MVC, I've seen that a landing page is required for IIS to function correctly. I'm using the page that was included in the ASP.NET MVC 2 template. You should compare mine to yours to see if you have everything that's needed:</p>

<p>Default.aspx:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Page Language=""C#"" AutoEventWireup=""true"" CodeBehind=""Default.aspx.cs"" Inherits=""YourNamespace._Default"" %&gt;

&lt;%-- Please do not delete this file. It is used to ensure that ASP.NET MVC is activated by IIS when a user makes a ""/"" request to the server. --%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Default.aspx.cs:</p>

<pre><code>using System.Web;
using System.Web.Mvc;
using System.Web.UI;

namespace YourNamespace
{
    public partial class _Default : Page
    {
        public void Page_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
        {
            // Change the current path so that the Routing handler can correctly interpret
            // the request, then restore the original path so that the OutputCache module
            // can correctly process the response (if caching is enabled).

            string originalPath = Request.Path;
            HttpContext.Current.RewritePath(Request.ApplicationPath, false);
            IHttpHandler httpHandler = new MvcHttpHandler();
            httpHandler.ProcessRequest(HttpContext.Current);
            HttpContext.Current.RewritePath(originalPath, false);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<h2>Permissions</h2>

<p>Based on the first HTTP status code you got, there may be a permissions problem. The <strong>folder containing your MVC application must be defined as an application and set to the appropriate permissions</strong>.</p>

<p>It's quite easy to do both those things through IIS. However, you probably don't have access to IIS; if you do, you're very lucky!</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can change the permissions through FTP using the <code>chmod</code> command. You can connect through Filezilla, a very good open-source FTP client, a just do it through a right-click + dialog box.</p>

<p>As for defining the folder as an application, you should check whether you can do it through any of the IIS things provided to you by the host. If not, contact them and ask them to set it up.</p>

<p>Hi all.</p>

<p>Yesterday I noticed that <code>Enumerable</code> LINQ exstensions are hidden on strings (I mean hidden from the intellisense).</p>

<p>We all know string is an <code>IEnumerable&lt;char&gt;</code>, so automatically it should get Enumerable extensions, and actually compiles and works if you use them, but why .NET developers decided to hide them from intellisense?</p>

<p>And lastly, how we can hide extension methods from a specific type ?</p>

sorry for my poor english...</p>

If what you've written earlier is useful in the context of what you're writing then cite it.

Simply saying “I did that before” and not telling where isn't good practice either.</p>

<p>Many researchers cite earlier works of themselves, especially if they improve on it or thinking ideas further. And those are for the most part also rather small names amidst the people they cite as well.</p>

","Using multiple cell style types and custom cells in a UITableView","<iphone><uitableview>","2010-07-05 13:36:51","7842","3180170","4","<p>The main layout is a grouped table. Each cluster of cells is a table section. The top most cell is set with a transparent background. </p>

<p>The key to making this work is to have a logical structure in the tableview delegate that understands which cell layout goes in which section and which row. A switch statement is usually easiest although you can also use arrays or dictionaries configure to reflect the layout. </p>

<p>So, in <code>tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> you would have something like:</p>

<pre><code>switch (indexPath.section) {
    case 0:
        cell= //configure cell with transparent background
        break;
    case 1:
        if (indexPath.row==0) {

<p>In this layout, the tableview is being used less as a logical table (which displays repeating units of list structured data) and more as convenient mechanism for managing a layout. The logic managing the tableview has to be more complex and reflect the needs of the layout. </p>

","iPhone paint app (glPaint based). Blending with white background","<iphone><objective-c><ipad><opengl-es>","2010-07-06 10:44:46","3302","3192152","1","<p>Let’s start by defining the type of blending you’re looking for. It sounds like you want your buffer to start out white and have your color mixing obey a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color"" rel=""noreferrer"">subtractive color model</a>. The easiest way to do that is to define the result of mixing <em>C<sub>brush</sub></em> over <em>C<sub>dst</sub></em> as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>C</em> = <em>C<sub>brush</sub></em> × <em>C<sub>dst</sub></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice that using this equation, the result of mixing yellow (1, 1, 0) and cyan (0, 1, 1) is green (0, 1, 0), which is what you’d expect.</p>

<p>Having a brush that fades at the edges complicates things slightly. Let’s say you now have a brush opacity value <em>A<sub>brush</sub></em>—where <em>A<sub>brush</sub></em> is 1, you want your brush color to blend at full strength, and where <em>A<sub>brush</sub></em> is 0, you want the original color to remain. Now what you're looking for is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>C</em> = (<em>C<sub>brush</sub></em> × <em>C<sub>dst</sub></em>) × <em>A<sub>brush</sub></em> + <em>C<sub>dst</sub></em> × (1 - <em>A<sub>brush</sub></em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since blending in OpenGL ES results computes <em>C</em> = <em>C<sub>src</sub></em> × <em>S</em> + <em>C<sub>dst</sub></em> × <em>D</em>, we can get exactly what we want if we make the following substitutions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>C<sub>src</sub></em> = <em>C<sub>brush</sub></em> × <em>A<sub>brush</sub></em></p>
  
  <p><em>A<sub>src</sub></em> = <em>A<sub>brush</sub></em></p>
  
  <p><em>S</em> = <em>C<sub>dst</sub></em></p>
  
  <p><em>D</em> = (1 - <em>A<sub>brush</sub></em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now let’s look at what it takes to set this up in OpenGL ES. There are 4 steps here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Change the background color to white.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Change the brush texture to an alpha texture.</strong><br>
By default, GLPaint creates its brush texture as an RGBA texture with the brush shape drawn in the RGB channels, which is somewhat unintuitive. For reasons you’ll see later, it’s useful to have the brush shape in the alpha channel instead. The best way to do this is by drawing the brush shape in grayscale with CG and creating the texture as <code>GL_ALPHA</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>CGColorSpaceRef brushColorSpace = CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceGray();
brushData = (GLubyte *) calloc(width * height, sizeof(GLubyte));
brushContext = CGBitmapContextCreate(brushData, width, width, 8, width, brushColorSpace, kCGImageAlphaNone);
CGColorSpaceRelease(brushColorSpace);
</code></pre>

<hr>

<pre><code>glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_ALPHA, width, height, 0, GL_ALPHA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, brushData);        
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Set up <em>C<sub>src</sub></em>, <em>A<sub>src</sub></em>, <em>S</em> and <em>D</em>.</strong><br>
After switching to an alpha texture, assuming that your brush color is still being specified via <code>glColor4f</code>, you’ll find that the default OpenGL ES texture environment will give you this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>C<sub>src</sub></em> = <em>C<sub>brush</sub></em></p>
  
  <p><em>A<sub>src</sub></em> = <em>A<sub>brush</sub></em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to obtain the extra multiplication by <em>A<sub>brush</sub></em> for <em>C<sub>src</sub></em>, you’ll need to set up a custom combiner function in the texture environment as follows (you can do this in the initialization function for <code>PaintingView</code>):</p>

<pre><code>glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL_COMBINE);
glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_OPERAND0_RGB, GL_SRC_ALPHA);
</code></pre>

<p>Changing <code>GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE</code> to <code>GL_COMBINE</code> gives you <em>C<sub>brush</sub></em> × 0 (to see why this is the case, read section 3.7.12 in the <a href=""http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/specs/1.1/es_full_spec_1.1.12.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">OpenGL ES 1.1 specification</a>). Changing <code>GL_OPERAND0_RGB</code> to <code>GL_SRC_ALPHA</code> changes the second term in the multiplication to what we want.</p>

<p>To set up <em>S</em> and <em>D</em>, all you need to do is change the blending factors (this can be done where the blending factors were set up before):</p>

<pre><code>glBlendFunc(GL_DST_COLOR, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA); 
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>Ensure that any modifications to <em>A<sub>brush</sub></em> outside of the brush texture are reflected across other channels.</strong><br>
The above modifications to the texture environment only take into account the part of the brush opacity that come from the brush texture. If you modify the brush opacity in the alpha channel elsewhere (i.e. by scaling it, as in <code>AppController</code>), you must make sure that you make the same modifications to the other three channels:</p>

<pre><code>glColor4f(components[0] * kBrushOpacity, components[1] * kBrushOpacity, components[2] * kBrushOpacity, kBrushOpacity);
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the downsides to implementing your brushes with a subtractive color model are that colors can only get darker, and repeatedly drawing the same color over itself can eventually result in a color shift if it’s not one of the primary subtractive colors (cyan, magenta, or yellow). If, after implementing this, you find that the color shifts are unacceptable, try changing the brush texture to an alpha texture as in step 2 and changing the blend factors as follows:</p>

<pre><code>glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you simple painting of your brush color over white, but no actual mixing of colors (the brush colors will eventually overwrite the background).</p>

"3190735","<p>I've been working through an ordered ManyToManyField widget, and have the front-end aspect of it working nicely:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/APMce.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/APMce.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I'm having a great deal of trouble getting the backend working. The obvious way to hook up the backend is to use a <code>through</code> table keyed off a model with <code>ForeignKey</code>s to both sides of the relationship and overwrite the save method. This would work great, except that due to idiosyncrasies of the content, it is an absolute requirement that this widget be placed in a fieldset (using the ModelAdmin <code>fieldsets</code> property), which is <a href=""https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/12237"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">apparently not possible</a>.</p>

<p>I'm out of ideas. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","Ordered ManyToManyField that can be used in fieldsets","<python><django><django-admin><manytomanyfield>","2010-07-06 22:37:58","3586","3236621","1","<p>In regard to how to set up the models, you're right in that a through table with an ""order"" column is the ideal way to represent it. You're also right in that Django will not let you refer to that relationship in a fieldset. The trick to cracking this problem is to remember that the field names you specify in the ""fieldsets"" or ""fields"" of a <code>ModelAdmin</code> do not actually refer to the fields of the <code>Model</code>, but to the fields of the <code>ModelForm</code>, which we are free to override to our heart's delight. With many2many fields, this gets tricky, but bear with me:</p>

<p>Let's say you're trying to represent contests and competitors that compete in them, with an ordered many2many between contests and competitors where the order represents the competitors' ranking in that contest. Your <code>models.py</code> would then look like this:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db import models

class Contest(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
    # More fields here, if you like.
    contestants = models.ManyToManyField('Contestant', through='ContestResults')

class Contestant(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)

class ContestResults(models.Model):
    contest = models.ForeignKey(Contest)
    contestant = models.ForeignKey(Contestant)
    rank = models.IntegerField()
</code></pre>

<p>Hopefully, this is similar to what you're dealing with. Now, for the admin. I've written an example <code>admin.py</code> with plenty of comments to explain what's happening, but here's a summary to help you along:</p>

<p>Since I don't have the code to the ordered m2m widget you've written, I've used a placeholder dummy widget that simply inherits from <code>TextInput</code>. The input holds a comma-separated list (without spaces) of contestant IDs, and the order of their appearance in the string determines the value of their ""rank"" column in the <code>ContestResults</code> model.</p>

<p>What happens is that we override the default <code>ModelForm</code> for Contest with our own, and then define a ""results"" field inside it (we can't call the field ""contestants"", since there would be a name conflict with the m2m field in the model). We then override <code>__init__()</code>, which is called when the form is displayed in the admin, so we can fetch any ContestResults that may have already been defined for the Contest, and use them to populate the widget. We also override <code>save()</code>, so that we can in turn get the data from the widget and create the needed ContestResults.</p>

<p>Note that for the sake of simplicity this example omits things like validation of the data from the widget, so things will break if you try to type in anything unexpected in the text input. Also, the code for creating the ContestResults is quite simplistic, and could be greatly improved upon.</p>

<p>I should also add that I've actually ran this code and verified that it works.</p>

        # saved in the DB and have a PK, before we can create ContestResults.
        # Fortunately, all models have a built-in method called save_m2m()

<p>This would have to be done on a per-pc basis.</p>

<p>In addition, there is no way to do this from an Excel file point of view as this would completely anihiliate the security feature of letting the user chose to run VBA code or not.</p>

<p>Also a little sidenote, if you sign your Excel file, you'd still need the recipient to trust you as a publisher, so that's why your solution probably did not work.</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>Taking into comments, there does seem to be a way to do it programmatically. As taken from XpertsExchange,</p>

<p>Why not just set the registry entry from code, without invoking Shell? Use the cRegistry class found here:</p>

        .Value = ""Full path to Trusted Folder""

<p>The only caveat is that YourTrustedLocationname must be unique ... </p>

<p>You'd have to try if it should be .ValueType = REG_DWORD or REG_SZ. I'm not sure on that one.</p>

"3205665","<p>I have a texture loaded into memory that is of RGBA format with various alpha values.</p>

<p>The image is loaded as so:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I want to know how I can draw this texture so that the alpha channel in the image is treated as all 1's and the texture is drawn like an RGB image.</p>

<p>Consider the base image: </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/XIGGw.png"" alt=""http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~jcoplan/alpha/base.png""></p>

<p>This image is a progression from 0 to 255 alpha and has the RGB value of 255,0,0 throughout</p>

<p>However if I draw it with blending disabled I get an image that looks like:
www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~jcoplan/alpha/no_alpha.png</p>

<p>When what I really want is an image that looks like this:
www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~jcoplan/alpha/correct.png</p>

<p>I'd really appreciate some pointers to have it ignore the alpha channel completely.  Note that I can't just load the image in as an RGB initially because I do need the alpha channel at other points.</p>

<p>Edit:  I tried to use GL_COMBINE to solve my problem as such:</p>

<pre><code>glColorf(1,1,1,1);
glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL_COMBINE);

glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_COMBINE_RGB, GL_REPLACE);
glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_SRC0_RGB, GL_TEXTURE);
glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_OPERAND0_RGB, GL_SRC_COLOR);

glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_COMBINE_ALPHA, GL_REPLACE);
glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_SRC0_ALPHA, GL_PRIMARY_COLOR);
glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_OPERAND0_ALPHA, GL_SRC_ALPHA); 
[self drawTexture];

<p>This happens because in your source image all transparent pixels are black. It's a problem with your texture/image, or maybe with loader function, but it is not an OpenGL problem.</p>

<p>You could probably try to fix it using glTexEnv(GL_COMBINE... ) (i.e. mix texture color with underlying color based on alpha channel), but since I haven't done something like that, i'm not completely sure, and can't give you exact operands. It was possible in Direct3D9 (using D3DTOP_MODULATEALPHA_ADDCOLOR), so most likely there is a way to do it in opengl.</p>

"3206790","<p>I'm developing a FlashCard App. Part of this is giving the user the option to filter results on difficulty level and category (more options in the future probably). See the image for a quick mockup of the user screen. </p>

<p>The data for the flash cards are stored in a Derby DB in a single table. One column for Level. A column for each category with a ""Y"" or ""N"" holding whether the card falls into that category.</p>

<p>Currently, I have a Filter class that just has a variable for each checkbox. I then pass this to the Database class. But from there it is a complex set of if/else statements to build the correct SELECT statement query.</p>

<p>1) Is there a better way to design this?<br>
2) Is my 1 table approach doomed or is it fine in this case? What pitfalls am I walking into?  </p>

Instead of making a boolean column per level, I would suggest an enum or integer column for level, and either a category table and a JOIN between the two using foreign keys to allow questions to be linked to one or more category, or a ""category"" column which also uses enums or integers. This way, when you add/remove/rename a new category or level, you are not modifying your database schema. It is independent from the data it contains. </p>

<hr>

<p>Also, this will greatly simplify your SQL queries. Compare:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM questions WHERE category1 = false AND category2 = false AND category3 = false ... and (level = 1 OR level = 2);

<p>Note there is another cause of this, but since the title here is editedformattedvalue, i'll note this example first.</p>

<p><strong>Example involving EditedFormattedValue as cause.</strong></p>

<p>(when you double click the cell, (thus going into edit mode), it goes black)</p>

<pre><code>namespace simpleblackdgv2
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        DataGridView dataGridView1 = new DataGridView();

        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {

            // BUG IS THAT WHEN YOU DOUBLE CLICK A CELL, IT GOES BLACK


            dataGridView1.Columns.Add(""Column1"", ""Column1"");

            dataGridView1.Rows.Add(1);

            dataGridView1.AllowUserToAddRows = false;


            this.Controls.Add(dataGridView1);


            dataGridView1.EditingControlShowing += DataGridView1_EditingControlShowing;

        }

        private void DataGridView1_EditingControlShowing(object sender, DataGridViewEditingControlShowingEventArgs e)
        {

            // doesn't work
             string str = dataGridView1.CurrentCell.EditedFormattedValue.ToString();



        }


        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>On a related note this is another example of it going black, though not from editedformattedvalue   (A previous edit to this question has a longer example, this is a simpler one that cuts to it quicker). The bug shows an issue when the general autosize settings are on  - set to allcells, and a specific one is set to None, then it can get buggy depending on how you order the statements, which must be a bug.  When setting any specific autosize, set the general to off.</p>

"3209764","<p>I am trying to create a stacked column chart in VBA where there is a bar graph and each bar graph shows the breakdown of subcategories on the graph (See right side of picture).

","How do I create a stacked column chart purely through programming with excel vba?","<excel><vba><charts><bar-chart>","2010-07-09 04:10:03","35477","3260406","4","<p>To create the stacked column effect, you need to create a series for each subdivision in the column.  For example, say we had 4 zoos.  Say they are located in Miami, Atlanta, New York, and Las Vegas.  Also, we have 4 animals, Lions, Tigers, Bears, and Seals.  And we want a stacked column showing the number of each animal and also the total number of animals.  </p>

<p>First, set the chart type to xl3DColumnStacked like this.</p>

<pre><code>ActiveChart.ChartType = xl3DColumnStacked
</code></pre>

<p>We would then create a series for each animal.</p>

<pre><code>ActiveChart.SeriesCollection.NewSeries
</code></pre>

<p>Then set the Values property to the array of values for the animal and the XValues property to the array of names for the cities.  So if the first series was for Lions, make an array with the # of lions at Miami, Atlanta, NY, Las Vegas and an array containing the strings ""Miami"",""Atlanta"", etc.  The cityNames array will be reused for each Series but the lionCounts will obviously be replaced each time with the appropriate array.  i.e. tigerCounts, bearCounts, etc.</p>

<pre><code>ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(1).Values = lionCounts
ActiveChart.SeriesCollection(1).XValues = cityNames
</code></pre>

<p>That should be all it takes to create a stacked column using values straight from your program instead of cell references.</p>

I've added a ribbon bar to the top of my main form using the <a href=""https://www.devcomponents.com/dotnetbar/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DotNetBar</a> and the problem is that it shows a black rectangle area instead of the default blue color. This only happens when I am using Windows 7 aero and is not maximized.</p>

<p>Also, make sure you're following the directions and using a DotNetBar form control:

"3218007","<p>OK so I have this applet which lets a player move his 32x32 character between tiles ... and anytime he is on the edge of the map then MOVES anywhere else... I get an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception. Also, when this happens, the character can walk through blocked tiles! However, this only happens on the east and south edges but on the south edge, the character CANNOT walk through blocked tiles upon moving away from the edge.</p>

<p>I don't know how to fix this and maybe you could help me?</p>

"3223058","<p>Suppose that we have the following partial ER diagram:</p>

<p><img src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/151329/schema.png"" alt=""An ER diagram with 5 entities: messages, submissions, attachments, assignments, and lectures""></p>

<p>Notice that the <code>attachments</code> table will subsequently be used for the messages', submissions', assignments', and lectures' attachments.</p>

<p>The problem is with the 3 one-to-one relationships between <code>attachments</code> and <code>messages</code>, <code>submissions</code>, and <code>assignments</code>. According to CakePHP's conventions, <code>Message belongsTo Attachment</code> (and <code>Attachment hasOne Message</code>) because <code>Message</code> contains the foreign key (the same thing applies to the other 2 relationships). Of course, it makes more sense to say that <code>Message hasOne Attachment</code> (and that <code>Attachment belongsTo Message</code>). If we only had <code>messages</code> and <code>attachments</code>, it would be easy to ""<em>properly orient</em>"" the relationship by moving the foreign key to <code>attachments</code>.</p>

<p>But the problem again is that <code>messages</code>, <code>submissions</code>, <code>assignments</code>, and <code>lectures</code> have relationships with the same <code>attachments</code> table. One way to get the ""<em>semantically correct</em>"" relationships is to have 4 different <code>Attachment</code> models: <code>MessageAttachment</code>, <code>SubmissionAttachment</code>, <code>AssignmentAttachment</code>, and <code>LectureAttachment</code>.</p>

<p>Assuming we are only interested in retrieving the attachment of a certain message, submission, or assignment, <strong>is it OK to use these <em>semantically reversed</em> associations, or should we <em>properly orient</em> them by separating <code>Attachment</code> into 4 different models as mentioned above?</strong></p>

"3224434","<p>Im posting from my phone so please excuse stupid typos and formatting issues. </p>

<p>I have an activity which lists saved games that the player can load.  </p>

<p>I created a simple layout xml file which defines a ScrollView. On load, I grab all the saved games and programatically add a view for each saved game to a vertically oriented LinearLayout child of the ScrollView. </p>

<p>The view for each game consists of a Horizontally oriented LinearLayout which in turn contains a Button and a vertically oriented LinearLayout.   That LinearLayout in turn contains some TextViews and ImageViews (and one more LinearLayout which I'm ommitting here for the sake of clarity).</p>

<p>The hierarchy looks something like this (some details omitted).  </p>

<pre><code> ScrollView
      LinearLayout - vertical 
           Each saved game:
           LinearLayout - horizontal 
                Button - load game
                LinearLayout - vertical 
                     TextView - game name
                     TextView - date string
</code></pre>

<p><strong>My problem:</strong></p>

<p>I would like the top of the button and the ""game name"" texview to be vertically aligned but the TextView (or maybe it's LinearLayout parent) has some rogue padding on top that I can't get rid of. See screenshot for details. </p>

For this type of situation you probably want a ListView with an item layout using RelativeLayout. (ListView will scale much better if there are many items, and if this is for a list of saved games it seems like this could grow quite a bit.) For this type of UI it's recommended to have the whole row/list item clickable rather than use a small Load button, but that's a design issue and ultimately up to you.</p>

<p>Don't use <code>getApplicationContext</code> for creating your views. Activity is a Context, just pass <code>this</code> in your case.</p>

<p>By default LinearLayouts try to align child views by their text baseline if present. Note that the bottom of your button's Load text aligns perfectly with the CURRENT_GAME text in your screenshot. Try <code>gameContainer.setBaselineAligned(false)</code>.</p>

<p>Normally your <code>gameInfo</code> layout would only report the baseline of one of its children if you set a baselineAlignedChildIndex, but it looks like this behavior changed between cupcake and eclair when creating LinearLayouts programmatically.

<p>I get the exact same error using Monodevelop 2.4, and I think this could be either from a broken GTK# installation or from a bug in Monodevelop, </p>

<p>Your result is the same as mine, see <a href=""http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2pt2ej6&amp;s=3"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. I suggest compiling MonoDevelop from <a href=""http://github.com/mono/monodevelop"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Github</a> and/or using a newer version of <strong>gtk-sharp/gdk-sharp</strong></p>

<p>This part </p>

<p>appears in GTK and GDK crashes,</p>

<p>If this does not resolve the problem submitting a <a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/Bugs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bug report</a> is the next option. Although this is somehow strange, since I managed to complete the same tutorial using Kubuntu 10.04 LTS 64 bit a few weeks ago.</p>
"
"3225092","<p>I have a list of events which are seperated by month and year (Jun 2010, Jul 2010 etc.). I have enabled fast scrolling because the list is really long. I've also implemented SectionIndexer so that people can see what month and year they are currently viewing when scrolling down the list of events at speed.</p>

<p>I don't have any problem with the implementation, just how the information is shown. Fast scrolling with SectionIndexer seems to only really be able to support a label with a single letter. If the list was alphabetised this would be perfect, however I want it to display a bit more text.</p>

<p>If you look at the screenshot bellow you'll see the problem I'm having.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/O6U55.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/O6U55.png"" alt=""A screenshot of the problem described""></a><br>

<p>What I want to know is: is it possible to change how the text in the centre of the screen is displayed. Can I change it somehow to make it look right (with the background covering all of the text).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance. If you need any clarification, or code just ask.</p>
","Fast Scroll display problem with ListAdapter and SectionIndexer","<android><listview>","2010-07-11 23:44:14","17869","5474667","2","<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Full sample code for this solution available <a href=""https://github.com/nolanlawson/CustomFastScrollViewDemo/"">here</a>.</p>

<p>I had this same problem - I needed to display full text in the overlay rectangle rather than just a single character.  I managed to solve it using the following code as an example: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/apps-for-android/source/browse/trunk/RingsExtended/src/com/example/android/rings_extended/FastScrollView.java"">http://code.google.com/p/apps-for-android/source/browse/trunk/RingsExtended/src/com/example/android/rings_extended/FastScrollView.java</a></p>

<p>The author said that this was copied from the Contacts app, which apparently uses its own implementation rather than just setting <code>fastScrollEnabled=""true""</code> on the <code>ListView</code>.  I altered it a little bit so that you can customize the overlay rectangle width, overlay rectangle height, overlay text size, and scroll thumb width.</p>

<p>For the record, the final result looks like this: <a href=""http://nolanwlawson.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/pokedroid_1.png"">http://nolanwlawson.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/pokedroid_1.png</a></p>

<p>All you need to do is add these values to your res/values/attrs.xml:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;declare-styleable name=""CustomFastScrollView""&gt;

    &lt;attr name=""overlayWidth"" format=""dimension""/&gt;
    &lt;attr name=""overlayHeight"" format=""dimension""/&gt;
    &lt;attr name=""overlayTextSize"" format=""dimension""/&gt;
    &lt;attr name=""overlayScrollThumbWidth"" format=""dimension""/&gt;

&lt;/declare-styleable&gt;

"3230171","<p>I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but here goes...</p>

<p><strong>Short version:</strong> I'm trying to compute the orientation of a triangle on a plane, formed by the intersection of 3 edges, without explicitly computing the intersection points.</p>

<p><strong>Long version:</strong> I need to triangulate a PSLG on a triangle in 3D. The vertices of the PSLG are defined by the intersections of line segments with the plane through the triangle, and are guaranteed to lie within the triangle. Assuming I had the intersection points, I could project to 2D and use a point-line-side (or triangle signed area) test to determine the orientation of a triangle between any 3 intersection points.</p>

<p>The problem is I can't explicitly compute the intersection points because of the floating-point error that accumulates when I find the line-plane intersection. To figure out if the line segments strike the triangle in the first place, I'm using some freely available robust geometric predicates, which give the sign of the volume of a tetrahedron, or equivalently which side of a plane a point lies on. I can determine if the line segment endpoints are on opposite sides of the plane through the triangle, then form tetrahedra between the line segment and each edge of the triangle to determine whether the intersection point lies within the triangle.</p>

<p>Since I can't explicitly compute the intersection points, I'm wondering if there is a way to express the same 2D orient calculation in 3D using only the original points. If there are 3 edges striking the triangle that gives me 9 points in total to play with. Assuming what I'm asking is even possible (using only the 3D orient tests), then I'm guessing that I'll need to form some subset of all the possible tetrahedra between those 9 points. I'm having difficultly even visualizing this, let alone distilling it into a formula or code. I can't even google this because I don't know what the industry standard terminology might be for this type of problem.</p>

<p>Any ideas how to proceed with this?  Thanks.  Perhaps I should ask MathOverflow as well...</p>

<p>EDIT: After reading some of the comments, one thing that occurs to me... Perhaps if I could fit non-overlapping tetrahedra between the 3 line segments, then the orientation of any one of those that crossed the plane would be the answer I'm looking for. Other than when the edges enclose a simple triangular prism, I'm not sure this sub-problem is solvable either. </p>

","Computational geometry, tetrahedron signed volume","<math><geometry>","2010-07-12 16:18:30","2639","3237210","4","<p>I am answering this on both MO &amp; SO, expanding the comments I made on MO.</p>

<p>My sense is that no computational trick with signed tetrahedra volumes will avoid the precision issues that are your main concern. This is because, if you have tightly twisted segments, the orientation of the triangle depends on the precise positioning of the cutting plane.
<br>[image removed; see below]<br>
In the above example, the upper plane crosses the segments in the order (<em>a,b,c</em>) [ccw from above]: (<em>red,blue,green</em>), while the lower plane crosses in the reverse order (<em>c,b,a</em>): (<em>green,blue,red</em>). The height
of the cutting plane could be determined by your last bit of precision.</p>

<p>Consequently, I think it makes sense to just go ahead and compute the points of intersection in
the cutting plane, using enough precision to make the computation exact.  If your segment endpoints coordinates and plane coefficients have <em>L</em> bits of precision, then there is just a small constant-factor increase needed.  Although I am not certain of precisely what that factor is, it is small--perhaps 4.  You will not need e.g., <em>L</em><sup>2</sup> bits, because the computation is solving linear equations.
So there will not be an explosion in the precision required to compute this exactly.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

"3232530","<h1>Back Arrow Broken In Xcode?</h1>
<p>Is there  keyboard command to go back/forward one <strong>file</strong> at a time.</p>
<p>Xcode 3.2 <em>changed the behavior</em> of Cmd-Opt &lt;-- and --&gt;. As noted in another question, they do not operate on a file level like in previous versions of Xcode, but on an &quot;edit point&quot;, making it cumbersome to flip through a list of files (the quick way to do it, since Xcode does not support Tabs, as in Eclipse).</p>
<p>Rob Keniger found a partial solution that he noted in another post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Hold down the option key while you click the forward/backward arrows ...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this requires fiddling with the mouse. Is there any way to do it with the <strong>keyboard only</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:
Later versions of Xcode (v7.2+) now have a Navigate menu (and it changes the keyboard shortcuts yet again): <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/FQzTd.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/FQzTd.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>

<p>You can test it by plotting both ellipsoids in the same axes, i.e. after you plotted the first ellipsoid, you run</p>

<p>Now you can rotate the plot (click on the button with the circlular arrow, then drag the plot) and you'll see that the two ellipsoids coincide very well. If the second one was bigger than the first one, you'd see a space between the two; if the second one was smaller than the first one, you would only see the first, opaque one.</p>

"3236161","<p>This has probably been asked over and over but I couldn't find anything useful so here it goes again...</p>
<p>In my application I need to render a fairly large mesh (a couple of million triangles or more) and I'm having some problems getting decent frame rates out of it. The CPU is pretty much idling so I'm definitely GPU-bound. Changing the resolution doesn't affect performance, so it's not fragment- or raster-bound.</p>
<p>The mesh is dynamic (but locally static) so I cannot store the whole thing in the video card and render it with one call. For application specific reasons the data is stored as an octree with voxels in the leafs, with means I get frustum culling basically for free. The vertex data consist of coordinates, normals and colors - no textures or shaders are used.</p>
<p>My first approach was to just render everything from memory using one big <code>STREAM_DRAW</code> VBO, which turned out to be too slow. My initial thought was that I was perhaps overtaxing the bus (pushing ~150 MiB per frame), so I implemented a caching scheme that stores geometry recently used to render the object in static VBOs on the graphics card, with each VBO storing a couple of 100 KiB to a couple of MiB worth of data (storing more per VBO gives more cache thrashing, so there's a trade-off here). The picture below is an example of what the data looks like, where everything colored red is drawn from cached VBOs.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/nXQfS.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/nXQfS.png"" alt=""Example of the rendered data"" /></a><br />
<sub>(source: <a href=""http://gimaker.users.sourceforge.net/0010.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sourceforge.net</a>)</sub></p>
<p>As the numbers below show, I don't see a spectacular increase in performance when using the cache. For a fully static mesh of about 1 million triangles I get the following frame rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Without caching: 1.95 Hz</li>
<li>Caching using vertex arrays: 2.0 Hz (&gt;75% of the mesh is cached)</li>
<li>Caching using <code>STATIC_DRAW</code> VBOs: 2.4 Hz</li>
</ul>
<p>So my questions is how do I speed this up? I.e.:</p>
<ul>
<li>What's the recommended vertex format to get decent performance? I use interleaved storage with positions and normals as <code>GL_FLOAT</code> and <code>GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE</code> for colors, with one padding byte to get 4-byte alignment (28 bytes/vertex total).</li>
<li>Whether using the same buffer for normals for all my boxes might help (all boxes are axis-aligned so I can allocate a normal buffer the size of the largest cache entry and use it for them all).</li>
<li>How do I know which part of the pipeline is the bottleneck? I don't have a spectacular video card (Intel GM965 with open source Linux drivers) so it's possible that I hit its limit. How much throughput can I expect from typical hardware (2-3 year old integrated graphics, modern integrated graphics, modern discrete graphics)?</li>
<li>Any other tips on how you would tackle this, pitfalls, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not interested in answers suggesting LOD (I already tested this), vendor-specific tips or using OpenGL features from anything later than 1.5.</p>

Get yourself an NVidia card (and get over having to use the binary driver, it just works) and you'll be all set. Doesn't even have to be current generation though a top end Quadro (if work is paying) or top end GTX 400 series (if you're paying or just trying to save some bucks at work) should do just fine w/ the latest drivers.

"3239120","<p>This is a fairly lengthy (not overly complex) design question so please bear with me. I'm trying to implement a person/role management system with POJOs and JPA. I'm fairly new to ORM and this is mostly a mapping problem.</p>

<p>I've got this working as POJOs and am comfortable with the caller-level API, but would now like to map it to a database using JPA or Hibernate in a Seam environment.</p>

<p>My implementation is based on the Decorator (GoF) and Person Role Object patterns (Baumer/Riehle et al). All roles are hard-coded and run-time addition of new roles is not supported since it would require code changes to extend behavior. I'd use user groups to implement security and permissions.</p>

<p>There is a Person interface with role management methods such as addRole(), removeRole(), hasRole(), getRole(), getRoles(), among other things. The concrete implementation is provided by a PersonImpl class.</p>

<p>There is an abstract class Role which also implements the Person interface (for decorator substitution equivalence), and a RoleImpl class that extends it. The Role class holds a reference to a person instance, using it to service any method / property calls on the person interface, meaning all subclasses of Role can handle the Person interface. The role constructor takes the person object as a parameter.</p>

<p>These are the interfaces/classes:</p>

<p>I'd use these classes like so:</p>

<pre><code>Person p = new Person(""Doe"", ""John"", Person.MALE, ...);
// assuming Employee extends Role
Employee e = (Employee)p.addRole(Employee.class);
</code></pre>

<p>Since the Role class also implements the Person interface, I can also do:</p>

<pre><code>// assuming Parent extends Role
Parent parent = new Parent((PersonImpl)p);

e.addRole(Parent.class);
e.getDateOfBirth();  // handled by the decorated person class

// assuming Manager extends Employee extends Role
Manager m = (Manager)p.getRole(Manager);

if (m.hasRole(Employee.class) { 
    // true since Manager derives from Employee
}
</code></pre>

<p>The questions I have are:</p>

<p>(a) Is this implementation needlessly complex and if so what would be a simpler approach? Note that this goes into a non-trivial business application and not a kiddy project, and I think the role subclassing is important to leverage behavior in cases such as Employee, Manager, etc.</p>

<p>(b) How do I map this in JPA/Hibernate?</p>

<p>(c) Can it be mapped so I can also take advantage of Seam Identity Management? (My definition of Role is clearly not analogous to Seam's)</p>

<p>(d) If I go with a table-per-subclass (InheritanceType.JOINED) mapping strategy, I map PersonImpl as PERSONS and RoleImpl as ROLES tables, and map each subclass of RoleImpl (such as Employee and Parent) to their own tables as EMPLOYEES and PARENTS.</p>

<p>I would then have a @ManyToMany relationship between PERSONS and ROLES (on the roles collection in PersonImpl), with the join-table PERSON_ROLES. </p>

<p>Now the problem is that the EMPLOYEES and PARENTS tables, etc. have only the ROLE_ID reference, since the inheritance mapping strategy obviously considers them to be extensions to Roles (ROLES) whereas I need them as addendum to PERSON_ROLES, and require the USER_ID + ROLE_ID key to be resolved properly, or at least the USER_ID.</p>

<p>I would prefer a normalized database with the attendant reliance on extra joins than a denormalized database which will be difficult to maintain and likely bunch up a ton of unused and irrelevant fields, which is why I think table-per-subclass is the way to go.</p>

<p>Or is a table-per-class-hierarchy (InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE)  with a discriminator column OK (from database maintenance perspective) in this scenario? Note that some roles are likely to have dozens of properties/fields.</p>

<p>(e) Is there a better alternative to this design?</p>

<p>Would very much appreciate any ideas/suggestions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So please bear with me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So my answer will be based on what you said</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All roles are hard-coded... There is an abstract class Role...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If There is an AbstractRole class, so i suppose some properties defined in AbstractRole class <strong>are inherited by all of subclasses</strong></p>

<pre><code>@Entity
/**
  * Which strategy should we use ??? keep reading
  */
@Inheritance
public abstract class AbstractRole implements Serializable {

    private Integer id;

    private String commonProperty;
    private String otherCommonProperty;
    private String anotherCommonProperty;

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    public Integer getId() {
        return this.id;
    }

    // getter's and setter's

}
</code></pre>

<p>Now Employee (Same approach used by Parent and Student)</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class Employee extends AbstractRole {

    private String specificEmployeeProperty;

    // getter's and setter's

}
</code></pre>

<p>But which inheritance strategy To use ???</p>

<p><strong>InheritanceType.JOINED</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Subclasses have a complex mapping: many properties, other relationships as @OneToMany, @OneToOne, @ManyToMany and so on</li>
<li>If you use Hibernate as JPA provider, keep in mind it does not support discriminator column. See <a href=""http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/ANN-140"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></li>
<li>A simple query will UNION ALL all of Table defined for each subclass. Maybe you just want to retrieve just one subclass and you will see performance issues. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2700680"">Here</a> goes an workaround.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Subclasses have a simple mapping. Not so many properties and minimal amount of other relationships</li>
<li>resolution of concrete class at runtime</li>
<li>It deals with a lot of nullable columns once all of subclasses share The same Table</li>
<li>Faster performance</li>
</ul>

<p>Now let's see </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a Person with role management methods such as addRole(), removeRole(), hasRole(), getRole(), getRoles(), among other things</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, if i see something like <em>addRole</em> method, i suppose Person has Either @OneToMany or @ManyToMany relationship with AbstractRole class. I know, i know... You have @ManyToMany relationship but <strong>i really advice</strong> you split your @ManyToMany into @OneToMany - @ManyToOne relationship. See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1212058/how-to-make-a-composite-primary-key-java-persistence-annotation/1252317#1252317"">here</a> how To</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class Person implements Serializable {

    private Integer id;

    private List&lt;AbstractRole&gt; roleList;

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    public Integer getId() {
        return this.id;
    }

    @OneToMany
    public List&lt;AbstractRole&gt; getRoleList() {
        return this.roleList; 
    }

    // getter's and setter's

}
</code></pre>

<p>And finally</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can it be mapped so I can also take advantage of Seam Identity Management</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Seam Identity Management <strong>allows you implement your own behavior regardless of using JPA or not</strong>.</p>

<pre><code>@Name(""authenticationManager"")
public class AuthenticationManager {

   /**
     * Starting with Seam 2.1+, you should use Credentials instead of Identity
     * To collect your username and password
     *
     * Your JSF Form should looks like
     *
     * &lt;h:inputText value=""#{credentials.username}""/&gt;
     * &lt;h:inputSecret value=""#{credentials.password}""/&gt;
     */
    private @In org.jboss.seam.security.Credentials credentials;

    /**
      * Login method
      *     must take no arguments
      *     must return a boolean indicating whether the credentials could be verified
      *
      * method name does not mind
      */
    public boolean authenticate() {
        /**
          * Logic To verify whether credentials is valid goes here
          */
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>And define your authenticate-method in <em>/WEB-INF/components.xml</em></p>

<pre><code>&lt;security:identity authenticate-method=""#{authenticationManager.authenticate}""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>About your mapping It depends on business requirement, customer needs and so on... but I Think it can be simpler as shown above</p>

<p>Good lucky!</p>

"3239336","<p>I remember solving a lot of indefinite integration problems. There are certain standard methods of solving them, but nevertheless there are problems which take a combination of approaches to arrive at a solution.
But how can we achieve the solution programatically.</p>

<p>For instance look at the online integrator app of Mathematica. So how do we approach to write such a program which accepts a function as an argument and returns the indefinite integral of the function.</p>

<p>If you're into complicated stuff, solving an ordinary differential equation is actually not harder (and computing an indefinite integral is equivalent to solving y' = f(x)). There exists a Galois differential theory which mimics Galois theory for polynomial equations (but with Lie groups of symmetries of solutions instead of finite groups of permutations of roots).

  direccion nvarchar(400),

"3240900","<p>At work, we use Perforce for version control.  There are problems with this: 1) with this centralized model, we can't check in changes until they are ready for regression.  This means that we have no revision control during the development process.  2) We don't back up our client view of the depot, so our work is unsafe until we can check it in. 3) We have problems sharing our code with each unless we beg to have an integration branch set up.  I am trying to set up an optional git workflow for developers who want to use git to beat these problems.</p>

<p>The plan is to use git-p4 to interface with the perforce server and create a private git repo.  This takes care of 1).  I plan to use the integration-manager workflow depicted in Git Pro (<a href=""http://progit.org/book/ch5-1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://progit.org/book/ch5-1.html</a>) to have our developers publish public repos, taking care of 3).  </p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/dkUgM.png"" alt=""Blessed Repo""></p>

<p>Finally, I want a place where developers can push their changes so that they will pulled into nightly backups / offsite backups.  The reason we don't backup our client views now is because doing nightly archival backups of everyone's client view is space inefficient.  We have a lot of developers, and they produce a lot of code.  We can't be redundantly backing up everyone's client view.  We only want to preserve the <em>unique changes that they are making</em> only.</p>

<p>My thinking was to have one bare git repo, call it <code>omni-backup</code>, that everyone can push all of their branches to (and feel free to suggest alternatives).  This would utilize git's space efficient sha-1 hashing and ensure that only unique versions of each file are backed up.  The trick is that all the backup repositories have to be part of the same repo to get the space efficiency.</p>

<p>The problem is when two people with completely different branches chose the same name for their branch.  E.G. Bob has a <code>feature</code> branch and Jane has a <code>feature</code> branch, but they're for different features.  If Bob pushes to omni-backup, Jane won't be able to, as it wouldn't be a fastforward merge.</p>

<p>Now what I would ideally want to have happen is that when Bob pushes his feature branch, the branch will be renamed to <code>bob-feature</code> on the <code>omni-backup</code> remote.  And when he pulls feature from <code>omni-backup</code>, he gets back <code>bob-feature</code>.  </p>

<p>This doesn't seem terribly easy to accomplish in git.  It looks like I can use push hooks documented in <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-receive-pack.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-receive-pack.html</a> post-receive hook to rewrite the name of the ref immediately after it written, and then <em>something</em> could be done to reverse the process on the way back, but it feels fragile.  Anyone have a better idea?</p>

<hr>

<p>edit: for VonC (Because code sucks in comments)
Your way sounds promising, VonC, but I don't see how the fact that it's a fetch will beat the namespacing problems.  Are you suggesting a cronjob that knows how to rename the branch?</p>

<p>like (really dirty):</p>

<pre><code>foreach my $user (@users) {
    my @branches = split(/s/,cat `$LDAPSERVER/$USER/$REPO/.git/refs/heads`);
    foreach my $branch (@branches) {
        system ""git fetch $LDAPSERVER/$USER/$REPO/$BRANCH:+$USER$BRANCH""
    }
}

"3241519","<p>I'm curious as to the 'proper' method for achieving the following functionality using Quarts2D:</p>

<p>I want to have a view, and to be able to add a circle at any coordinate. As soon as I add the circle it should expand at a predefined rate; I'd also like to repeat this process and have a number if these expanding circles.</p>

<p>Think Missile Command:</p>

<p><img src=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/86/A5200_Missile_Command.png"" alt=""Yellow spots keep expanding""></p>

<p>Generally, if I was writing this in C++ using SDL or some other graphics library I would:</p>

<p>Have a class to represent an 'growing circle'
Have a vector/array to hold pointers to all the 'growing circles' I create.</p>

<p>All circles diameters would be increased each tick, and in my renderloop I would iterate the list and draw appropriate circles to my buffer.</p>

<p>This, however, doesn't seem to fit well with how I've generally used views in previous iPhone development.</p>

<p>So I guess it's kind of open-ended, but is there a 'correct' way for something like this? </p>

<p>Would it be in a game loop style (as described above), or should I be subclassing <code>UIView</code> for a 'circle' object, and override <code>drawRect</code>? I guess I would then have to add each circle by creating a view and adding it to my main view?</p>

<p>Initial investigation also brought me across references to the <a href=""http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/documentation/GraphicsImaging/Reference/CAShapeLayer_class/Reference/Reference.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CAShapeLayer</a> class, though I'm guessing this might be much the same as implementing the UIView subclassing technique.</p>

<p>This code is basically a bunch of nested DIVS serving as an expandable/collapsable div structure. I removed all of the functionality for the purpose of printing this out. The problem, however, is that the page shows up in print preview perfectly... until it needs to page break onto the next page. The 2nd page has the rest of the text all jubbled up at the top of the page:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/DJaMf.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/DJaMf.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>Anyone have any clue as to what's going on? I'm assuming it's a FLOAT or INLINE/BLOCK problem, but I can't seem to figure out which.</p>

<p>The idea is that C is a fixed location that I want to maintain as my scaling origin rather than B which which is the current css behavior. C may or may not be within the actual image. So as the image scale, B needs to move relative to C. Example: if the image was scaled 50%, then B would move 1/2 the distance to C. If the image grew to 200% of its size, then B would move twice the distance away from C.</p>

<p>Ultimately looking for a formula for x &amp; y for B given the location of C and a scaling factor for the image. Not sure the size of the image needs to be part of this but I have it if needed.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Things I know:</p>

<ol>
<li>I know the width and height of the
image rectangle.</li>
<li>I know the offset of B from A.</li>
<li>I know the offset of C from A.</li>

<p>It may well just be a contrived example so that there was a conflict when shifting by one clock (the author had to do <em>something</em> to ensure that task 2 would catch up to task 1 and that seems the easiest solution) or unit0 may well be a non-linear processor of some sort.</p>

<p>Another example would have been trying to pump in a task at the point where the previous task was re-entering unit0.</p>

<p>What they're trying to show is that, given a maximum duration within a unit of <code>N</code> cycles in a pipeline, you have to limit your injections of work to one every <code>N</code> cycles to be sure of no conflict.</p>

<p>Visual Studio is just an IDE. You can use any source control solution that you want with it. Any open source source control solution in particular, like git, mercurial (hg) or subversion (svn). And there are commercial products like Perforce or SourceGear Vault. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_revision_control_software"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> for a pretty exhaustive list and google for more information.</p>

<p>You can find Visual Studio plugins that integrate it with any source control. Of open source ones subversion is especially rich in this regard. Commercial ones usually come with this integration.</p>

<p>And if you are not using source control that requires you to explicitly check-out files to edit them (like VSS or TFS do), the IDE integration is not even essential. I personally prefer to use git or subversion from outside the IDE.</p>

<p>The control hierarchy you create at runtime <em>is not recreated</em> at the correct point in the page life cycle during a postback request, if at all. </p>

<p>The ""classic"" approach that other web controls (e.g. DataGrid) take to tackle this problem is to serialise the data loaded into them into viewstate so that on postback, the control hierarchy can be reconstructed from postback values alone (without having to query the database again). However, implementing such an approach may not be appropriate in your circumstance.</p>

<p>Instead, you could build an array (or other serialisable enumeration) of <code>item</code> key values (<code>item.Nav_ID</code>) that were used to build the previous control hierarchy, and add this to viewstate, e.g.: </p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Int32&gt; navIdValues = new List&lt;Int32&gt;();
foreach (var item in query)
{
    navIdValues.Add(item.Nav_ID);
}
Page.ViewState(""NavIdValues"") = navIdValues
</code></pre>

<p>Then, during the <code>Page.Init</code> event of an incoming postback, retrieve the values you used to build the control hierarchy in the previous request:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Int32&gt; navIdValues = Page.ViewState(""NavIdValues"") as List&lt;Int32&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>Re-execute your query, building a dictionary of item's accessible by their <code>Nav_ID</code>:</p>

<pre><code>IDictionary&lt;Int32, ??itemtype??&gt; items = query.ToDictionary(n =&gt; n.Nav_Id);
</code></pre>

<p>And then re-build the control hierarchy as it existed in the previous request:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (Int32 navId in navIdValues)
{
     var item = items(navId); 

     Panel div = new Panel();
     div.ID = item.Nav_ID.ToString();
     div.CssClass = ""BulletDiv"";

     ... etc ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then your postback event's should fire as expected, because the control hierarchy has been recreated before postback event handling. This may not be the most optimal solution, but is a workable one. </p>

"
"3247065","<p>I am trying to do the design of a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bejeweled"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bejeweled</a> game. I have basically 3 classes. The <code>Game</code> class, which is what is going to be used by the player, a <code>Board</code> class, that represents the board, and a <code>SwitchController</code> class that is responsible for checking if the wanted switch on the board is valid, making the switch, counting the number of possible switches available (so I can know when the game is over, etc).</p>

<p>My current design is something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>Game:
isGameOver()
isSwitchValid(coord1, coord2)
makeSwitch(coord1, coord2)
getPieceAt(coord)
getBoardLength()

IBoard:
getPieceAt(coord)
setPieceAt(coord, piece)
getLength()
</code></pre>

<p>My idea would then to have a <code>ISwitchController</code>:</p>

<pre><code>ISwitchController:
isSwitchValid(coord1, coord2)
makeSwitch(coord1, coord2)
getAllValidSwitches()
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a little diagram of how the classes are to be organized:
<img src=""https://yuml.me/diagram/scruffy/class/%5BGame%5D-%3E%5BISwitchController%5D,%20%5BISwitchController%5D-%3E%5BIBoard%5D,%20%5BGame%5D-%3E%5BIBoard%5D"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I would have 2 different concrete classes of <code>IBoard</code> available for use (and for each one of them, I'd have to have an <code>ISwitchController</code> implementation).</p>

<h2>The problem:</h2>

<p>My program is to have 2 IBoard implementations:</p>

<p>The first, <code>ArrayBoard</code>, will have all the pieces of the board stored in a 2D Array. There is nothing special about it. I will define an <code>ArrayBoardSwitchController</code> for managing this class.</p>

<p>The second, <code>ListBoard</code>, will have for each color of pieces, a List/Set with all the coordinates of the pieces of that color. I will define a <code>ListBoardSwitchController</code> for managing this class.</p>

<p>The main issue here is that the implementation of <code>SwitchController</code> will be totally different on <code>ArrayBoard</code> and on <code>ListBoard</code>. For example, while for implementing <code>getAllValidSwitches()</code> <code>ArrayBoardSwitchController</code> only needs the <code>getPieceAt()</code> method, that would not be a good idea to do with <code>ListBoardSwitchController</code>(in that class I use internally lists because it's easier to check if the move is valid that way). </p>

<p>From what I can see, there are 2 different possible solutions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I could either merge together the
<code>ISwitchController</code> and <code>IBoard</code>
interfaces. That way I'd only have
two classes, Game and Board (while
basically Game would just be a
controller for the Board, as it
would be the Board that had all the
game logic). It wouldn't be that nice
because the classes wouldn't be
as cohese as they could be if I had
3 distinct classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Let the interfaces as they are and put
all the methods I need to work with public
in the concrete classes. For example, if I need
a <code>getYellowPiecesList()</code> method, I'd put it public
on <code>ListBoard</code> so <code>ListBoardSwitchController</code> could
use it. <code>ListBoardSwitchController</code> would only
know about it because it knows it only works
against <code>ListBoards</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What's your opinion on the matter? <em>The focus here is not so much on how to design the Bejeweled game, but how to solve this problem, that is recurrent when you try to implement algorithms: on one hand you want to have a clear and good OOP design, and in the other sometimes that gets in the way of having a sound and effective algorithm implementation.</em></p>
","Problems designing Bejeweled game","<c#><java><oop>","2010-07-14 14:23:11","1734","3247242","3","<blockquote>
  <p>The main issue here is that the implementation of SwitchController will be totally different on ArrayBoard and on ListBoard. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If this is the case, then it sounds like you haven't designed the <code>IBoard</code> interface well enough so that classes can use an implementation of <code>IBoard</code> without knowing the implementation details. If the user of an <code>IBoard</code> needs to know what implementation is being used, then it almost defeats the purpose of having an interface!</p>

<p>I would strongly suggest re-visiting the methods you are exposing on <code>IBoard</code> to see if there is a way you can expose something like ""get the piece at this coordinate"" in a more generic way. Make sure that any methods a controller needs to invoke on a <code>IBoard</code> instance are <strong>only</strong> the methods in the <code>IBoard</code> interface.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For example, while for implementing getAllValidSwitches() ArrayBoardSwitchController only needs the getPieceAt() method, that would not be a good idea to do with ListBoardSwitchController(in that class I use internally lists because it's easier to check if the move is valid that way).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If an operation such as ""get piece at this coordinate"" is instrumental to the <code>IBoard</code> interface, then the implementations must be faithful to their contract and implement it correctly. It sounds as if your <code>ListBoard</code> is not faithfully meeting the contract set out in <code>IBoard</code>.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>x.ToString()</code> you can call whatever method or property you like that returns string.
If <code>engMyTallyList</code> is not generic, you will need to cast it before using <code>Select</code>.</p>

<pre><code>engMyTallyList.Cast&lt;MyTally&gt;().Select(x =&gt; x.ToString()).ToArray()

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
You don't have to convert from <code>List&lt;ENG_MPD&gt;</code> to <code>ArrayList</code> to add it into <code>SQL</code>. Use</p>

<pre><code>engMpdIntersectList.Select(x =&gt; x.ToString()).ToArray()

<p>or if you have initially an <code>ArrayList</code> of <code>ENG_MPD</code>, use</p>

<pre><code>engMyTallyList.Cast&lt;ENG_MPD&gt;().Select(x =&gt; x.ToString()).ToArray()

"3248106","<p>I'm coding a tab system for my website that must be entirely CSS/HTML/JS (without using any images).  Problem is, I keep hacking the code until when I'm finished its just a mess.  I don't know whether to use positioning, or float the tabs or what.  Basically one of the big problems is that after I take away the bottom-border CSS of the selected tab, I need to move it down 1px so it seamlessly blends with the sorting headers - I don't know whether to use margin: -1px or position: relative/absolute etc.  I'd love some advice on a good way to code a tab system like this, so that it can be reused across the website!</p>

<p>What I did was to go into my project.pbxproj and remove the offending entry from the section that starts with ""/* Begin PBXBuildFile section */"" near the top of the file.</p>

<p>I then restarted Xcode, no dialog box, so I exited it gracefully. I then restored the project.pbxproj from source control, started xcode and the problem seemed to vanish.</p>

<hr>

<p>After thinking on the problem I think I have a better way to ask the question(s). In the implementation of PersonToPerson above I have the relation as a simple string. I want the user to be able to select from a list of unique relations, which are defined in the constraints, for the string value for PersonToPerson. So this leads to the questions...</p>

<ol>
<li>Should personToPerson and personToStore be consolidated into one list of type Relationship? Or should they stay independent lists as shown?</li>
<li>What is the mechanism to allow the user to add new values to the relation constraint?</li>

<p>Keep your code simple. Don't create generic data model. It's way to hell. When you personToPerson and personToStore keep separate, it's much easier to follow your code. </p>

<p>Actually suggested solution makes it possible to access relations as consolidated and independent list simultaneously.</p>

<p>For this problem I would use <a href=""http://grails.org/doc/latest/guide/5.%20Object%20Relational%20Mapping%20(GORM).html#5.2.3%20Inheritance%20in%20GORM"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">inheritance feature in GORM</a>.</p>

<p>Your classes would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Person {
    String name
    static hasMany = [personToPerson:PersonToPerson,
                      personToProduct:PersonToProduct,
                      personToStore:PersonToStore]

    static mappedBy = [personToPerson:""from""]
}

class Product{
    String productName
}

class Relationship{
    String note
}

class Store{
    String storeName
}

class PersonToPerson extends Relationship{
    Person from
    Person to
    String relation

    static constraints = {
         relation(inList:[""Friend to"", ""Enemy of"", ""Likes"", ""Hates""])
    }
    static belongsTo = [ from:Person ]
}

class PersonToProduct extends Relationship{
    Person person
    Product product
    String relation

    static constraints = {
         relation(inList:[""likes"", ""dislikes""])
    }
    static belongsTo = [ person:Person ]
}

class PersonToStore extends Relationship{
    Person person
    Store store
    String relation

    static constraints = {
        relation(inList:[""Stock person"", ""Owner"", ""Manager"", ""Patron""])
    }
    static belongsTo = [ person:Person ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>DB schema for Person, Product and Store is usual. But for Relational domains look like this:</p>

<p><strong>Relationship</strong></p>

<pre><code>Field      Type         Null Default 
id         bigint(20)   No   
version    bigint(20)   No   
note       varchar(255) No   
class      varchar(255) No   
person_id  bigint(20)   Yes  NULL  
product_id bigint(20)   Yes  NULL  
relation   varchar(8)   Yes  NULL  
from_id    bigint(20)   Yes  NULL  
to_id      bigint(20)   Yes  NULL  
store_id   bigint(20)   Yes  NULL   
</code></pre>

<p>Relationship domain makes possible to access all relational domain throw one domain.</p>

<h1>2) Constraint</h1>

<p>Just switch <em>inList</em> to <em>validator</em>. Than you can store constrain in file or DB.

<p>As you can see the invinventory slots are OVERLAPPING the game panel which should NOT happen because the game panel is in the CENTER  of the BorderLayout and the Inventory panel (invOne) is on the EAST of the BorderLayout so I don't know why it's overlapping...</p>

"3253469","<p>i want to create a software for planning routes of busses (and their optimal loading) for disabled-kids-transportation.</p>

<p>these busses have following specifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>m seats (maximum 7 - as there is a driver and an assistance)</li>
<li>o ""seats"" for wheel-chairs (maximum 4)</li>
<li>fixed amount of maximum load (in austria: 9 or 20 persons; 9 for eg. ford transit; 20 for eg. mercedes benz sprinter)</li>
</ul>

<p>specifications for routes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the journey to the institutes must be shorter than 2 hours for a kid (not for the bus)</li>
<li>for optimization: it may be optimal to mix institutes</li>
</ul>

<p>example
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/o291L.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/o291L.png"" alt=""alt text""></a>
</p>

<p>the optimal route 1 would be:</p>

<ul>
<li>6, 1, 7, group (2, 3, 4, 5), insitute A (exit for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 8, 9, insitute B (exit for 7, 8, 9) or</li>
<li>1, 7, 6, group (2, 3, 4, 5), insitute A (exit for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 8, 9, insitute B (exit for 7, 8, 9) or</li>
<li>7, 1, 6, group (2, 3, 4, 5), insitute A (exit for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), 8, 9, insitute B (exit for 7, 8, 9) or</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p>depending on the specific road (aka the road distance for the triangle 1-6-3 and 7-1-6)</p>

<p>this is simple example. when it comes down to transport wheel-chairs it's more complex.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong><br>
<em>NOTE:</em> there are more than 2 instutes, as there are more than 9 kids. this was just for giving an example. in real world there would be 600 kids and 20 institutes...</p>

<p>what data do i need?<br>
my guesses were: coordinates, distances between points (not air-line distance, rather the road distance), type of ""seat-usage"" (seat or wheel-chair), somehow road specifications (may be obsolete due to distance)</p>

<p>can anyone please come up with some idea, algorithm, logic, feedback, (free! as disabled-kid-transportation is no enterprise business) software i may use to gain data (eg. coordinates, distances, ...).</p>

<p>oh, and i must say. i'm no studied software-engineer, so it's somehow hard to go through scentific literature, but i'm willed to get my hands dirty!</p>
","algorithm/logic to balance the load and determine the route of busses","<algorithm>","2010-07-15 07:44:40","278","3253898","1","<p>Well, this is actually what I do for a living. Basically, we solve this using MiP with column-generation and using a path-model. Seeing that the problem is quite small, I would think you can using the simpler edge-flow-model with a reasonable result. That will save you doing the column-generation, which is quite some work. I'd suggest starting out by calculating the flow on a given set off routes before thinking about generating the routes themselves --- in fact, I would simply do that ""by hand"" using the routing calculator and dual costs as a guide.</p>

<p>Specifically, you need to create a graph where each pickout and delivering point is a node, and each bus route is a set of connected notes. Connect as appropriate, this is really easier to draw than write :) Then, make a LP system that models the flow, constraining the flow to the bus' compacity, and either requiring that all passengers are delivered or pay a heavy toll for not doing so.</p>

<p>Once that is in place, create boolean variables for each route and multiply this with the capacity: this will enable you to turn bus routes on and off. </p>

<p>Ask for details as needed, the above is just a rough outline.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Ok, reading the responses, I think I have to say that to solve this problem in the way I suggest, you at least need to have some knowledge about linear programming and graph theory. And yes, this is a problem that is <em>very</em> hard... so hard that I consider it unsolvable except for very small systems using the current computer technology. Seeing that this actually <em>is</em>  a very small. I think it would be possible, and you are very welcome to contact our company for help (contact@ange.dk).  However, professional assistance in optimization is not exactly cheap.</p>

<p>However, all is not lost! There are simpler ways, though the result will not be so good. When you cannot model, simulate! Write a simulation that given the bus routes, passengers etc shows how the passengers move along the bus routes. Make a score, where each bus you use cost something, each kilometer cost something, and each passenger not transported costs a lot. Then look at the result, change the routes and work toward the best (cheapest) solution you can come up with. It is probably not a bad solution.</p>

<p>Again, creating a program that will generate a solution for the above problem from scratch is not a suitable enterprise for someone not versed in LP+MiP+graph theory. But perhaps less can do it?</p>

<p>I will be on vacation for the next week or so.</p>

As of SDK level 4 (i.e. Android 1.6) you can pass a <code>View</code> to <a href=""http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TabHost.TabSpec.html#setIndicator(android.view.View)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>TabHost.TabSpec.setIndicator()</code></a>, which will allow you to completely control the look of the tabs.</p>

<p>However, tapping either of those buttons in the Market opens up a new Activity, and as such, using simple <code>Button</code>s might more closely reflect that behaviour than a TabHost would.</p>

<p>In the event that you need to support 1.5 as well, you could check out the zip archive from <a href=""http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/msg/55609a6413dad381"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this post</a>.

<p>In this case I have an animating red rectangle drawn onto a background.

"
"3257204","<p>Say I want to animate a ball rolling 1000 pixels to the right, specifying a timing function in the process – something like this:</p>
<pre><code>UIView *ball = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0,0,30,30)];
CABasicAnimation* anim =
        [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@&quot;transform.translation.x&quot;];
anim.toValue = [NSNumber numberWithFloat:ball.frame.origin.x + 1000.0];
                                            // move 1000 pixels to the right
anim.duration = 10.0;
anim.timingFunction = [CAMediaTimingFunction functionWithControlPoints:
                      0.1 :0.0 :0.3 :1.0]; // accelerate fast, decelerate slowly
[ball.layer addAnimation:anim forKey:@&quot;myMoveRightAnim&quot;];
</code></pre>
<p><strong>What I ultimately want</strong> is to have a method, say <code>-(void)animationProgressCallback:(float)progress</code>, be called during the animation, in regular intervals of the animation's progress <em>in terms of the absolute &quot;distance&quot; between start and end values</em>, i.e. ignoring the timing function.</p>
<p>I'll try to explain with the above example with the ball rolling 1000px to the right (charted by the y axis, in our case 100%=1000px):</p>
<p><img src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7493953/AnimationProgressCallback.png"" alt=""alt text"" /></p>
<p>I want my callback method to be invoked whenever the ball has progressed 250 pixels. Because of the timing function, the first 250 pixels might be reached in ti<sub>0</sub>=2 seconds, half the total distance reached just ti<sub>1</sub>= 0.7 seconds later (fast acceleration kicks in), the 750px mark another ti<sub>2</sub>= 1.1 seconds later, and needing the remaining ti<sub>3</sub>= 5.2 seconds to reach the 100% (1000px) mark.</p>
<p><strong>What would be great, but isn't provided:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ideas how to solve the problem:</strong></p>

<p>Actually this is reliable. CoreAnimation is time based, so you could use the delegate to be notified when the animation really starts.
And about calculating the bezier path... well look it this way: It could be worse if you would want to implement a surface in OpenGLES you would have to calculate a Cubic Bezier!. lol. Your case is only one dimension, is not that hard if you know the maths.</p>

"3258136","<p>In my latest ASP.NET MVC 2 application I have been trying to put into practice the concepts of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Domain Driven Design (DDD)</a>, the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</a>, <a href=""http://devlicio.us/blogs/billy_mccafferty/archive/2009/11/09/dependency-injection-101.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Inversion of Control (IoC)</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_driven_development"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Test Driven Development (TDD)</a>. As an architecture example I have been following Jeffery Palermo's ""<a href=""http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/the-onion-architecture-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Onion Architecture</a>"" which is expanded on greatly in <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/193518279X"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ASP.NET MVC 2 in Action</a>.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/7pmUF.png"" alt=""Onion Architecture Diagram""></p>

<p>While, I have begun to successfully apply most (some?) of these principles I am missing a key piece of the puzzle. I am having trouble determining the best mechanism for auto-wiring a service layer to my domain entities.</p>

<p>As an example: each domain entity that needs the ability to send an email should depend on an <code>IEmailService</code> interface. From my reading, best practice to reveal this dependency would be to use constructor injection. In my UI layer I perform a similar injection for repository interface implementations using the <code>StructureMapControllerFactory</code> from <a href=""http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ASP.NET MVC Contrib</a>.</p>

<p>Where I am confused is what is the best mechanism for auto-wiring the injection of the necessary services into domain entities? Should the domain entities even be injected this way? How would I go about using <code>IEmailService</code> if I don't inject it into the domain entities?</p>

<p>Additional Stack Overflow questions which are great DDD, SRP, IoC, TDD references:</p>

<p>I would have to argue this is upon itself is an <em>extreme</em> bastardization of DDD. Why should a domain entity ever need to depend on an email service? IMO it shouldn't. There is no justification for it.</p>

<p>However there are business operations in conjunction with a domain entity that would require the need to send emails. You should have your <code>IEmailService</code> dependency contained in this class here, not the domain entity. This class would most likely fall into one of a few nearly synonymous names: Model, Service or Controller dependent upon which architecture/layer you're in.</p>

<p>At this point your <code>StructureMapControllerFactory</code> would then correctly auto wire everything that would use the <code>IEmailService</code>.</p>

<p>While I might be minorly over generalizing it's pretty much standard practice to have domain entities be POCOs or be nearly POCOs (to avoid violation of the SRP) however frequently SRP is violated in domain entities for sake of serialization and validation. Choosing to violate SRP for those types of cross cutting concerns is more of a personal belief stance as opposed to a ""right"" or ""wrong"" decision.</p>

<p>As a final follow up if your question is on the portion of code that is truly operating in a stand alone service whether web or OS based and how to wire up the dependencies from that, a normal solution would be take over the service at a base level and apply IOC to it in the same similar fashion as the <code>StructureMapControllerFactory</code> does in MVC. How to achieve this would be entirely dependent upon the infrastructure you're working with.</p>

<p><strong>Response:</strong></p>

<p>Lets say you have <code>IOrderConfirmService</code> which has a method <code>EmailOrderConfirmation(Order order)</code>. You would end up with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyOrderConfirmService : IOrderConfirmService
{    
    private readonly IEmailService _mailer;

    public MyOrderConfirmService(IEmailService mailer)
    {        
        _mailer = mailer;        
    }

    public void EmailOrderConfirmation(Order order)
    {        
        var msg = ConvertOrderToMessage(order); //good extension method candidite
        _mailer.Send(msg);        
    }    
}
</code></pre>

<p>You would then have your <code>OrderController</code> class that would be something like</p>

<pre><code>public class OrderController : Controller
{    
    private readonly IOrderConfirmService _service;

    public OrderController(IOrderConfirmService service)
    {        
        _service= service;        
    }

    public ActionResult Confirm()
    {      
            _service.EmailOrderConfirmation(some order);

            return View();
    }    
}
</code></pre>

<p>StrucutreMap will inherently build up you're entire architecture chain when you use constructor injection correctly. This is the fundamental difference between tight coupling and inversion of control. So when the StructureMapFactory goes to build up your controller the first thing it will see is that it needs IOrderConfirmService. At this point it will check if it can plug IOrderConfirmService directly which it can't because it needs IEmailService. So it will check if it can plug IEmailService and for argumentsake lets say it can. So at this point it will build EmailService, which it will then build MyOrderConfirmService and plug in EmailService, and then finally build OrderController and plug in MyOrderConfirmService. This is where the term inversion of control comes from. StructureMap will build the EmailService first in the entire chain of dependencies and ending last with the Controller. In a tightly coupled setup this will be the opposite where the Controller will be built first and have to build the business service and then build the email service. Tightly coupled design is very brittle when compared to IOC.</p>

<p>When I select something from the treeview it passes a parameter to a linq command that selects some data from the database. For every item in the selection I want to make a Icon and a text that represents if the item is a folder or a file.
When I push the Icon or the Link i want it to do the same as i would push the treeview, pass a parameter to a linq command that selects again from the database and populates the placeholder.</p>

The problem with this that it does it every time i select something new and also i cant get it to work if the push the icon or the linkbutton, only the from the treeview.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%@ Control Language=""C#"" AutoEventWireup=""true"" CodeFile=""FolderButton.ascx.cs"" Inherits=""FolderButton"" %&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

<p>Add Properties and Click Event to the Code Behind (don't forget to fire the click event when your image and link buttons are clicked):</p>

<pre><code>public partial class FolderButton : System.Web.UI.UserControl
{
    public int DatabaseId { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set;}  // you can even set your linkbutton text here. 

    public event EventHandler Click;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Create your Repeater of the FolderButton Controls:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;asp:Repeater ID=""rptFolders"" runat=""server"" OnItemDataBound=""rptFolders_ItemDataBound""&gt;
            &lt;ItemTemplate&gt;

        &lt;/asp:Repeater&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Set Folder Id on DataBinding:</p>

<pre><code>protected void rptFolders_ItemDataBound(object sender, RepeaterItemEventArgs e)        
{        
    if (e.Item.ItemType == ListItemType.Item || e.Item.ItemType == ListItemType.AlternatingItem)        
    {        
        Book book = (Book)e.Item.DataItem; //Or whatever your passing        

        FolderButton btnFolder = e.Item.FindControls(""FolderButton1"");

        btnFolder.Name=book.Name;
        btnFolder.DatabaseId=book.Id;

        btnFolder.Click += new EventHandler(FolderClicked);        
    }        
}     
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly you can then do whever you want on the event Click:</p>

<pre><code>     void FolderClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
     int id = ((FolderButton)sender).DatabaseId;

     /// Do something with your Id
