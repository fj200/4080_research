<p><strong>Command-line Python in Windows:</strong> </p>

<li><p>Save your python code file somewhere, using ""Save"" or ""Save as"" in your editor.  Lets call it 'first.py' in some folder, like ""pyscripts"" that you make on your Desktop.</p></li>

<li><p>Navigate to where your python file is, using the commands 'cd' (change directory) and 'dir' (to show files in the directory, to verify your head).  For our example something like, </p>

Another neat and similar feature in Eclipse was the vertical ""error bar"" to the right of your code (not sure what to call it).

I've done a bit of googleing and have found a couple of solutions, but neither seem super elegant, and I worry if they will be unusable once I come to use a shared hosting environment for the application.
Solution 1


Right-click your application virtual directory on inetmgr.exe.
Properties->Virtual Directory Tab-> Configuration.
Add a new mapping extension. The extension should be .*, which will be
  mapped to the Executable
  C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\aspnet_isapi.dll,
  or the appropriate location on your
  computer (you can simply copy this
  from the mapping for .aspx files). On
  the mapping uncheck ""check that file
  exists"".
3 X OK and you're good to go.
If you want, you can apply this setting to all your web sites. In
  step1, click on the ""Default Web Site""
  node instead of your own virtual
  directory, and in step 2 go to the
  ""Home Directory"" tab. The rest is the
  same.


It seems a tad hacky to route everything through ASP.NET.
Solutions 2
Edit the MVC routing to contain .mvc in the URL and then follow the steps in solution 1 based around this extension. Edit: The original image link was lost, but here it is from Google's Cache:

<blockquote>
  <p>If *.mvc extension is not registered

  <p>In this way all your controller

I know I can print the object in (gdb) using ""po planetArray"" or simply click in the debugger and ""print description to console"" I am just curious, as I am sure it worked prior to upgrading. Anyone know anything about this? 
cheers gary
edit: data formatters is on and it shows what you see above ...
",Xcode 3.2 Debug: Seeing whats in an array?,"['xcode', 'debugging']",9/15/2009 15:26,14755,1571095,3,"<p>This is because GDB acts as if the variable you are viewing is out of scope while it really just is confused about what each part function or method call of the data formatter is returning (the data formatter is the ""{(unichar *)Xcode_CFStringSummary($VAR, $ID)}:s"" part you are seeing. 
When you are debugging and you are in a method where you know a local variable must be in scope right now, open the debugger window and the area where you can see ""Variable"", ""Value"" and ""Summary"" column titles double click the ""Summary"" row entry for the variable you are interested in and enter the following (for array types like NSArray or NSCFArray):</p>

<p>""{(int)[$VAR count]} objects {(NSString *)[(NSArray *)$VAR description]}:s""</p>

<p>then press return. You have now overwritten the default data formatter provided by Xcode's GDB extension (to be found in various plists at ""/Developer/Library/Xcode/CustomDataViews/"") with your own data formatter string. </p>

<p>Your own overrides are saved at ""~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/CustomDataViews/CustomDataViews.plist"" and if you want to have the Apple default data formatter back just double click the row for a variable of the same type and delete whatever is there. </p>

<p>The nitty-gritty details: In the custom expression above the ""{}"" construct tells GDB to execute a command (as if you where executing it from GDB's debugger command line, which means the same restrictions apply: you need to specify the return type in cast parens in front of every function or method which returns something). The "":s"" behind the closing curly brace tells Xcode and GDB to reference the ""Summary"" column. Also valid would be "":v"" which references the ""Value"" column which most of the time is just the pointer value. Everything that is outside of the curly braces is shown verbatim. 
Unfortuntely curly braces can't be nested which invalidates ternary operator conditionals.</p>

<p>So with the above data formatter you should see the following for an empty NSArray:</p>

<p>""0 objects (\n)""</p>

<p>If you want to write your own data formatters as GDB extensions (equivalent to specifying a function akin to Xcode_CFStringSummary above) you can do so. Take a look at the following header: ""/Developer/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/PlugIns/GDBMIDebugging.xcplugin/Contents/Headers/DataFormatterPlugin.h""</p>

<p>it will tell you all you need to know. But it can be hard to get it right. It might be easier and less error prone to just define another method on your class and call that from the data formatter string instead of ""description"".</p>

I read this post here on SO, but it didn't answer my question, as I know the correct syntax, and I don't want to do anything with the exception that gets returned (I don't want to look at the Exception's members, though this could be useful down the road).
I wrote unit tests to prove my lack of understanding in the use of Dictionary, and couldn't get it handle the KeyNotFoundException that gets thrown.

<p>I'm sure that flax does most of this as-well, but when you're already used to this then switching slows you down.</p>

<p>I had the same issues when I started working with FD. What it boils down to is that flex has a bunch of libraries that it's using that FD doesn't unless you link to them, and sometimes even then.</p>

<p>But once you start compiling your libraries and assets into SWCs you will be able to compile them through Flash and Flex. Which can be handy (like when you're working with other developers)</p>

<p>FD doesn't have a profiler, but this has not prompted me to stop using it. When I need some debugging and trace isn't enough I add the demonsters debugger class: <a href=""http://www.monsterdebugger.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.monsterdebugger.com/</a> it's pretty powerful, but you still can't step through your code.
** Update - Flash Develop has had a profiler for a few versions now, It's good for watching memory use, but I still end up using monster debugger a lot. You can use debug in Flash Develop as-well and step through your code.**</p>

<p>FD doesn't have the UI that flex does, and for developing mxml it is a bit more tedious, but at pure as3, I find FD is all I need. Well than and Flash to create my SWCs</p>

794128,"I am trying to create a general method for disposing an object that implements IDisposable, called DisposeObject()
To make sure I am disposing an object pointed by original reference, I am trying to pass an object by reference.
But I am getting a compilation error that says

The 'ref' argument type doesn't match parameter type

In the below (simplified) code, both _Baz and _Bar implement IDisposable.

So the questions are,

Why am I getting this error?
Is there a way to get around it?

[UPDATE]
From provided answers so far, as long as I do not set an IDisposable argument to null, I can simply pass an object by value without using ref.
I am now having another trouble whether to set disposable objects to null or not within DisposeObject method.  
Here is the full source for completeness:
public class Foo : IDisposable
{
    private Bar _Bar;
    private Baz _Baz;
    private bool _IsDisposed;

    ~Foo() { Dispose(false); }

    public void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!_IsDisposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                DisposeObject(ref _Baz);
                DisposeObject(ref _Bar);
            }
        }

        _IsDisposed = true;
    }

    private void DisposeObject(ref IDisposable obj)
    {
        try
        {
            if (obj == null) 
                return;
            obj.Dispose();
            obj = null;
        } catch (ObjectDisposedException) { /* Already Disposed... */ }
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
}

public class Bar : IDisposable
{
    public void Dispose() {}
}

public class Baz : IDisposable
{
    public void Dispose() {}
}

[RESULT] 
I removed the code that sets argument to null (obj = null;) within DisposeObject
So the final code became.
    public void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!_IsDisposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                DisposeObject(_Baz);
                DisposeObject(_Bar);
            }
        }

        _IsDisposed = true;
    }

    private void DisposeObject(IDisposable obj)
    {
        try
        {
            if (obj == null) 
                return;
            obj.Dispose();
        } catch (ObjectDisposedException) { /* Already Disposed... */ }
    }

",Passing an IDisposable object by reference causes an error?,"['c#', 'dispose', 'idisposable', 'pass-by-reference']",4/27/2009 15:47,4448,794154,5,"<p>There is no need for you to pass by reference, as you're passing a reference type. You should remove the <code>ref</code> keyword from your method definition. Do this and you shouldn't have any issues, though I'm not sure how this is more effective or clearer than simply calling <code>Dispose()</code> (other than the fact that you don't have to cast it for explicit implementations and this does a <code>null</code> check for you).</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>Dance, while I hope the discussion that's surrounded this topic has been helpful to you, your original intent doesn't seem to be something that's doable. In order to pass something as <code>ref</code>, you can't pass a variable that has a type other than what the <code>ref</code> parameter expects (in other words, you can't pass a variable declared as a <code>class</code> or other <code>interface</code> that implements <code>IDisposable</code> if the <code>ref</code> parameter is <code>IDisposable</code>). Because <code>ref</code> parameters allow assignments to propagate back to the caller, you would open up the possibility of allowing incompatible types being stored in your variable.</p>

<p>Your best bet here is to assign <code>null</code> yourself if that's what you want. If you want to encapsulate the <code>null</code> check and ignoring exceptions in to the function that's fine, but <code>ref</code> will not work for you in this scenario no matter how you slice it, unfortunately.</p>

2418272,"i have bit of code that causes an underflow:
var
    t1, t2, delta: DWORD:
begin
   t1 := 0xffffff00;
   t2 := 0x00000037;

   delta := (t2 - t1);

The subtraction itself does generate an overflow (underflow), but i don't want Delphi to throw an EIntOverflow exception. So i try disabling the generation of overflow checking code by disabling overflow checking:
var
    t1, t2, delta: DWORD:
begin
   t1 := 0xffffff00;
   t2 := 0x00000037;

{$OVERFLOWCHECKS OFF}
   delta := (t2 - t1);
{$OVERFLOWCHECKS ON}

Yet even with the OVERFLOWCHECKS OFF option, it still throws an exception. And the generated code still contains the check:


A reminder of the documentation on $Q:

Overflow checking
Type Switch
Syntax {$Q+} or {$Q-}
      {$OVERFLOWCHECKS ON} or {$OVERFLOWCHECKS OFF}
Default {$Q-}
            {$OVERFLOWCHECKS OFF}
Scope Local  
Remarks 
The $Q directive controls the
  generation of overflow checking code.
  In the {$Q+} state, certain integer
  arithmetic operations (+, -, *, Abs,
  Sqr, Succ, Pred, Inc, and Dec) are
  checked for overflow. The code for
  each of these integer arithmetic
  operations is followed by additional
  code that verifies that the result is
  within the supported range. If an
  overflow check fails, an EIntOverflow
  exception is raised (or the program is
  terminated if exception handling is
  not enabled).
The $Q switch is usually used in
  conjunction with the $R switch, which
  enables and disables the generation of
  range-checking code. Enabling overflow
  checking slows down your program and
  makes it somewhat larger, so use {$Q+}
  only for debugging.

How do i use $OVERFLOWCHECKS OFF to disable the generation of overflow checking code?

Mason's answer worked. The revised code is:
var
    t1, t2, delta: DWORD:
begin
   t1 := 0xffffff00;
   t2 := 0x00000037;

   delta := Subtract(t2, t1);


{$OVERFLOWCHECKS OFF}
function Subtract(const B, A: DWORD): DWORD; //subtract B-A
begin
   {
      Disabling overflow checking does not work at the line level,
      only the routine level. 
      Hence the function to subtract two numbers.
   }
   Result := (B-A);
end;
{$OVERFLOWCHECKS ON}

Is there a way or a work-around to create an index on such a view?
",Creating an index on a view with OpenQuery,"['sql-server', 't-sql', 'indexing', 'query-optimization']",5/4/2010 18:54,3537,2768338,3,"<p>The best you could do would be to schedule a periodic export of the AD data you are interested in to a table.</p>

<p>The table could of course then have all the indexes you like. If you ran the export every 10 minutes and the possibility of getting data that is 9 minutes and 59 seconds out of date is not a problem, then your queries will be lightning fast.</p>

<p>The only part of concern would be managing locking and concurrency during the export time. One strategy might be to export the data into a new table and then through renames swap it into place. Another might be to use SYNONYMs (SQL 2005 and up) to do something similar where you just point the SYNONYM to two alternating tables.</p>

<p>The data that supplies the query you're performing comes from a completely different system outside of SQL Server. There's no way that SQL Server can create an indexed view on data it does not own. For starters, how would it be notified when something had been changed so it could update its indexes? There would have to be some notification and update mechanism, which is implausible because SQL Server could not reasonably maintain ACID for such a distributed, slow, non-SQL server transaction to an outside system.</p>

<p>Thus my suggestion for mimicking such a thing through your own scheduled jobs that refresh the data every X minutes.</p>

<p>--Responding to your comment--</p>

<p>You can't tell whether a new user has been added without querying. If Active Directory supports some API that generates events, I've never heard of it.</p>

<p>But, each time you query, you could store the greatest creation time of all the users in a table, then through dynamic SQL, query only for new users with a creation date after that. This query should theoretically be very fast as it would pull very little data across the wire. You would just have to look into what the exact AD field would be for the creation date of the user and the syntax for conditions on that field.</p>

<p>If managing the dynamic SQL was too tough, a very simple vbscript, VB, or .Net application could also query active directory for you on a schedule and update the database.</p>

3511130,"Is it possible to mock the enterprise library 5 version of 'Database'? If so... how?
There is no IDatabase interface (which is a mystery as I though Microsoft P&P would be more on the ball about testability benefits of exposing such an interface).
I have a Repository class which used EntLib 5 Data Access Application Block.
I am retro fitting unit tests into this class and need to mock out the dependency on the Database object. This class is now passed the Database via its constructor and uses a Database object to perform operations on the Db. 
I use the following to resolve an instance of the Database to be passed to my Repository:
Container.RegisterType<IFooRepository, FooRepository>(
    new InjectionConstructor(
        EnterpriseLibraryContainer.Current.GetInstance<Database>(""FooDbConnStr"")
    )
);

I don't wish these unit tests to become integration tests.
I have tried using Moq to create a dynamic mock of the Database type, but this has proved tricky as Database requires a connection string and a DbProviderFactory in its constructor.  Maybe if there was such a thing as a MockDbProviderFactory.
This is the form that the unit test is taking:

Aside: I also find the use of a static logger class very difficult to test. Hopefully I am missing some trick here, but I must say I am disappointed with testability thus far.

2753559,"I create a Silverlight Chart, with the Silverlight 4 toolkit, the April release.
Consider the following chart:
 <Grid x:Name=""LayoutRoot"" Background=""White"">
  <Charting:Chart Title=""Chart to test"" Name=""MySuperChart"">
   <Charting:LineSeries x:Name=""MyLineSeries"" Title=""Something"" />
  </Charting:Chart>
 </Grid>

So far so good. I can access the Series in the chart by MySuperChart.Series[0] But when I try to reference MyLineSeries, it appears to be null.

Full view
","Silverlight 4 toolkit, charting and lineSeries is null","['silverlight', 'charts', 'silverlight-toolkit']",5/2/2010 13:17,2585,2757381,1,"<p>This is an interesting little gotcha.  It helps if you look a bit under the hood at how the variable <code>MyLineSeries</code> is created and assigned.  Navigate to the definition of the <code>InitializeComponent</code> method.  You will end up at the MainPage.g.cs generated file.  It will contain this field:-</p>

<pre><code>internal System.Windows.Controls.DataVisualization.Charting.LineSeries MyLineSeries;
</code></pre>

<p>and in the <code>InitializeComponent</code> you will find this line:-</p>

<pre><code>this.MyLineSeries = ((System.Windows.Controls.DataVisualization.Charting.LineSeries)(this.FindName(""MyLineSeries"")));
</code></pre>

<p>So on the surface of it by the time the call to <code>InitializeComponent</code> in your constructor has completed the <code>MyLineSeries</code> should have been assigned a value.  However as you can see its still null, hence it can be concluded that <code>FindName(""MyLineSeries"")</code> failed to find the series.  So the question is why did it fail?</p>

<p><strong>Why Doesn't FindName Work?</strong></p>

<p><code>FindName</code> searches what is refered to in the documentation as the ""object tree"", looking for an object that has the name specified (there are added complications of what are known as namescopes but that is not at play here).  Typically objects end up in the ""object tree"" through common base types like <code>Panel</code> or <code>ContentControl</code> which have propeties such as <code>Children</code> and <code>Child</code> respectively.  These properties are specified in the <code>ContentProperty</code> attribute on the classes which allows for the UI structure to be described more naturally.  E.g.:-</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Button x:Name=""MyButton""&gt;
  &lt;Image x:Name=""MyImage"" ... /&gt;
&lt;/Button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of </p>

<pre><code>&lt;Button x:Name=""MyButton""&gt;
  &lt;Button.Child&gt;
    &lt;Image x:Name=""MyImage"" ... /&gt;
  &lt;/Button.Child&gt;
&lt;/Button&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Chart</code> control, on the other hand, is not a simple <code>Panel</code> derivative and has a lot more work to do to build its UI.  In the case of the <code>Chart</code> the <code>ContentPropertyAttribute</code> specifies the <code>Series</code> collection parameter.  This allows your more natural Xaml:-</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Charting:Chart Title=""Chart to test"" Name=""MySuperChart""&gt;
  &lt;Charting:LineSeries x:Name=""MyLineSeries"" Title=""Something"" /&gt;
&lt;/Charting:Chart&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However because <code>Chart</code> has a lot of extra work in order do determine what exactly should be in the ""object tree"" that will represent its final UI the series collection items don't immediately become part of the ""object tree"".  As result the <code>FindName</code> in the <code>InitializeComponent</code> simply doesn't find them.</p>

<p><strong>Work Around - Option 1</strong></p>

<p>You could use your knowledge of the ordinal position of ""MyLineSeries"" in the chart to handle the assignment of a <code>MyLineSeries</code> variable in the constructor.  Remove the <code>x:Name=""MyLineSeries""</code> from the Xaml then in code:-</p>

<pre><code>public partial MainPage : UserControl
{
  private LineSeries MyLineSeries;

  public MainPage()
  {
    InitializeComponent();
    MyLineSeries = (LineSeries)MySuperChart.Series[0];
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Work Around - Option 2</strong></p>

<p>You could wait until the series is available in the ""object tree"" which is true once the containing <code>UserControl</code> has fired its <code>Loaded</code> event:-</p>

<pre><code>public partial MainPage : UserControl
{
  public MainPage()
  {
    InitializeComponent();
    Loaded += (s, args) =&gt;
    {
      MyLineSeries = (LineSeries)FindName(""MyLineSeries"");

2945508,"The IHideObjectMembers trick (a.k.a IFluentInterface) can be used e.g. in fluent interface implementations to hide System.Object members from IntelliSense. (If you don't know this trick, you can read up on it via the above link; I'm just repeating the interface's usual declaration here:)
using System;
using System.ComponentModel;

[EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
public interface IHideObjectMembers
{
    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)] bool Equals(object obj);
    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)] int GetHashCode();
    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)] Type GetType();
    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)] string ToString();
}

I'm now supposed to be able to hide System.Object members on another type as follows:
public class SomeClass : IHideObjectMembers { ... }

or:
public interface ISomeInterface : IHideObjectMembers { ... }

I tried this in both VS 2008 Express and VS 2008 Standard. However, no members are hidden from IntelliSense at all. I have used the EditorBrowsableAttribute in different projects and it always worked well; however, it doesn't work in this particular scenario.

If things had worked as expected, I would only have seen the SomeMethodTwo method.
Am I missing something?

P.S.: You can infer my example code from the declarations and the screenshot. I have a class SomeClass with a single dummy method called SomeMethodTwo. Very simple. I have not re-implemented the four System.Object methods in this class, as this should not be necessary.

Why does the following code execute even though the condition should have evaluated to false?

I have tried putting braces around the two conditions, and switching their position, but the EndedUsingApplication even still executes.
EDIT:
It has nothing to do with the || or && operators. Look at this...


Nobody can learn from my mistake unless I post the culprit code, so here it is.
  public static bool operator ==(ActiveApplication a, ActiveApplication b)
     {
     if ((object)a == null || (object)b == null)
        return false;
     return a.process_name == b.process_name && a.window_title == b.window_title;
     }

  public static bool operator !=(ActiveApplication a, ActiveApplication b)
     {
     return a == b ? false : true;
     }

And here is the working code ...
  public static bool operator ==(ActiveApplication a, ActiveApplication b)
     {
     // Casting to object class prevents this comparison operator being executed
     // again and causing an infinite loop (which I think .NET detects and stops
     // but it would still be a huge hole in the logic.
     if ((object)a == null && (object)b == null)
        return true;
     if ((object)a == null ^ (object)b == null)
        return false;
     return a.process_name == b.process_name && a.window_title == b.window_title;
     }

  public static bool operator !=(ActiveApplication a, ActiveApplication b)
     {
     return a == b ? false : true;
     }

The problem appeared to be when the != operator received two null values.

1555433,"I'm working with a complicated xml schema, for which I have created a class structure using xsd.exe (with some effort).  I can now reliably deserialize the xml into the generated class structure.  For example, consider the following xml from the web service:
<ODM FileType=""Snapshot"" CreationDateTime=""2009-10-09T19:58:46.5967434Z"" ODMVersion=""1.3.0"" SourceSystem=""XXX"" SourceSystemVersion=""999"">
  <Study OID=""2"">
    <GlobalVariables>
      <StudyName>Test1</StudyName>
      <StudyDescription/>
      <ProtocolName>Test0001</ProtocolName>
    </GlobalVariables>
    <MetaDataVersion OID=""1"" Name=""Base Version"" Description=""""/>
    <MetaDataVersion OID=""2"" Name=""Test0001"" Description=""""/>
    <MetaDataVersion OID=""3"" Name=""Test0002"" Description=""""/>
  </Study>
</ODM>

I can deserialize the xml as follows:
public ODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudy GetStudy(string studyId)
{
  ODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudy study = null;
  ODM odm = Deserialize<ODM>(Service.GetStudy(studyId));
  if (odm.Study.Length > 0)
    study = odm.Study[0];
  return study;
}

Service.GetStudy() returns an HTTPResponse stream from the web service.  And Deserialize() is a helper method that deserializes the stream into the object type T.  
My question is this: is it more efficient to let the deserialization process create the entire class structure and deserialize the xml, or is it more efficient to grab only the xml of interest and deserialize that xml.  For example, I could replace the above code with:
public ODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudy GetStudy(string studyId)
{
  ODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudy study = null;
  using (XmlReader reader = XmlReader.Create(Service.GetStudy(studyId)))
  {
    XDocument xdoc = XDocument.Load(reader);
    XNamespace odmns = xdoc.Root.Name.Namespace;
    XElement elStudy = xdoc.Root.Element(odmns + ""Study"");
    study = Deserialize<ODMcomplexTypeDefinitionStudy>(elStudy.ToString());
  }
return study;
}

I suspect that the first approach is preferred -- there is a lot of dom manipulation going on in the second example, and the deserialization process must have optimizations; however, what happens when the xml grows dramatically?  Let's say the source returns 1 MB of xml and I'm really only interested in a very small component of that xml.  Should I let the deserialzation process fill up the containing ODM class with all it's arrays and properties of child nodes?  Or just go get the child node as in the second example!!??
Not sure this helps, but here's a summary image of the dilemma:

",Efficiency of deserialization vs. XmlReader,"['serialization', 'xmlreader']",10/12/2009 16:05,1351,1555486,2,"<p>Brett,</p>

<p>Later versions of .net will build custom serializer assemblies. Click on project properties -> build and look for ""Generate serialization assemblies"" and change to On. The XML deserializer will use these assemblies which are customized to the classes in your project. They are much faster and less resource intensive since reflection is not involved.</p>

<p>I would go this route so that if you class changes you will not have to worry about serialization issues. Performance should not be an issue.</p>

The second if statement works as expected; 1.0 is not less than 1.0.  Now, the first if statement evaluates as true.  The very odd thing is that when I hover over the if, the intellisense tells me false, yet the code happily moves to the Console.WriteLine.
This is for C# 3.5 in Visual Studio 2008.
Is this a floating point accuracy problem?  Then why does the second if statement work?  I feel I am missing something very fundamental here.
Any insight is appreciated.
Edit2 (Re-purposing question a little bit):
I can accept the math precision problem, but my question now is: why does the hover over evaluate properly?  This is also true of the immediate window.  I paste the code from the first if statement into the immediate window and it evaluates false.
Update
First of all, thanks very much for all the great answers.
I am also having problems recreating this in another project on the same machine.  Looking at the project settings, I see no differences.  Looking at the IL between the projects, I see no differences.  Looking at the disassembly, I see no apparent differences (besides memory addresses).  Yet when I debug the original project, I see:


The immediate window tells me the if is false, yet the code falls into the conditional.
At any rate, the best answer, I think, is to prepare for floating point arithmetic in these situations.  The reason I couldn't let this go has more to do with the debugger's calculations differing from the runtime.  So thanks very much to Brian Gideon and stephentyrone for some very insightful comments.

958932,"I am using Microsoft Text-to-Text Speech feature in my project. But I have a question about that, actually not directly about that. So :
Normally programmers when creating Interface, they put I as a prefix of the interface name like IReadable,IEnumerator etc. But I've come across something that actually shocked me.
in Microsoft Text Speech DLL there is something like this : SpVoice which is interface (they didn't put I as prefix for some reason and I don't know why ?) and SpVoiceClass. So then what's the problem you may ask, Here : 
SpVoice speak= new SpVoice(); //I created an object from SpVoice Interface
speak.Speak(""Hello StackOverFlow""); //and it speaks and say exactly what I write.

and
SpVoiceClass speak =  new SpVoiceClass();
speak.Speak(""Hello Kowanichi""); //and it does the same thing.

The thing I don't get is how ? How does the first one work although it says it is an interface with tons of unimplemented methods etc.
Please some one explain me HOW ?
I am really confused now and maybe Microsoft developers didn't put I prefix for that reason, it can be instantiated. 
Thanks in advance. 
Hope I describe my problem clearly.

Their explanation on this misleading error message is as following

Note:
  It is recognized that the
  message for Msg 313 is misleading and
  does not convey the actual cause of
  the failure. This awkward usage stems
  from the inability to raise an
  explicit error from within a TVF.
  Nevertheless, the value of returning a
  recognizable, if inaccurate, error was
  deemed preferable to simply returning
  an empty result. An empty result set
  would not be distinguishable from a
  valid query returning no changes.

Here is a demonstration of what the note meant RAISERROR

There are times when I'd like to throw an error and you cannot use TRY..CATCH within UDF since it also has a side-effect like RAISERROR.
  
Now the question is, how do you get around this problem? 
I am sure that you have faced with this restriction before. 
What alternative would you suggest?

It works perfectly with both themes that ship with Wordpress: looking good using WordPress Default 1.6 and looking equally good with the WordPress Classic 1.5 theme.
However it doesn't work with the excellent LightWord theme, which I would like to use. The code box looks strange with the right border at the end of the actual code:

My thoughts:
I have tried investigating this with Firebug without any success. The CSS from the WP-Syntax plugin should be the same in all three theme cases. So the fact that it looks wierd with this theme has to do with some inherited CSS property from the LightWord theme.
This in turn probably means that the WP-Syntax plugin should reset something more for its CSS to work correctly.

Advanced CSS isn't something I'm good at. But I would very much like to resolve this problem as soon as possible. I'm also curious from a technical view point what could be causing this behavior? I hope someone with good CSS skills will be able to help out!
We (you if you want to, me if you don't feel like it) could then file a bug report in the appropriate place, to get these components working together.

Summary of problems I'd like to solve:

What's the best way to get rid of the right and bottom inner border in the code box? I first noticed the right border, but the bottom border is also an eye sore.
The code box right border isn't visible. It's due to .wp_syntax {width:100%;} and if I set it to 99% it's visible again. Do you consider this to be a problem with the theme or the plugin?
Making changes in the theme (style.css) or the plugin (wp-syntax.css) would be preferred if that's possible, so one of them could be standard. But which one? And how?

",Fix a CSS problem with a Wordpress theme and a syntax highlighting plugin,"['css', 'xhtml']",7/13/2009 18:46,679,1121419,1,"<p>The problems you are having are due to the stylesheets of WP-Syntax and LightWord interfering with each other. I don't really think that the problems are with the theme or the plugin, they are just down to how the two interact with each other.</p>

<p>To make all of the required changes, ideally you would edit styles in both <a href=""http://kentlarsson.eu/lightword-problem/wp-syntax.css"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wp-syntax.css</a> and <a href=""http://kentlarsson.eu/blog/wp-content/themes/lightword/style.css"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">style.css</a>. You can however cheat a little.</p>

<p>In <b>style.css</b> add the following:
<pre><code>.wp_syntax { width:auto; }</p>

<p>.wp_syntax table { border:0 !important; }</p>

<p>.wp_syntax table td { border:0 !important; }
</pre></code></p>

<p>These changes should solve all of the problems, with the benefit of keeping all of the changes localised to a single file (style.css of the LightWood theme). The other tables in the example should all remain unchanged as well.</p>

<li>Right-click on the rounded button in the MyOverlayView to bring up the connections inspector.</li>
<li>Left-drag from the circle next to the ""Touch up inside"" event to the ""Local"" tab button in the TabBarController window. Interface Builder interprets this as you wanting to make a connection to the UIViewController subclass that is managing that tab - in this case MyMovieController.</li>
<li>From the popup that appears when you release the mouse button, select the IBAction that you want to connect the event to. It was connected to the OverlayViewButtonPressed action. If you look at the code, that function does nothing, but you can put some stuff in there and amuse yourself.

I'm trying to make my own limited/specialized version of XAMLPad.  
Displaying the current XAML object tree in the top display is simple enough, using XamlReader.Parse() ... But I'd like the actual XAML code in the bottom window to show up in its appropriate colors.  
Here is an example of something similar to what I want.

(source: usefulfreeware.net) 
The above example looks pretty authentic, with the little expander/collapser thingies on the left side as well as close-to-standard coloration of XAML tokens.  
I believe that this doesn't have to be created from scratch, so I'm asking SO if anyone knows where I might find automated support for this type of ""code"" display.

EDIT 2:
Ive been reading about someone with a similar problem, caused by a view being loaded incorrectly. link text I am doing something perhaps a little odd. In order to use the graph library from a tab bar, I load my date range view and then show the graph in viewDidLoad, then once the graph is closed the date range view remains. The user can then click view graph again to show the graph with different dates. If I don`t do this my view will be blank when the graph is closed. So heres how Im calling the graph.

I`m reusing the date range screen elsewhere so the graph may not be shown.
Any further suggestions ?

}

if use oleksiy.t method :
 public class GenoTipController
    {


        public object CreateByEnum(DataModelType modeltype)
        {
            string enumText = modeltype.ToString(); // will return for example ""Company""
            Type classType = Type.GetType(enumText); // the Type for Company class
            object t = Activator.CreateInstance(classType); // create an instance of Company class

            return t;
        }
    }

    public class CompanyView
    {
        public static List<Personel> GetPersonel()
        {
            GenoTipController controller = new GenoTipController();
            _Company company = controller.CreateByEnum(DataModelType.Company);
             return company.GetPersonel();

        }
   }
    public enum DataModelType
    {
        Radyoloji,
        Satis,
        Muayene,
        Company
    }


i face to face error: i like oleksiy method but how can i use it?
