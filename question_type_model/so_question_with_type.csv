2067,"Both of these frameworks aim to seperate concerns - for instance, interaction with a data source (model), application logic (or turning this data into useful information) (Controller/Presenter) and display code (View). In some cases the model can also be used to turn a data source into a higher level abstraction as well. A good example of this is the MVC Storefront project. There is a discussion here regarding the differences between MVC vs MVP. The distinction made is that in an MVC application traditionally has the view and the controller interact with the model, but not with each other. MVP designs have the Presenter access the model and interact with the view. Having said that, ASP.NET MVC is by these definitions an MVP framework because the Controller accesses the Model to populate the View which is meant to have no logic (just  displays the variables provided by the Controller).

3082,"Wikipedia Article. To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure. Instead of your program explicitly controlling everything, your program sets up a class or library with certain functions to be called when certain things happen. It solves code duplication. For example, in the old days you would manually write your own event loop, polling the system libraries for new events. Nowadays, most modern APIs you simply tell the system libraries what events you're interested in, and it will let you know when they happen. Inversion of control is a practical way to reduce code duplication, and if you find yourself copying an entire method and only changing a small piece of the code, you can consider tackling it with inversion of control. Inversion of control is made easy in many languages through the concept of delegates, interfaces, or even raw function pointers. It is not appropriate to use in all cases, because the flow of a program can be harder to follow when written this way. It's a useful way to design methods when writing a library that will be reused, but it should be used sparingly in the core of your own program unless it really solves a code duplication problem.",3058,1,"['oop', 'design-patterns', 'inversion-of-control']",What is Inversion of Control?,"[{'sentence': 'Wikipedia Article.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'To me, inversion of control is turning your sequentially written code and turning it into an delegation structure.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'Instead of your program explicitly controlling everything, your program sets up a class or library with certain functions to be called when certain things happen.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'It solves code duplication.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'For example, in the old days you would manually write your own event loop, polling the system libraries for new events.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': ""Nowadays, most modern APIs you simply tell the system libraries what events you're interested in, and it will let you know when they happen."", 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'Inversion of control is a practical way to reduce code duplication, and if you find yourself copying an entire method and only changing a small piece of the code, you can consider tackling it with inversion of control.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'Inversion of control is made easy in many languages through the concept of delegates, interfaces, or even raw function pointers.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'It is not appropriate to use in all cases, because the flow of a program can be harder to follow when written this way.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': ""It's a useful way to design methods when writing a library that will be reused, but it should be used sparingly in the core of your own program unless it really solves a code duplication problem."", 'truth': 0}]"

75238,"This is implementation dependent, as the C standard does NOT define the signed-ness of <code>char</code>.

86052,"(This answer has been updated to match SVN 1.8 and 1.9's behaviour) You have 2 questions: Marking files as ignored: By ""ignored file"" I mean the file won't appear in lists even as ""unversioned"": your SVN client will pretend the file doesn't exist at all in the filesystem. Ignored files are specified by a ""file pattern"". The syntax and format of file patterns is explained in SVN's online documentation: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.advanced.props.special.ignore.html ""File Patterns in Subversion"". Subversion, as of version 1.8 (June 2013) and later, supports 3 different ways of specifying file patterns. Here's a summary with examples: 1 - Runtime Configuration Area - <code>global-ignores</code> option: This is a client-side only setting, so your <code>global-ignores</code> list won't be shared by other users, and it applies to all repos you checkout onto your computer. This setting is defined in your Runtime Configuration Area file: Windows (file-based) - <code>C:\Users\{you}\AppData\Roaming\Subversion\config</code> Windows (registry-based) - <code>Software\Tigris.org\Subversion\Config\Miscellany\global-ignores</code> in both <code>HKLM</code> and <code>HKCU</code>. Linux/Unix - <code>~/.subversion/config</code> 2 - The <code>svn:ignore</code> property, which is set on directories (not files): This is stored within the repo, so other users will have the same ignore files. Similar to how <code>.gitignore</code> works. <code>svn:ignore</code> is applied to directories and is non-recursive or inherited. Any file or immediate subdirectory of the parent directory that matches the File Pattern will be excluded. While SVN 1.8 adds the concept of ""inherited properties"", the <code>svn:ignore</code> property itself is ignored in non-immediate descendant directories: (So the file <code>./subdirectory/ignoreThis</code> is not ignored, even though ""<code>ignoreThis.txt</code>"" is applied on the <code>.</code> repo root). Therefore, to apply an ignore list recursively you must use <code>svn propset svn:ignore &lt;filePattern&gt; . --recursive</code>. This will create a copy of the property on every subdirectory. If the <code>&lt;filePattern&gt;</code> value is different in a child directory then the child's value completely overrides the parents, so there is no ""additive"" effect. So if you change the <code>&lt;filePattern&gt;</code> on the root <code>.</code>, then you must change it with <code>--recursive</code> to overwrite it on the child and descendant directories. I note that the command-line syntax is counter-intuitive. I started-off assuming that you would ignore a file in SVN by typing something like <code>svn ignore pathToFileToIgnore.txt</code> however this is not how SVN's ignore feature works. 3- The <code>svn:global-ignores</code> property. Requires SVN 1.8 (June 2013): This is similar to <code>svn:ignore</code>, except it makes use of SVN 1.8's ""inherited properties"" feature. Compare to <code>svn:ignore</code>, the file pattern is automatically applied in every descendant directory (not just immediate children). This means that is unnecessary to set <code>svn:global-ignores</code> with the <code>--recursive</code> flag, as inherited ignore file patterns are automatically applied as they're inherited. Running the same set of commands as in the previous example, but using <code>svn:global-ignores</code> instead: For TortoiseSVN users: This whole arrangement was confusing for me, because TortoiseSVN's terminology (as used in their Windows Explorer menu system) was initially misleading to me - I was unsure what the significance of the Ignore menu's ""Add  recursively"", ""Add *"" and ""Add "" options. I hope this post explains how the Ignore feature ties-in to the SVN Properties feature. That said, I suggest using the command-line to set ignored files so you get a feel for how it works instead of using the GUI, and only using the GUI to manipulate properties after you're comfortable with the command-line. Listing files that are ignored: The command <code>svn status</code> will hide ignored files (that is, files that match an RGA <code>global-ignores</code> pattern, or match an immediate parent directory's <code>svn:ignore</code> pattern or match any ancesor directory's <code>svn:global-ignores</code> pattern. Use the <code>--no-ignore</code> option to see those files listed. Ignored files have a status of <code>I</code>, then pipe the output to <code>grep</code> to only show lines starting with ""I"".

109025,"This is known as the 'Hamming Weight', 'popcount' or 'sideways addition'. The 'best' algorithm really depends on which CPU you are on and what your usage pattern is. Some CPUs have a single built-in instruction to do it and others have parallel instructions which act on bit vectors. The parallel instructions (like x86's <code>popcnt</code>, on CPUs where it's supported) will almost certainly be fastest. Some other architectures may have a slow instruction implemented with a microcoded loop that tests a bit per cycle (citation needed). A pre-populated table lookup method can be very fast if your CPU has a large cache and/or you are doing lots of these instructions in a tight loop. However it can suffer because of the expense of a 'cache miss', where the CPU has to fetch some of the table from main memory. If you know that your bytes will be mostly 0's or mostly 1's then there are very efficient algorithms for these scenarios. I believe a very good general purpose algorithm is the following, known as 'parallel' or 'variable-precision SWAR algorithm'. I have expressed this in a C-like pseudo language, you may need to adjust it to work for a particular language (e.g. using uint32_t for C++ and >>> in Java): This has the best worst-case behaviour of any of the algorithms discussed, so will efficiently deal with any usage pattern or values you throw at it. This bitwise-SWAR algorithm could parallelize to be done in multiple vector elements at once, instead of in a single integer register, for a speedup on CPUs with SIMD but no usable popcount instruction. (e.g. x86-64 code that has to run on any CPU, not just Nehalem or later.) However, the best way to use vector instructions for popcount is usually by using a variable-shuffle to do a table-lookup for 4 bits at a time of each byte in parallel. (The 4 bits index a 16 entry table held in a vector register). On Intel CPUs, the hardware 64bit popcnt instruction can outperform an SSSE3 <code>PSHUFB</code> bit-parallel implementation by about a factor of 2, but only if your compiler gets it just right. Otherwise SSE can come out significantly ahead. Newer compiler versions are aware of the popcnt false dependency problem on Intel.

141576,"Let's say we have a single byte: Applying a single left bitshift gets us: The leftmost zero was shifted out of the byte, and a new zero was appended to the right end of the byte. The bits don't rollover; they are discarded. That means if you left shift 1101100 and then right shift it, you won't get the same result back. Shifting left by N is equivalent to multiplying by 2N. Shifting right by N is (if you are using ones' complement) is the equivalent of dividing by 2N and rounding to zero. Bitshifting can be used for insanely fast multiplication and division, provided you are working with a power of 2. Almost all low-level graphics routines use bitshifting. For example, way back in the olden days, we used mode 13h (320x200 256 colors) for games. In Mode 13h, the video memory was laid out sequentially per pixel. That meant to calculate the location for a pixel, you would use the following math: Now, back in that day and age, speed was critical, so we would use bitshifts to do this operation. However, 320 is not a power of two, so to get around this we have to find out what is a power of two that added together makes 320: Now we can convert that into left shifts: For a final result of: Now we get the same offset as before, except instead of an expensive multiplication operation, we use the two bitshifts...in x86 it would be something like this (note, it's been forever since I've done assembly (editor's note: corrected a couple mistakes and added a 32-bit example)): Total: 28 cycles on whatever ancient CPU had these timings. Vrs 12 cycles on the same ancient CPU. Yes, we would work this hard to shave off 16 CPU cycles. In 32 or 64-bit mode, both versions get a lot shorter and faster. Modern out-of-order execution CPUs like Intel Skylake (see http://agner.org/optimize/) have very fast hardware multiply (low latency and high throughput), so the gain is much smaller. AMD Bulldozer-family is a bit slower, especially for 64-bit multiply. On Intel CPUs, and AMD Ryzen, two shifts are slightly lower latency but more instructions than a multiply (which may lead to lower throughput): vs. Compilers will do this for you: See how gcc, clang, and MSVC all use shift+lea when optimizing <code>return 320*row + col;</code>. The most interesting thing to note here is that x86 has a shift-and-add instruction (<code>LEA</code>) that can do small left shifts and add at the same time, with the performance as and <code>add</code> instruction. ARM is even more powerful: one operand of any instruction can be left or right shifted for free. So scaling by a compile-time-constant that's known to be a power-of-2 can be even more efficient than a multiply. OK, back in the modern days... something more useful now would be to use bitshifting to store two 8-bit values in a 16-bit integer.

383699,"JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format that is used for data interchanging. It is based on a subset of JavaScript language (the way objects are built in JavaScript). As stated in the MDN, some JavaScript is not JSON, and some JSON is not JavaScript. An example of  where this is used is web services responses. In the 'old' days, web services used XML as their primary data format for transmitting back data, but since JSON appeared (The JSON format is specified in RFC 4627 by Douglas Crockford), it has been the preferred format because it is much more lightweight You can find a lot more info on the official JSON web site. JSON is built on two structures: A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary, hash table, keyed list, or associative array. An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence. JSON Structure Here is an example of JSON data: JSON in JavaScript JSON (in Javascript) is a string! People often assume all Javascript objects are JSON and that JSON is a Javascript object. This is incorrect. In Javascript <code>var x = {x:y}</code> is not JSON, this is a Javascript object. The two are not the same thing. The JSON equivalent (represented in the Javascript language) would be <code>var x = '{""x"":""y""}'</code>. <code>x</code> is an object of type string not an object in it's own right. To turn this into a fully fledged Javascript object you must first parse it, <code>var x = JSON.parse('{""x"":""y""}');</code>, <code>x</code> is now an object but this is not JSON anymore. See Javascript object Vs JSON When working with JSON and JavaScript, you may be tempted to use the <code>eval</code> function to evaluate the result returned in the callback, but this is not suggested since there are two characters (U+2028 &amp; U+2029) valid in JSON but not in JavaScript (read more of this here). Therefore, one must always try to use Crockford's script that checks for a valid JSON before evaluating it. Link to the script explanation is found here and here is a direct link to the js file. Every major browser nowadays has its own implementation for this. Example on how to use the JSON parser (with the json from the above code snippet): The JSON parser also offers another very useful method, <code>stringify</code>. This method accepts a JavaScript object as a parameter, and outputs back a string with JSON format. This is useful for when you want to send data back to the server: The above two methods (<code>parse</code> and <code>stringify</code>) also take a second parameter, which is a function that will be called for every key and value at every level of the final result, and each value will be replaced by result of your inputted function. (More on this here) Btw, for all of you out there who think JSON is just for JavaScript, check out this post that explains and confirms otherwise.

1028551,"OK, from background knowledge and from reading the Wikipedia page to which you pointed, it appears that reactive programming is something like dataflow computing but with specific external ""stimuli"" triggering a set of nodes to fire and perform their computations. This is pretty well suited to UI design, for example, in which touching a user interface control (say, the volume control on a music playing application) might need to update various display items and the actual volume of audio output. When you modify the volume (a slider, let's say) that would correspond to modifying the value associated with a node in a directed graph. Various nodes having edges from that ""volume value"" node would automatically be triggered and any necessary computations and updates would naturally ripple through the application. The application ""reacts"" to the user stimulus. Functional reactive programming would just be the implementation of this idea in a functional language, or generally within a functional programming paradigm. For more on ""dataflow computing"", search for those two words on Wikipedia or using your favorite search engine. The general idea is this: the program is a directed graph of nodes, each performing some simple computation. These nodes are connected to each other by graph links that provide the outputs of some nodes to the inputs of others. When a node fires or performs its calculation, the nodes connected to its outputs have their corresponding inputs ""triggered"" or ""marked"". Any node having all inputs triggered/marked/available automatically fires. The graph might be implicit or explicit depending on exactly how reactive programming is implemented. Nodes can be looked at as firing in parallel, but often they are executed serially or with limited parallelism (for example, there may be a few threads executing them). A famous example was the Manchester Dataflow Machine, which (IIRC) used a tagged data architecture to schedule execution of nodes in the graph through one or more execution units. Dataflow computing is fairly well suited to situations in which triggering computations asynchronously giving rise to cascades of computations works better than trying to have execution be governed by a clock (or clocks). Reactive programming imports this ""cascade of execution"" idea and seems to think of the program in a dataflow-like fashion but with the proviso that some of the nodes are hooked to the ""outside world"" and the cascades of execution are triggered when these sensory-like nodes change. Program execution would then look like something analogous to a complex reflex arc. The program may or may not be basically sessile between stimuli or may settle into a basically sessile state between stimuli. ""non-reactive"" programming would be programming with a very different view of the flow of execution and relationship to external inputs. It's likely to be somewhat subjective, since people will likely be tempted to say anything that responds to external inputs ""reacts"" to them. But looking at the spirit of the thing, a program that polls an event queue at a fixed interval and dispatches any events found to functions (or threads) is less reactive (because it only attends to user input at a fixed interval). Again, it's the spirit of the thing here: one can imagine putting a polling implementation with a fast polling interval into a system at a very low level and program in a reactive fashion on top of it.",1028250,1,"['functional-programming', 'terminology', 'reactive-programming', 'frp']",What is (functional) reactive programming?,"[{'sentence': 'OK, from background knowledge and from reading the Wikipedia page to which you pointed, it appears that reactive programming is something like dataflow computing but with specific external ""stimuli"" triggering a set of nodes to fire and perform their computations.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'This is pretty well suited to UI design, for example, in which touching a user interface control (say, the volume control on a music playing application) might need to update various display items and the actual volume of audio output.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': ""When you modify the volume (a slider, let's say) that would correspond to modifying the value associated with a node in a directed graph."", 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'Various nodes having edges from that ""volume value"" node would automatically be triggered and any necessary computations and updates would naturally ripple through the application.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'The application ""reacts"" to the user stimulus.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'Functional reactive programming would just be the implementation of this idea in a functional language, or generally within a functional programming paradigm.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'For more on ""dataflow computing"", search for those two words on Wikipedia or using your favorite search engine.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'The general idea is this: the program is a directed graph of nodes, each performing some simple computation.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'These nodes are connected to each other by graph links that provide the outputs of some nodes to the inputs of others.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'When a node fires or performs its calculation, the nodes connected to its outputs have their corresponding inputs ""triggered"" or ""marked"".', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'Any node having all inputs triggered/marked/available automatically fires.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'The graph might be implicit or explicit depending on exactly how reactive programming is implemented.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'Nodes can be looked at as firing in parallel, but often they are executed serially or with limited parallelism (for example, there may be a few threads executing them).', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'A famous example was the Manchester Dataflow Machine, which (IIRC) used a tagged data architecture to schedule execution of nodes in the graph through one or more execution units.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'Dataflow computing is fairly well suited to situations in which triggering computations asynchronously giving rise to cascades of computations works better than trying to have execution be governed by a clock (or clocks).', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'Reactive programming imports this ""cascade of execution"" idea and seems to think of the program in a dataflow-like fashion but with the proviso that some of the nodes are hooked to the ""outside world"" and the cascades of execution are triggered when these sensory-like nodes change.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'Program execution would then look like something analogous to a complex reflex arc.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'The program may or may not be basically sessile between stimuli or may settle into a basically sessile state between stimuli.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '""non-reactive"" programming would be programming with a very different view of the flow of execution and relationship to external inputs.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'It\'s likely to be somewhat subjective, since people will likely be tempted to say anything that responds to external inputs ""reacts"" to them.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'But looking at the spirit of the thing, a program that polls an event queue at a fixed interval and dispatches any events found to functions (or threads) is less reactive (because it only attends to user input at a fixed interval).', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': ""Again, it's the spirit of the thing here: one can imagine putting a polling implementation with a fast polling interval into a system at a very low level and program in a reactive fashion on top of it."", 'truth': 1}]"

When you invoke an EXE file like this with complex command line arguments it is usually very helpful to have a tool that will show you how PowerShell sends the arguments to the EXE file. The PowerShell Community Extensions has such a tool. It is called echoargs. You just replace the EXE file with echoargs - leaving all the arguments in place, and it will show you how the EXE file will receive the arguments, for example: Using echoargs you can experiment until you get it right, for example: It turns out I was trying too hard before to maintain the double quotes around the connection string.

Multiple items are a violation of contract, an exception is thrown. <strong>Performance Difference</strong> <li><code>FirstOrDefault</code> is usually faster, it iterates until it finds the element and only has to iterate the whole enumerable when it doesn't find it. In many cases, there is a high probability to find an item. <li><code>SingleOrDefault</code> needs to check if there is only one element and therefore always iterates the whole enumerable. To be precise, it iterates until it finds a second element and throws an exception. But in most cases, there is no second element. <strong>Conclusion</strong> <li>Use <code>FirstOrDefault</code> if you don't care how many items there are <strong>or</strong> when you can't afford checking uniqueness (e.g. in a very large collection).

2424824,"Introduction To browse and select a file for upload you need a HTML <code>&lt;input type=""file""&gt;</code> field in the form. As stated in the HTML specification you have to use the <code>POST</code> method and the <code>enctype</code> attribute of the form has to be set to <code>""multipart/form-data""</code>. After submitting such a form, the binary multipart form data is available in the request body in a different format than when the <code>enctype</code> isn't set. Before Servlet 3.0, the Servlet API didn't natively support <code>multipart/form-data</code>. It supports only the default form enctype of <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>. The <code>request.getParameter()</code> and consorts would all return <code>null</code> when using multipart form data. This is where the well known Apache Commons FileUpload came into the picture. Don't manually parse it! You can in theory parse the request body yourself based on <code>ServletRequest#getInputStream()</code>. However, this is a precise and tedious work which requires precise knowledge of RFC2388. You shouldn't try to do this on your own or copypaste some homegrown library-less code found elsewhere on the Internet. Many online sources have failed hard in this, such as roseindia.net. See also uploading of pdf file. You should rather use a real library which is used (and implicitly tested!) by millions of users for years. Such a library has proven its robustness. When you're already on Servlet 3.0 or newer, use native API If you're using at least Servlet 3.0 (Tomcat 7, Jetty 9, JBoss AS 6, GlassFish 3, etc), then you can just use standard API provided <code>HttpServletRequest#getPart()</code> to collect the individual multipart form data items (most Servlet 3.0 implementations actually use Apache Commons FileUpload under the covers for this!). Also, normal form fields are available by <code>getParameter()</code> the usual way. First annotate your servlet with <code>@MultipartConfig</code> in order to let it recognize and support <code>multipart/form-data</code> requests and thus get <code>getPart()</code> to work: Then, implement its <code>doPost()</code> as follows: Note the <code>Path#getFileName()</code>. This is a MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. In case you have a <code>&lt;input type=""file"" name=""file"" multiple=""true"" /&gt;</code> for multi-file upload, collect them as below (unfortunately there is no such method as <code>request.getParts(""file"")</code>): When you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, manually get submitted file name Note that <code>Part#getSubmittedFileName()</code> was introduced in Servlet 3.1 (Tomcat 8, Jetty 9, WildFly 8, GlassFish 4, etc). If you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, then you need an additional utility method to obtain the submitted file name. Note the MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. When you're not on Servlet 3.0 yet, use Apache Commons FileUpload If you're not on Servlet 3.0 yet (isn't it about time to upgrade? ), the common practice is to make use of Apache Commons FileUpload to parse the multpart form data requests. It has an excellent User Guide and FAQ (carefully go through both). There's also the O'Reilly (""cos"") <code>MultipartRequest</code>, but it has some (minor) bugs and isn't actively maintained anymore for years. I wouldn't recommend using it. Apache Commons FileUpload is still actively maintained and currently very mature. In order to use Apache Commons FileUpload, you need to have at least the following files in your webapp's <code>/WEB-INF/lib</code>: <code>commons-fileupload.jar</code> <code>commons-io.jar</code> Your initial attempt failed most likely because you forgot the commons IO. Here's a kickoff example how the <code>doPost()</code> of your <code>UploadServlet</code> may look like when using Apache Commons FileUpload: It's very important that you don't call <code>getParameter()</code>, <code>getParameterMap()</code>, <code>getParameterValues()</code>, <code>getInputStream()</code>, <code>getReader()</code>, etc on the same request beforehand. Otherwise the servlet container will read and parse the request body and thus Apache Commons FileUpload will get an empty request body. See also a.o. ServletFileUpload#parseRequest(request) returns an empty list. Note the <code>FilenameUtils#getName()</code>. This is a MSIE fix as to obtaining the file name. This browser incorrectly sends the full file path along the name instead of only the file name. Alternatively you can also wrap this all in a <code>Filter</code> which parses it all automagically and put the stuff back in the parametermap of the request so that you can continue using <code>request.getParameter()</code> the usual way and retrieve the uploaded file by <code>request.getAttribute()</code>. You can find an example in this blog article. Workaround for GlassFish3 bug of <code>getParameter()</code> still returning <code>null</code> Note that Glassfish versions older than 3.1.2 had a bug wherein the <code>getParameter()</code> still returns <code>null</code>.

2480744,"Two different kinds of parameters can  be adjusted during the training of an  ANN, the weights and the value in the  activation functions. This is  impractical and it would be easier if  only one of the parameters should be  adjusted. To cope with this problem a  bias neuron is invented. The bias  neuron lies in one layer, is connected  to all the neurons in the next layer,  but none in the previous layer and it  always emits 1. Since the bias neuron  emits 1 the weights, connected to the  bias neuron, are added directly to the  combined sum of the other weights  (equation 2.1), just like the t value  in the activation functions.1 The reason it's impractical is because you're simultaneously adjusting the weight and the value, so any change to the weight can neutralize the change to the value that was useful for a previous data instance... adding a bias neuron without a changing value allows you to control the behavior of the layer. Furthermore the bias allows you to use a single neural net to represent similar cases. Consider the AND boolean function represented by the following neural network: ANN http://www.aihorizon.com/images/essays/perceptron.gif <li><em>w0</em> corresponds to <em>b</em>. <li><em>w1</em> corresponds to <em>x1</em>. <li><em>w2</em> corresponds to <em>x2</em>. A single perceptron can be used to  represent many boolean functions. For example, if we assume boolean values  of 1 (true) and -1 (false), then one  way to use a two-input perceptron to  implement the AND function is to set  the weights w0 = -3, and w1 = w2 = .5. This perceptron can be made to  represent the OR function instead by  altering the threshold to w0 = -.3. In  fact, AND and OR can be viewed as  special cases of m-of-n functions:  that is, functions where at least m of  the n inputs to the perceptron must be  true. The OR function corresponds to  m = 1 and the AND function to m = n.  Any m-of-n function is easily  represented using a perceptron by  setting all input weights to the same  value (e.g., 0.5) and then setting the  threshold w0 accordingly. Perceptrons can represent all of the  primitive boolean functions AND, OR,  NAND ( 1 AND), and NOR ( 1 OR).

2726683,"A <code>LEFT JOIN</code> is absolutely not faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>. In fact, it's slower; by definition, an outer join (<code>LEFT JOIN</code> or <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>)  has to do all the work of an <code>INNER JOIN</code> plus the extra work of null-extending the results. It would also be expected to return more rows, further increasing the total execution time simply due to the larger size of the result set. (And even if a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> <em>were</em> faster in <em>specific</em> situations due to some difficult-to-imagine confluence of factors, it is not functionally equivalent to an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, so you cannot simply go replacing all instances of one with the other!) Most likely your performance problems lie elsewhere, such as not having a candidate key or foreign key indexed properly. 9 tables is quite a lot to be joining so the slowdown could literally be almost anywhere. If you post your schema, we might be able to provide more details. <strong>Edit:</strong> Reflecting further on this, I could think of one circumstance under which a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> might be faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, and that is when: <li>Some of the tables are <em>very</em> small (say, under 10 rows); <li>The tables do not have sufficient indexes to cover the query. Consider this example: BIGBLOCK If you run this and view the execution plan, you'll see that the <code>INNER JOIN</code> query does indeed cost more than the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, because it satisfies the two criteria above. It's because SQL Server wants to do a hash match for the <code>INNER JOIN</code>, but does nested loops for the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>; the former is <em>normally</em> much faster, but since the number of rows is so tiny <em>and</em> there's no index to use, the hashing operation turns out to be the most expensive part of the query. You can see the same effect by writing a program in your favourite programming language to perform a large number of lookups on a list with 5 elements, vs. a hash table with 5 elements. Because of the size, the hash table version is actually slower. But increase it to 50 elements, or 5000 elements, and the list version slows to a crawl, because it's O(N) vs. O(1) for the hashtable. But change this query to be on the <code>ID</code> column instead of <code>Name</code> and you'll see a very different story. In that case, it does nested loops for both queries, but the <code>INNER JOIN</code> version is able to replace one of the clustered index scans with a seek - meaning that this will literally be <em>an order of magnitude</em> faster with a large number of rows. So the conclusion is more or less what I mentioned several paragraphs above; this is almost certainly an indexing or index coverage problem, possibly combined with one or more very small tables. Those are the only circumstances under which SQL Server <em>might</em> sometimes choose a worse execution plan for an <code>INNER JOIN</code> than a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>.",2726657,1,"['sql', 'sql-server', 'performance']",INNER JOIN vs LEFT JOIN performance in SQL Server,"[{'sentence': 'A <code>LEFT JOIN</code> is absolutely not faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': ""In fact, it's slower; by definition, an outer join (<code>LEFT JOIN</code> or <code>RIGHT JOIN</code>)  has to do all the work of an <code>INNER JOIN</code> plus the extra work of null-extending the results."", 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'It would also be expected to return more rows, further increasing the total execution time simply due to the larger size of the result set.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': '(And even if a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> <em>were</em> faster in <em>specific</em> situations due to some difficult-to-imagine confluence of factors, it is not functionally equivalent to an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, so you cannot simply go replacing all instances of one with the other!)', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'Most likely your performance problems lie elsewhere, such as not having a candidate key or foreign key indexed properly.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '9 tables is quite a lot to be joining so the slowdown could literally be almost anywhere.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'If you post your schema, we might be able to provide more details.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '<strong>Edit:</strong>', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'Reflecting further on this, I could think of one circumstance under which a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> might be faster than an <code>INNER JOIN</code>, and that is when:', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': '<li>Some of the tables are <em>very</em> small (say, under 10 rows);', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': '<li>The tables do not have sufficient indexes to cover the query.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'Consider this example:', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'BIGBLOCK', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': ""If you run this and view the execution plan, you'll see that the <code>INNER JOIN</code> query does indeed cost more than the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>, because it satisfies the two criteria above."", 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': ""It's because SQL Server wants to do a hash match for the <code>INNER JOIN</code>, but does nested loops for the <code>LEFT JOIN</code>; the former is <em>normally</em> much faster, but since the number of rows is so tiny <em>and</em> there's no index to use, the hashing operation turns out to be the most expensive part of the query."", 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'You can see the same effect by writing a program in your favourite programming language to perform a large number of lookups on a list with 5 elements, vs. a hash table with 5 elements.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'Because of the size, the hash table version is actually slower.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': ""But increase it to 50 elements, or 5000 elements, and the list version slows to a crawl, because it's O(N) vs. O(1) for the hashtable."", 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': ""But change this query to be on the <code>ID</code> column instead of <code>Name</code> and you'll see a very different story."", 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'In that case, it does nested loops for both queries, but the <code>INNER JOIN</code> version is able to replace one of the clustered index scans with a seek - meaning that this will literally be <em>an order of magnitude</em> faster with a large number of rows.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'So the conclusion is more or less what I mentioned several paragraphs above; this is almost certainly an indexing or index coverage problem, possibly combined with one or more very small tables.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'Those are the only circumstances under which SQL Server <em>might</em> sometimes choose a worse execution plan for an <code>INNER JOIN</code> than a <code>LEFT JOIN</code>.', 'truth': 1}]"

3044340,"http://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html See part 6. HTTP Authentication HTTP Authentication HTTP Authentication is the ability to tell the server your username and    password so that it can verify that you're allowed to do the request you're    doing. The Basic authentication used in HTTP (which is the type curl uses by    default) is plain text based, which means it sends username and password    only slightly obfuscated, but still fully readable by anyone that sniffs on    the network between you and the remote server. To tell curl to use a user and password for authentication: The site might require a different authentication method (check the headers    returned by the server), and then --ntlm, --digest, --negotiate or even    --anyauth might be options that suit you. Sometimes your HTTP access is only available through the use of a HTTP    proxy. This seems to be especially common at various companies. A HTTP proxy    may require its own user and password to allow the client to get through to    the Internet. To specify those with curl, run something like: If your proxy requires the authentication to be done using the NTLM method,    use --proxy-ntlm, if it requires Digest use --proxy-digest. If you use any one these user+password options but leave out the password    part, curl will prompt for the password interactively. Do note that when a program is run, its parameters might be possible to see    when listing the running processes of the system. Thus, other users may be    able to watch your passwords if you pass them as plain command line    options. There are ways to circumvent this. It is worth noting that while this is how HTTP Authentication works, very    many web sites will not use this concept when they provide logins etc. See    the Web Login chapter further below for more details on that.",3044315,2,"['curl', 'oauth']",How to set the authorization header using curl,"[{'sentence': 'http://curl.haxx.se/docs/httpscripting.html', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'See part 6.', 'truth': 1}, {'sentence': 'HTTP Authentication', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'HTTP Authentication', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'HTTP Authentication is the ability to tell the server your username and', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': ""   password so that it can verify that you're allowed to do the request you're"", 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   doing.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'The Basic authentication used in HTTP (which is the type curl uses by', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   default) is plain text based, which means it sends username and password', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   only slightly obfuscated, but still fully readable by anyone that sniffs on', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   the network between you and the remote server.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'To tell curl to use a user and password for authentication:', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'The site might require a different authentication method (check the headers', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   returned by the server), and then --ntlm, --digest, --negotiate or even', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   --anyauth might be options that suit you.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'Sometimes your HTTP access is only available through the use of a HTTP', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   proxy.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'This seems to be especially common at various companies.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'A HTTP proxy', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   may require its own user and password to allow the client to get through to', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   the Internet.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'To specify those with curl, run something like:', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'If your proxy requires the authentication to be done using the NTLM method,', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   use --proxy-ntlm, if it requires Digest use --proxy-digest.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'If you use any one these user+password options but leave out the password', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   part, curl will prompt for the password interactively.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'Do note that when a program is run, its parameters might be possible to see', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   when listing the running processes of the system.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'Thus, other users may be', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   able to watch your passwords if you pass them as plain command line', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   options.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'There are ways to circumvent this.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'It is worth noting that while this is how HTTP Authentication works, very', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   many web sites will not use this concept when they provide logins etc.', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': 'See', 'truth': 0}, {'sentence': '   the Web Login chapter further below for more details on that.', 'truth': 0}]"

3477374,"<code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> are two different types of HTTP requests. According to Wikipedia: GET requests a representation of the specified resource. Note that GET should not be used for operations that cause side-effects, such as using it for taking actions in web applications. One reason for this is that GET may be used arbitrarily by robots or crawlers, which should not need to consider the side effects that a request should cause. and POST submits data to be processed (e.g., from an HTML form) to the identified resource. The data is included in the body of the request. This may result in the creation of a new resource or the updates of existing resources or both. So essentially <code>GET</code> is used to retrieve remote data, and <code>POST</code> is used to insert/update remote data. HTTP/1.1 specification (RFC 2616) section 9 Method Definitions contains more information on <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> as well as the other HTTP methods, if you are interested. In addition to explaining the intended uses of each method, the spec also provides at least one practical reason for why <code>GET</code> should only be used to retrieve data: Authors of services which use the HTTP protocol SHOULD NOT use GET based forms for the submission of sensitive data, because this will cause this data to be encoded in the Request-URI. Many existing servers, proxies, and user agents will log the request URI in some place where it might be visible to third parties. Servers can use POST-based form submission instead Finally, an important consideration when using <code>GET</code> for AJAX requests is that some browsers - IE in particular - will cache the results of a <code>GET</code> request. So if you, for example, poll using the same <code>GET</code> request you will always get back the same results, even if the data you are querying is being updated server-side.

3642969,"Introduction The <code>ViewExpiredException</code> will be thrown whenever the <code>javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD</code> is set to <code>server</code> (default) and the enduser sends a HTTP POST request on a view via <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;h:commandLink&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h:commandButton&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;f:ajax&gt;</code>, while the associated view state isn't available in the session anymore. The view state is identified as value of a hidden input field <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> of the <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code>. With the state saving method set to <code>server</code>, this contains only the view state ID which references a serialized view state in the session. So, when the session is expired for some reason (either timed out in server or client side, or the session cookie is not maintained anymore for some reason in browser, or by calling <code>HttpSession#invalidate()</code> in server, or due a server specific bug with session cookies as known in WildFly), then the serialized view state is not available anymore in the session and the enduser will get this exception. To understand the working of the session, see also How do servlets work? Instantiation, sessions, shared variables and multithreading. There is also a limit on the amount of views JSF will store in the session. When the limit is hit, then the least recently used view will be expired. See also com.sun.faces.numberOfViewsInSession vs com.sun.faces.numberOfLogicalViews. With the state saving method set to <code>client</code>, the <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden input field contains instead the whole serialized view state, so the enduser won't get a <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when the session expires. It can however still happen on a cluster environment (""ERROR: MAC did not verify"" is symptomatic) and/or when there's a implementation-specific timeout on the client side state configured and/or when server re-generates the AES key during restart, see also Getting ViewExpiredException in clustered environment while state saving method is set to client and user session is valid how to solve it. Regardless of the solution, make sure you do not use <code>enableRestoreView11Compatibility</code>. it does not at all restore the original view state. It basically recreates the view and all associated view scoped beans from scratch and hereby thus losing all of original data (state). As the application will behave in a confusing way (""Hey, where are my input values..?? ""), this is very bad for user experience. Better use stateless views or <code>&lt;o:enableRestorableView&gt;</code> instead so you can manage it on a specific view only instead of on all views. As to the why JSF needs to save view state, head to this answer: Why JSF saves the state of UI components on server? Avoiding ViewExpiredException on page navigation In order to avoid <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when e.g. navigating back after logout when the state saving is set to <code>server</code>, only redirecting the POST request after logout is not sufficient. You also need to instruct the browser to not cache the dynamic JSF pages, otherwise the browser may show them from the cache instead of requesting a fresh one from the server when you send a GET request on it (e.g. by back button). The <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden field of the cached page may contain a view state ID value which is not valid anymore in the current session. If you're (ab)using POST (command links/buttons) instead of GET (regular links/buttons) for page-to-page navigation, and click such a command link/button on the cached page, then this will in turn fail with a <code>ViewExpiredException</code>. To fire a redirect after logout in JSF 2.0, either add <code>&lt;redirect /&gt;</code> to the <code>&lt;navigation-case&gt;</code> in question (if any), or add <code>?faces-redirect=true</code> to the <code>outcome</code> value. or To instruct the browser to not cache the dynamic JSF pages, create a <code>Filter</code> which is mapped on the servlet name of the <code>FacesServlet</code> and adds the needed response headers to disable the browser cache. E.g. Avoiding ViewExpiredException on page refresh In order to avoid <code>ViewExpiredException</code> when refreshing the current page when the state saving is set to <code>server</code>, you not only need to make sure you are performing page-to-page navigation exclusively by GET (regular links/buttons), but you also need to make sure that you are exclusively using ajax to submit the forms. If you're submitting the form synchronously (non-ajax) anyway, then you'd best either make the view stateless (see later section), or to send a redirect after POST (see previous section). Having a <code>ViewExpiredException</code> on page refresh is in default configuration a very rare case. It can only happen when the limit on the amount of views JSF will store in the session is hit. So, it will only happen when you've manually set that limit way too low, or that you're continuously creating new views in background (e.g. by a badly implemented poll). See also com.sun.faces.numberOfViewsInSession vs com.sun.faces.numberOfLogicalViews. Another cause is having duplicate JSF libraries in runtime classpath conflicting each other. The correct procedure to install JSF is outlined in our JSF wiki page. Handling ViewExpiredException When you want to handle an unavoidable <code>ViewExpiredException</code> after a POST action on an arbitrary page which was already opened in some browser tab/window while you're logged out in another tab/window, then you'd like to specify an <code>error-page</code> for that in <code>web.xml</code> which goes to a ""Your session is timed out"" page. E.g. Use if necessary a meta refresh header in the error page in case you intend to actually redirect further to home or login page. (the <code>0</code> in <code>content</code> represents the amount of seconds before redirect, <code>0</code> thus means ""redirect immediately"", you can use e.g. <code>3</code> to let the browser wait 3 seconds with the redirect) Note that handling exceptions during ajax requests requires a special <code>ExceptionHandler</code>. See also Session timeout and ViewExpiredException handling on JSF/PrimeFaces ajax request. You can find a live example at OmniFaces <code>FullAjaxExceptionHandler</code> showcase page (this also covers non-ajax requests). Also note that your ""general"" error page should be mapped on <code>&lt;error-code&gt;</code> of <code>500</code> instead of an <code>&lt;exception-type&gt;</code> of e.g. <code>java.lang.Exception</code> or <code>java.lang.Throwable</code>, otherwise all exceptions wrapped in <code>ServletException</code> such as <code>ViewExpiredException</code> would still end up in the general error page. See also ViewExpiredException shown in java.lang.Throwable error-page in web.xml. Stateless views A completely different alternative is to run JSF views in stateless mode. This way nothing of JSF state will be saved and the views will never expire, but just be rebuilt from scratch on every request. You can turn on stateless views by setting the <code>transient</code> attribute of <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> to <code>true</code>: This way the <code>javax.faces.ViewState</code> hidden field will get a fixed value of <code>""stateless""</code> in Mojarra (have not checked MyFaces at this point). Note that this feature was introduced in Mojarra 2.1.19 and 2.2.0 and is not available in older versions. The consequence is that you cannot use view scoped beans anymore. They will now behave like request scoped beans. One of the disadvantages is that you have to track the state yourself by fiddling with hidden inputs and/or loose request parameters. Mainly those forms with input fields with <code>rendered</code>, <code>readonly</code> or <code>disabled</code> attributes which are controlled by ajax events will be affected. Note that the <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> does not necessarily need to be unique throughout the view and/or reside in the master template only. It's also completely legit to redeclare and nest it in a template client. It basically ""extends"" the parent <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> then. E.g. in master template: and in template client: You can even wrap the <code>&lt;f:view&gt;</code> in a <code>&lt;c:if&gt;</code> to make it conditional. Note that it would apply on the entire view, not only on the nested contents, such as the <code>&lt;h:form&gt;</code> in above example. See also ViewExpiredException shown in java.lang.Throwable error-page in web.xml Check if session exists JSF Session timeout and ViewExpiredException handling on JSF/PrimeFaces ajax request Unrelated to the concrete problem, using HTTP POST for pure page-to-page navigation isn't very user/SEO friendly. In JSF 2.0 you should really prefer <code>&lt;h:link&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;h:button&gt;</code> over the <code>&lt;h:commandXxx&gt;</code> ones for plain vanilla page-to-page navigation.

417184,"<h2>Short answer - de facto limit of 2000 characters</h2>
<p>If you keep URLs under 2000 characters, they'll work in virtually any combination of client and server software, and any search engine.</p>
<p>For specific use cases, longer URLs can be considered. Outside of search engines, 8000 characters offers wide compatibility as of 2023. Read on for all the details...</p>
<h2>Longer answer - first, the standards...</h2>
<p>The original HTTP/1.1 specification, published in 1999, <a href=""http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2616.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 2616</a>, said in section 3.2.1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The HTTP protocol does not place
any a priori limit on the length of
a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle
the URI of any resource they    serve,
and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of
unbounded length if they    provide
GET-based forms that could generate
such URIs. A server    SHOULD return
414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a
URI is longer    than the server can
handle (see section 10.4.15).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2014, this was obsoleted by an updated specification largely to match actual usage, <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7230#section-3.1.1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 7230</a>; it suggests:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Various ad hoc limitations on request-line length are found in
practice. It is RECOMMENDED that all HTTP senders and recipients
support, at a minimum, request-line lengths of 8000 octets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2022, a new update was published, defining HTTP semantics independently of HTTP version (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3). <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-4.1-5"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">RFC 9110, section 4.1</a>, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is RECOMMENDED that all senders and recipients support, at a minimum, URIs with lengths of 8000 octets in protocol elements. Note that this implies some structures and on-wire representations (for example, the request line in HTTP/1.1) will necessarily be larger in some cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>...and the reality</h2>
<p>That's what the <em>standards</em> say. For the <em>reality</em>, there was an article on <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20190902193246/https://boutell.com/newfaq/misc/urllength.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">boutell.com</a> (link goes to Internet Archive backup) that discussed what individual browser and server implementations will support. The executive summary is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extremely long URLs are usually a
mistake. <strong>URLs over 2,000 characters
will not work in the most popular web
browsers.</strong> Don't use them if you intend
your site to work for the majority of
Internet users.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note: this is a quote from an article written in <em>2006</em>, but in 2015 IE's declining usage means that longer URLs <em>do</em> work for the majority. However, IE still has the limitation...)</p>
<h2>Internet Explorer's limitations...</h2>
<p><a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/208427"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IE8's maximum URL length is 2083 chars</a>, and it seems <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3721034/how-long-an-url-can-internet-explorer-9-take"">IE9 has a similar limit</a>.</p>
<p>I've tested IE10 and the address bar will only accept 2083 chars. You can <em>click</em> a URL which is longer than this, but the address bar will still only show 2083 characters of this link.</p>
<p>There's a <a href=""https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ieinternals/2014/08/13/url-length-limits/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">nice writeup on the IE Internals blog</a> which goes into some of the background to this.</p>
<p>There are mixed reports IE11 supports longer URLs - see comments below. Given some people report issues, the general advice still stands.</p>
<h2>Search engines like URLs &lt; 2048 chars...</h2>
<p>Be aware that the <a href=""http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sitemaps protocol</a>, which allows a site to inform search engines about available pages, has a limit of 2048 characters in a URL. If you intend to use sitemaps, a limit has been decided for you! (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/7056886/6521"">Calin-Andrei Burloiu's answer</a> below)</p>
<p>There's also some research from 2010 into the <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20111110004006/http://www.seomofo.com/experiments/title-and-h1-of-this-post-but-for-the-sake-of-keyword-prominence-stuffing-im-going-to-mention-it-again-using-various-synonyms-stemmed-variations-and-of-coursea-big-fat-prominent-font-size-heres-the-stumper-that-stumped-me-what-is-the-max-number-of-chars-in-a-url-that-google-is-willing-to-crawl-and-index-for-whatever-reason-i-thought-i-had-read-somewhere-that-googles-limit-on-urls-was-255-characters-but-that-turned-out-to-be-wrong-so-maybe-i-just-made-that-number-up-the-best-answer-i-could-find-was-this-quote-from-googles-webmaster-trends-analyst-john-mueller-we-can-certainly-crawl-and-index-urls-over-1000-characters-long-but-that-doesnt-mean-that-its-a-good-practice-the-setup-for-this-experiment-is-going-to-be-pretty-simple-im-going-to-edit-the-permalink-of-this-post-to-be-really-really-long-then-im-going-to-see-if-google-indexes-it-i-might-even-see-if-yahoo-and-bing-index-iteven-though-no-one-really-cares-what-those-assholes-are-doing-url-character-limits-unrelated-to-google-the-question-now-is-how-many-characters-should-i-make-the-url-of-this-post-there-are-a-couple-of-sources-ill-reference-to-help-me-make-this-decision-the-first-is-this-quote-from-the-microsoft-support-pages-microsoft-internet-explorer-has-a-maximum-uniform-resource-locator-url-length-of-2083-characters-internet-explorer-also-has-a-maximum-path-length-of-2048-characters-this-limit-applies-to-both-post-request-and-get-request-urls-the-second-source-ill-cite-is-the-http-11-protocol-which-says-the-http-protocol-does-not-place-any-a-priori-limit-on-the-length-of-a-uri-servers-must-be-able-to-handle-the-uri-of-any-resource-they-serve-and-should-be-able-to-handle-uris-of-unbounded-length-if-they-provide-get-based-forms-that-could-generate-such-uris-a-server-should-return-414-request-uri-too-long-status-if-a-uri-is-longer.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">maximum URL length that search engines will crawl and index</a>.

However, they also found the Google <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_results_page"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SERP</a> tool wouldn't cope with URLs longer than 1855 chars.</p>
<h2>CDNs have limits</h2>

<h2>Original answer</h2>
<p>This article about Javascript Strict Mode might interest you: <a href=""https://johnresig.com/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/"" rel=""noreferrer"">John Resig - ECMAScript 5 Strict Mode, JSON, and More</a></p>
<p>To quote some interesting parts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strict Mode is a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or a function, in a &quot;strict&quot; operating context. This strict context prevents certain actions from being taken and throws more exceptions.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strict mode helps out in a couple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It catches some common coding bloopers, throwing exceptions.</li>
<li>It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively &quot;unsafe&quot; actions are taken (such as gaining access to the global object).</li>
<li>It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Also note you can apply &quot;strict mode&quot; to the whole file... Or you can use it only for a specific function <em>(still quoting from John Resig's article)</em>:</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>// Non-strict code...

(function(){
  &quot;use strict&quot;;

  // Define your library strictly...
})();

// Non-strict code...
</code></pre>
<p>Which might be helpful if you have to mix old and new code ;-)</p>
<p>So, I suppose it's a bit like the <a href=""https://perldoc.perl.org/strict"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>&quot;use strict&quot;</code></a> you can use in Perl <em>(hence the name?)</em>: it helps you make fewer errors, by detecting more things that could lead to breakages.</p>

<p>compile the above with </p>

<pre><code>csc.exe /target:exe /out:Bob.exe Bob.cs
</code></pre>

<p>I use the slowAES.wsc from the other post you referenced, with 2 changes: I do not call getPaddedBlock() for the key in the EncryptString or DecryptString() methods. This really needs a PBKDF but let's not worry about that now. Here's what the modified EncryptString looks like: </p>

<pre><code>function EncryptString(plainText)
{
  // this is really wrong - need a PBBKDF to get the key, instead
  // of just using the passphrase
  var key = cryptoHelpers.convertStringToByteArray(_passphrase);
  // var nkey = slowAES.getPaddedBlock(key, 0, _keysize, _mode);
  var bytesToEncrypt = cryptoHelpers.convertStringToByteArray(plainText);

  var result = slowAES.encrypt(bytesToEncrypt, 
      _mode,
      key,
      _keysize,
      _iv);
  return result['cipher'];
}
</code></pre>

<p>This means you have to use a passPhrase that is <em>exactly</em> the length required by the keysize.  If you use AES256, then pass a 32-char string (32 * 8 = 256 bits).  Seems like you figured this out already. </p>

<p>The client of the WSC component is also Javascript (though it can be any COM language).  Here's what I used.</p>

<pre><code>function toHexString(a)
{
    var ret = '';
    for(var i = 0;i &lt; a.length;i++)
        ret += (a[i] &lt; 16 ? '0' : '') + a[i].toString(16) + ' ';
    return ret.toLowerCase();
}


//var plaintext = ""Hello. This is a test. of the emergency broadcasting system."";
var plaintext = ""watson?"";

try
{
    WScript.echo( ""plaintext: "" + plaintext);
    WScript.echo( ""plaintext.length: "" + plaintext.length);

    WScript.echo( ""instantiate "");
    var aes = new ActiveXObject(""Ionic.Com.SlowAES"");

    WScript.echo( ""keysize "");
    aes.KeySize = 256;

    WScript.echo( ""passphrase "");
    aes.PassPhrase= ""12345678901234567890123456789012"";  // 32 chars long

    WScript.echo( ""mode "");
    aes.Mode = ""CBC"";

    WScript.echo( ""encrypting... "");
    var result = aes.EncryptString(plaintext);

    WScript.echo( ""Cryptotext: "" + toHexString(result));

    WScript.echo( ""decrypting... "");
    var decrypted = aes.DecryptBytesToString(result);

    WScript.echo( ""decrypted: "" + decrypted);
}
catch(e)
{
    WScript.echo(""Exception: "" + e); 
    //     WScript.echo(e.Number + "": "" + e.Name);
    WScript.echo(e.Message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>If I then run this code, the Javascript and C# produces the same cipher text for a plaintext of ""watson?"", using AES256, passphrase of 12345678901234567890123456789012, and an IV of 16 bytes of zero.  The ciphertext generated is: </p>

<pre><code>8B 68 A6 23 08 2A D8 A0 EB 99 17 8F 69 03 18 FF
</code></pre>

<p>It successfully decrypts in both cases. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Though I packaged the slowAES encryption in a WSC, it will be interoperable running outside the COM environment as well. The WSC part is unnecessary for this question, but was necessary to demonstrate the answer for a prior question, which  was, ""<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/270510/how-to-encrypt-in-vbscript-using-aes"">how can I get VBScript and .NET AES to interoperate?</a>""</p>

<p><strong>EDIT2</strong>:  The source code that demonstrates AES interop between Javascript or VBScript and .NET <a href=""https://github.com/DinoChiesa/AES-Interop-Example"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">is available</a>.  I extended the basic example given here to produce test apps in 3 languages: C#, Javascript and VBScript.  They all take the same set of arguments.  They each use a RFC2898-compliant key derivation function.  You can specify the password, salt, IV, and plaintext, as well as the number of RFC2898 iterations to use in the PBKDF2.  You can easily verify that the ciphertext is the same for each of these test programs. Maybe the example will be useful for someone. </p>

228116,"<p>There are three messaging patterns mentioned here:</p>

<ol>
<li>Synchronous request-response    </li>
<li>Asynchronous send (fire and forget with one-way service)</li>
<li>Asynchronous request-response (duplex service call with one-way service)</li>
</ol>

<p>All three display different messaging behaviour, and the pattern to be used should be chosen based on your needs. </p>

<p>For your requirement of returning a success to the client when the data has been persisted to the database, options 1 or 3 are appropriate.</p>

<h3>Option 1</h3>

<p>This is the default configuration.</p>

<p>This returns a 200 response on the same http connection once the service has completed all its tasks. This means that calls to the service will block while waiting for the response - your client will hang until the service has written to the database and done anything else it needs.</p>

<h3>Option 2</h3>

<p>Returns a 202 response so long as the transport layer and messaging infrastructure layer succeeds. The 202 returned indicates that the message has been accepted. From the <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http rfc</a>: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. (...) The 202 response is intentionally non-committal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means that your client will continue execution as soon as the service infrastructure has successfully started the service, and you will receive no information about whether the database call succeeds or not.</p>

<h3>Option 3</h3>

<p>Similar to option 2, the response is an http 202, not a 200, but now when you call the service from the client you provide an <code>InstanceContext</code> object that specifies an object to handle the call back. The client regains control and a new thread waits asynchronously for the service response informing you of success or failure. </p>

<hr>

<p>Below is some more info about implementing these patterns in WCF. After writing it, it is pretty long but there are a couple of useful comments as well as the code.</p>

<p>As Whisk mentioned, Juval Lowy has an article covering a lot this detail (and more!) <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163537.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></p>

<h3>Option 1</h3>

<p>This is the default behaviour in WCF so you should not need to do anything - it works with lots of different bindings including wsHttpBinding and basicHttpBinding.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that the behaviour described with your client hanging waiting for the 200 response occurrs even if you have a void Operation like so:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
interface IMyServiceContract
{
    [OperationContract]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Option 2</h3>

<p>To set an operation as one-way you simply decorate it as so:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract]
interface IMyServiceContract
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Methods decorated in this way must only have a return type of void. One gotcha is that the service will happily build and you won't get an exception saying the service config is invalid until you connect to it.</p>

<h3>Option 3</h3>

<p>The interface code for creating a duplex callback service is:</p>

<pre><code>[ServiceContract(CallbackContract = typeof(IMyContractCallback))]
interface IMyContract
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay=true)]       
    void DoSomeThing(InputMessage Message);
}

public interface IMyContractCallback
{
    [OperationContract(IsOneWay = true)]
    void ServiceResponse(string result);      
}
</code></pre>

<p>And on the client side you need something like so to set up the callback:</p>

<pre><code>public class CallbackHandler : IMyContractCallback        
{
    #region IEchoContractCallback Members

    public void ServiceResponse(string result)
    {
        //Do something with the response
    }

    #endregion
}

// And in the client when you set up the service call:

InstanceContext instanceContext = new InstanceContext(new CallbackHandler());
MyContractClient client = new MyContractClient(instanceContext);

InputMessage msg = new InputMessage();

client.DoSomething(msg);           
</code></pre>

<p>In the service you would perhaps have some code like:</p>

<pre><code>class MyContractImplementation : IMyContract
{
    public void DoSomeThing(MyMessage Message)
    {

        string responseMessage;

        try
        {
           //Write to the database
           responseMessage = ""The database call was good!"";
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            responseMessage = ex.Message;
        }

        Callback.ServiceResponse(responseMessage);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>One important thing to note, that caught me out at first, is to be careful about exceptions. If you: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Consume an exception, you will get no warning of the error (but the callback will happen)</p></li>
<li><p>Throw an unhandled exception, the service will terminate and the client will not even get the callback.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That is one big disadvantage of this method compared with Option 1, Option 1 will return the exception when an unhandled exception is thrown.</p>

56713123,"<h3>The low-hanging fruit</h3>

<pre><code>numpy.savez_compressed('AlaskaCoast.npz', arr)
arr = numpy.load('AlaskaCoast.npz')['arr_0']
</code></pre>

<p>Loading is 2.3x faster than your PIL-based code.</p>

<p>It uses <code>zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED</code>, see <a href=""https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.savez_compressed.html#numpy.savez_compressed"" rel=""noreferrer"">savez_compressed</a> docu.</p>

<p>Your PIL code also has an unneeded copy: <code>array(img)</code> should be <code>asarray(img)</code>. It only costs 5% of the slow loading time. But after optimization this will be significant and you have to keep in mind which numpy operators create a copy.</p>

<h3>Fast decompression</h3>

<p>According to the <a href=""https://facebook.github.io/zstd/"" rel=""noreferrer"">zstd benchmarks</a>, when optimizing for decompression <a href=""https://python-lz4.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">lz4</a> is a good choice. Just plugging this into pickle gives another 2.4x gain and is only 30% slower than uncompressed pickling.</p>

<pre><code>import pickle
import lz4.frame

# with lz4.frame.open('AlaskaCoast.lz4', 'wb') as f:
#     pickle.dump(arr, f)

with lz4.frame.open('AlaskaCoast.lz4', 'rb') as f:
    arr = pickle.load(f)
</code></pre>

<h3>Benchmarks</h3>

<pre><code>method                 size   load time
------                 ----   ---------
original (PNG+PIL)     5.1M   7.1
np.load (compressed)   6.7M   3.1
pickle + lz4           7.1M   1.3
pickle (uncompressed)  601M   1.0 (baseline)
</code></pre>

<p>The load time was measured inside Python (3.7.3), using the minimum wall-clock time over 20 runs on my desktop. According to occasional glances at <code>top</code> it always seemed to be running on a single core.</p>

<h3>For the curious: profiling</h3>

<p>I'm not sure if the Python version matters, most work is supposed to happen inside of C libraries. To validate this I've profiled the <code>pickle + lz4</code> variant:</p>

<pre><code>perf record ./test.py &amp;&amp; perf report -s dso
Overhead  Shared Object
  60.16%  [kernel.kallsyms]  # mostly page_fault and alloc_pages_vma
  27.53%  libc-2.28.so       # mainly memmove
   9.75%  liblz4.so.1.8.3    # only LZ4_decompress_*
   2.33%  python3.7
   ...
</code></pre>

<p>Most time is spent inside of the Linux kernel, doing <code>page_fault</code> and stuff associated with (re-)allocating memory, probably including disk I/O. The high amount of <code>memmove</code> looks suspicious. Probably Python is re-allocating (resizing) the final array every time a new decompressed chunk arrives.

39900332,"<p>The short answer is, <strong>you will probably need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</strong>.  But given the number and range of partially answered and unanswered questions here* and elsewhere on using <a href=""https://www.jetbrains.com/clion"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JetBrains' CLion IDE</a> with <a href=""http://opencv.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the OpenCV library</a>, I think an overview is needed (my notes are from CLion 2016.3 and OpenCV 3.1, YMMV):</p>

<ul>
<li>Though not produced by JetBrains, <a href=""https://cmake.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CMake</a> is very central to CLion's operation.  Understanding CMake therefore helps greatly in diagnosing CLion build problems.  In particular CMake maintains a disk ""cache"" of settings which you may need to clear to incorporate changes to your environment (<em>Tools->CMake->Reset Cache and Reload Project</em>).</li>
<li><p>To make use of <em>OpenCV</em> in your build you must specify it in your project's <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> file.  You request that CMake locate your OpenCV location and link it to your <code>TARGET</code>.  An example of a sequence of commands from <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> for an executable named <code>mushroom</code> follows:
<code>
add_executable(mushroom ${SOURCE_FILES})
FIND_PACKAGE(OpenCV REQUIRED)
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(mushroom ${OpenCV_LIBS})</code></p>

<p>(For more on <code>FIND_PACKAGE</code>, see <a href=""https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:How_To_Find_Libraries"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CMake:How To Find Libraries</a>.)</p></li>
<li><p><code>FIND_PACKAGE</code> for package <em>XXX</em> works either by way of <em>FindXXX.cmake</em> files located at CMake's <code>Modules</code> directory, or by consulting environment variable <em>XXXX_DIR</em>.  On my system, no <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> file was present, so I relied on the <em>OpenCV_DIR</em> environment variable instead.  This must be set, not to the root of your OpenCV installation, but to the <em>build</em> folder beneath it.  I used an entry in <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> to set this variable, e.g.:</p>

<pre>set(OpenCV_DIR C:/Users/myacct/AppData/Local/opencv-3.0.0/build)</pre></li>
<li><p>To link with OpenCV, CMake uses either <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> or <em>OpenCV_DIR</em> (see previous point above) to locate a file named <em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em>.  This file is generated by and ships with a particular build of OpenCV in order to document what components are present and where they are located.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><em>Problems may occur when variable names used by OpenCVConfig.cmake conflict with those CLion has stored in its environment</em></strong>. In particular, if your OpenCV was built by Microsoft Visual C (<em>MSVC</em>), as is <a href=""https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Windows distribution from opencv.org</a>, it won't work with CLion.    </p>

<p>Because CLion's build toolchain (<kbd>Control</kbd><kbd>Alt</kbd><kbd>S</kbd>-toolchain) uses either MinGW or Cygwin, <em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em> will search for OpenCV binaries under a subdirectory named <em>mingw</em> or <em>cygwin</em> <strong><em>and will find none</em></strong> because the binaries were built with MSVC (it will look in a directory like <em>vc11</em> or <em>vc12</em> instead).  This probably means <strong><em>you will need to build OpenCV from source in order to use it with CLion</em></strong>.</p>

<p><em>Would reconfiguring OpenCVConfig.cmake to point to the MSVC binaries make this work?</em> you may ask.  Unfortunately the answer is still no, because <a href=""http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Interoperability_of_Libraries_Created_by_Different_Compiler_Brands"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">libraries built with one compiler typically cannot be linked with another one</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><em>OpenCVConfig.cmake</em> or <em>FindOpenCV.cmake</em> likely contain diagnostic messages, but when CLion executes CMake for you, <code>message(STATUS)</code> calls are not displayed.  To make them display, change them to <code>message(WARNING)</code> or <code>message(FATAL_ERROR)</code>.  <em>But CLion 2016.3 EAP relieves this problem; see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/39398373/5025060"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/39398373/5025060</a>.</em></p></li>
<li><p>CLion does not indicate which .cmake script issued which diagnostics; don't assume they all come from the same script.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully this provides some general guidance on resolving <em>CLion / CMake / OpenCV</em> compatibility problems.  Note that this does not cover <em>compiler</em> or <em>linker</em> issues; these will not appear until <em>CMake</em> completes its initial makefile build.  Compiler or linker issues occur at a later stage and are controlled by <code>include*()</code>, <code>link*()</code> and other commands in <em>CMakeLists.txt</em>.</p>

38111382,"<p>When an interval is <strong>a difference between two timestamps</strong> it is always justified to hours (i.e. it has <em>standard</em> format). Examples:</p>

<pre><code>select
    '2015-01-01 13:0:0'::timestamp - '2014-01-01 23:0:0'::timestamp, --&gt; 364 days 14:00:00

    '2015-01-01 13:0:0'::timestamp - '2015-01-01 03:0:0'::timestamp; --&gt; 10:00:00
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Calculations on intervals</strong> are executed on date part and time part separately, so they may lead to strange formats. Examples:</p>

<pre><code>select 
    '2 day 1:00:00'::interval- '1 day 2:00:00'::interval,    --&gt; 1 day -01:00:00 (!!)
    '2 day 100:00:00'::interval+ '1 day 60:00:00'::interval, --&gt; 3 days 160:00:00
    '2 day 100:00:00'::interval- '2 day 60:00:00'::interval; --&gt; 40:00:00
</code></pre>

<p>For such cases Postgres developers provided the appropriate function for the <em>format standardization</em>:</p>

<pre><code>select 
    justify_hours('1 day -01:00:00'),  --&gt; 23:00:00
    justify_hours('3 days 160:00:00'), --&gt; 9 days 16:00:00
    justify_hours('40:00:00');         --&gt; 1 day 16:00:00
</code></pre>

<p>However they did not think that the reverse operation would be needful. In <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/38082414/1995738"">this answer</a> I proposed a function to convert a date part of an interval to hours. I think it can be (with some minor changes) some kind of <em>reverse function</em> for <code>justify_hours()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>create or replace function unjustify_hours(interval)
returns interval language sql as $$
    select format('%s:%s',
        (extract (epoch from $1) / 3600)::int,
        to_char($1, 'mi:ss'))::interval;
$$;

select 
    unjustify_hours('23:00:00'),        --&gt; 23:00:00
    unjustify_hours('9 days 16:00:00'), --&gt; 232:00:00
    unjustify_hours('1 day 16:00:00');  --&gt; 40:00:00
</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>to_char(interval, text)</code> cannot be helpful here, as</p>

<pre><code>select 
    to_char(interval '23:00:00', 'hh24:mi:ss'),        --&gt; 23:00:00
    to_char(interval '9 days 16:00:00', 'hh24:mi:ss'), --&gt; 16:00:00 (!)
    to_char(interval '1 day 16:00:00',  'hh24:mi:ss'); --&gt; 16:00:00 (!)
</code></pre>

<p>Note that an interval can be correctly formatted in many ways:</p>

<pre><code>select 
    justify_hours('100:00:00'),        --&gt; 4 days 04:00:00
    justify_hours('1 days 76:00:00'),  --&gt; 4 days 04:00:00
    justify_hours('2 days 52:00:00'),  --&gt; 4 days 04:00:00
    justify_hours('5 days -20:00:00'); --&gt; 4 days 04:00:00
</code></pre>

<p>Per <a href=""https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/datatype-datetime.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">the documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to the SQL standard all fields of an interval value must
  have the same sign, so a leading negative sign applies to all fields;
  for example the negative sign in the interval literal '-1 2:03:04'
  applies to both the days and hour/minute/second parts. PostgreSQL
  allows the fields to have different signs, and traditionally treats
  each field in the textual representation as independently signed, so
  that the hour/minute/second part is considered positive in this
  example. If IntervalStyle is set to sql_standard then a leading sign
  is considered to apply to all fields (but only if no additional signs
  appear). Otherwise the traditional PostgreSQL interpretation is used.
  To avoid ambiguity, it's recommended to attach an explicit sign to
  each field if any field is negative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Internally interval values are stored as months, days, and seconds.
  This is done because the number of days in a month varies, and a day
  can have 23 or 25 hours if a daylight savings time adjustment is
  involved. The months and days fields are integers while the seconds
  field can store fractions. Because intervals are usually created from
  constant strings or timestamp subtraction, this storage method works
  well in most cases. Functions justify_days and justify_hours are
  available for adjusting days and hours that overflow their normal
  ranges.</p>

2058908,"<p>This is more of a syntax problem.  How do you divine the user's intent with just one input box?</p>

<ul>
<li>Are they looking for ""John Hamburg"" the person? </li>
<li>Are they looking for ""John Hamburg Street""?</li>
<li>Are they looking for ""John"" who lives on ""Hamburg Street"" in Springfield? </li>
<li>Are they looking for ""John"" who lives in the city of ""Hamburg""?</li>
</ul>

<p>Without knowing the user's intent, the best you can hope for is to OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you need to program in a ton of logic, depending on the number of words passed in:</p>

<p>2 words:</p>

<p>Search Employee data for term 1, Search Employee data for term 2, Search Address data for term 1, Search address data for term 2.  Merge results by term, order by most hits.</p>

<p>3 words:</p>

<p>Search Employee data for term 1, Search Employee data for term 2, Search employee data for term 3, Search Address data for term 1, Search address data for term 2, Search address data for term 3.  Merge results by term, order by most hits.</p>

<p>etc...</p>

<p>I guess I would redesign the GUI to separate the input into Name and Address, at a minimum.  If that is not possible, enforce a syntax rule to the effect ""First words will be considered a name until a comma appears, any words after that will be considered addresses""</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>Your best bet is still OR the terms, and take the highest ranking hits.  Here's an example of that, and an example why this is not ideal without some pre-processing of the input to divine the user's intent:</p>

<pre><code>insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (1, 'John Hamburg')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (2, 'John Smith')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (3, 'Bob Hamburg')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (4, 'Bob Smith')
insert into Employee (id, [name]) values (5, 'John Doe')

insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (1, 'Main St.', 'Springville', 1)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (2, 'Hamburg St.', 'Springville', 2)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (3, 'St. John Ave.', 'Springville', 3)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (4, '5th Ave.', 'Hamburg', 4)
insert into Address (id, street, city, employeeid) values (5, 'Oak Lane', 'Hamburg', 5)
</code></pre>

<p>Now since we don't know what keywords will apply to what table, we have to assume they could apply to either table, so we have to OR the terms against each table, UNION the results, Aggregate them, and compute the highest rank.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Id, [Name], Street, City, SUM([Rank])
FROM
(
    SELECT emp.Id, [Name], Street, City, [Rank]
    FROM Employee emp 
    JOIN [Address] addr ON emp.Id = addr.EmployeeId
    JOIN CONTAINSTABLE(Employee, *, 'JOHN OR Hamburg') AS keyTblEmp ON emp.Id = keyTblEmp.[KEY]

    UNION ALL

    SELECT emp.Id, [Name], Street, City, [Rank]
    FROM Employee emp 
    JOIN [Address] addr ON emp.Id = addr.EmployeeId
    JOIN CONTAINSTABLE([Address], *, 'JOHN OR Hamburg') AS keyTblAdd ON addr.Id = keyTblAdd.[KEY]   
) as tmp

GROUP BY Id, [Name], Street, City
ORDER BY SUM([Rank]) DESC
</code></pre>

<p>This is less than ideal, here's what you get for the example (in your case, you would have wanted John Doe from Hamburg to show up first):</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>Id       Name              Street            City           Rank
2        John Smith        Hamburg St.       Springville    112
3        Bob Hamburg       St. John Ave.     Springville    112
5        John Doe          Oak Lane          Hamburg        96
1        John Hamburg      Main St.          Springville    48
4        Bob Smith         5th Ave.          Hamburg        48

<p>Well, after a bit more testing, when installing MySQL, it seems <strong>you have to select ""Developpers Components > Scripts, examples""</strong>, which is not installed by default (at least on windows) -- no need to reinstall everything : you can ""modify"" the installation, to add this option.</p>

<p>Then, you will have a ""script"" directory next to the ""bin"" one.
For instance, on your install, it should be something like ""c:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.0\scripts"".</p>

<p>In this directory, there are some scripts ; one of them is <strong>mysqldumpslow.pl</strong> ; which is what you are looking for ;-)</p>

<p>Now, you ""just"" have to get Perl installed and running on your machine (sorry, I've never installed Perl on windows ; but you can find some informations <a href=""http://www.perl.com/download.csp#win32"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>)</p>

38318610,"<p>This is what I discovered. With the advent of concurrent-ruby, rake tasks aren't set up to handle this.</p>

<p>If you read in the documentation, it says with <code>:async</code>, it's cleared out of memory when the process ends. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rails itself only provides an in-process queuing system, which only
  keeps the jobs in RAM. If the process crashes or the machine is reset,
  then all outstanding jobs are lost with the default async back-end.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rake processes end when they're over. So, if you're doing any sort of data changes, rake tasks won't be open long enough to run a job, which is why they run <code>:inline</code> just fine, but not <code>:async</code>.</p>

<p>So, I haven't figured out a solution to keep rake tasks open long enough to run something <code>:async</code> (and keep the app <code>:async</code> the entire time). I have to switch it to <code>:inline</code> to run tasks, and then back to <code>:async</code> when I'm done for the rest of my jobs. It's why it works fine with <code>:sidekiq</code> or <code>:resque</code>, because those applications keep the job information in memory and do not release when the rake task is over.</p>

<p>In order for rake tasks to work with <code>:async</code> locally, there's not much you can do other than run tasks as <code>:inline</code> if you're local until rake (as a task runner) understands how to stay open while asynchronous tasks have been launched (or not). As a development only feature, this isn't really high priority, but, if you're bashing your head on the table not understanding why <code>:async</code> by default tasks that run jobs won't actually run, that's why.</p>

38316076,"<p>The problem is certainly <strong>not</strong> that <code>this</code> is a reserved word in JavaScript.
There is no rule in the <em>controller as</em> syntax that says you would need to assign the value of <code>this</code> to a variable with the same name as the controller and I'm pertty sure angular won't do such thing either. Why would it? That would be incredibly stupid use of <code>Function</code> constructor and just a needless bug.</p>

<p>There's a simple way to test that JavaScript reserved words are not the issue here. Name your controller ""throw"". <code>""Parent as throw""</code>. <code>throw</code> is a reserved word, but does that <em>throw</em> errors? No. Does that work? Yes.</p>

<p><code>this</code> is, however, reserved in the context of angular's own template expressions. It's used to refer to the current <code>scope</code> of the expression.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div ng-controller=""Parent as this""&gt;

    this.test = 'foo';
    $scope.log = function(arg){
        console.log(arg);
    };
});
</code></pre>

<p>In fact, it will also contain something intresting to us: property <code>this: Object</code>, our controller. </p>

<p>And sure enough, change the template expression to <code>{{log(this.this)}}</code> and it will log the controller instance just fine. Still wouldn't use <code>'this'</code> as the name though, it would probably just cause more bugs by mistake than undefined functions ever have.</p>

1818235,"<p>I believe the benefits of isolating your concerns into separate apps outweigh the costs. I would probably start off with just 2 apps (one for the main site and superadmin, one for the client sites and admins), accessing the same database, but you could do 4.</p>

<p>The downside is you don't really have isolation since all your apps are tied to one database. You will eventually run into scaling problems with your database, but starting off simple with one database will get you launched. One strategy for scaling later would be to add a slave db that the client site and main site apps use, while the admin apps use the master db. This along with a TON of caching will get you pretty far.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with having multiple rails apps access one db, however you will need a way to share common code across your apps. Your models for the most part. I've done this before by tossing all my models in a plugin that I share as a sub-module in git or as an external in svn. Having separate apps will make each app smaller and easier to maintain.</p>

<p>However, where do you keep your migrations? Where do you test your models? I would opt for the superadmin app. Also, you make a change to a model or the schema, and now you have to check 2-4 apps and make sure they still work!</p>

<p>Better isolation, separate db's and inter-app communication through web APIs (SOA) and you don't have to worry about that. SOA I think is the way to go after a certain point, but SOA might be premature when you first start out.</p>

First, following this thread <a href=""https://github.com/PySide/PySide/issues/138"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a></p>

<p>This gave the option of using PySide 1.2.2 or building 1.2.4 from scratch.
I settled for 1.2.2:</p>

<pre><code>pip install -U PySide==1.2.2

<p>In a nutshell: I checked the libraries for relative links like this:</p>

<p><code>otool -L /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/PySide/QtCore.so</code></p>

<p>Then I used <code>install_name_tool -change ...</code> as outlined in above link to re-link the two relative libraries in there to ""/usr/local/..."". E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>sudo install_name_tool -change libshiboken-python2.7.1.2.dylib /usr/local/lib/libshiboken-python2.7.1.2.dylib QtCore.so
sudo install_name_tool -change libpyside-python2.7.1.2.dylib /usr/local/lib/libpyside-python2.7.1.2.dylib QtCore.so

37774426,"<p>First, to explain the error message: you can't use <code>filter</code> in your definition, since</p>

<pre><code> filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]
</code></pre>

<p>has to do with regular Prelude lists, not your <code>List</code>s -- i.e. <code>[a]</code> not <code>List a</code>. The error message arises because <code>filter</code> expects <code>a</code> in </p>

<pre><code> map f a = filter (\listElement -&gt; listElement /= Nil) a
</code></pre>

<p>to be a list of something, but the signature you supplied declares that <code>a</code> is a <code>List</code> of something. Similarly <code>filter</code> returns a Prelude list of something, but the signature requires that it return a <code>List</code> of something. </p>

<p>The natural implementation of <code>map</code> for <code>List</code> would distinguish the cases of <code>List</code> that you gave in the type declaration, that is, it would ""pattern match"":</p>

<pre><code>mapList ::
    (a -&gt; b)
    -&gt; List a
    -&gt; List b
mapList f Nil = Nil
mapList f (t :. ls) = f t :. mapList f ls
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the program you wrote is perfectly valid, it just conflicts with the signature you gave it:</p>

<pre><code>ghci&gt; let mapX f a = filter (\listElement -&gt; listElement /= Nil) a
ghci&gt; :t mapX
mapX :: Eq a =&gt; t -&gt; [List a] -&gt; [List a]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>Eq</code> constraint is required because you presuppose that <code>List</code>s be tested for equality and thus that their elements can be.  <code>f</code> is not used, so it just ends up as a 'could be anything' parameter, here <code>t</code>. </p>

<p>Of course, if you have your own <code>filterList</code> for <code>List</code>s it will also typecheck</p>

<pre><code>ghci&gt; let filterList pred Nil = Nil; filterList pred (a :. as) = if pred a then a :. filterList pred as else filterList pred as

ghci&gt; :t filterList
filterList :: (t -&gt; Bool) -&gt; List t -&gt; List t

ghci&gt; let mapY f a = filterList (\listElement -&gt; listElement /= Nil) a

ghci&gt; :t mapY
mapY :: Eq a =&gt; t -&gt; List (List a) -&gt; List (List a)
</code></pre>

<p>What this function does is delete null elements from a List of Lists, like <code>Prelude.filter (not . Prelude.null)</code>. Similarly, the actual function you defined (without the signature) deleted <code>Nil</code> Lists from a <em>Prelude list</em> of your Lists.</p>

21862895,"<p>I know it sounds kind of backwards but you probably will want to use the <strong>Text File Input</strong> step to parse your CSV file, rather than the <strong>CSV Input</strong> which is a subset of options from the Text File Input with some performance advantages for delimited files.</p>

<p>With <strong>Text File Input</strong> there are a lot more options available to you for reading the file. You can set the <em>Filetype</em> as CSV and select your separator in the <em>Content</em> tab, and list out the fields you want to grab in the <em>Fields</em> tab. Using this step would solve your problem because in the <em>Additional output fields</em> tab you can specify a field in the stream to put your filename, extension, file path, etc.</p>

<p>The advantages you gain when using the <strong>CSV Input</strong> are:</p>

<ul>
<li>NIO: Native system calls for reading the file means faster performance, but it is limited to only local files currently. No VFS support.</li>
<li>Parallel running: If you configure this step to run in multiple copies or in clustered mode, and you enable parallel running, each copy will read a separate block of a single file allowing you to distribute the file reading to several threads or even several slave nodes in a clustered transformation.</li>
<li>Lazy conversion: If you will be reading many fields from the file and many of those fields will not be manipulate, but merely passed through the transformation to land in some other text file or a database, lazy conversion can prevent Kettle from performing unnecessary work on those fields such as converting them into objects such as strings, dates, or numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you need those advantages then you'll have to get at your file name another way, such as passing it as a named parameter and adding it to the stream with the Get Variables step.</p>

57085350,"<p>This question is similar to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/38136058/6873133"">this</a> question, but not quite. Also, <a href=""https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs#example-code"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's a link</a> to the ConvNetJS example code with comments (<a href=""https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/docs.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here's a link</a> to the full documentation). You can take a look at the code at the top of the demo page for the code itself.</p>

<p>An <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">activation function</a> is a function that takes in some input and outputs some value based on if it reaches some ""threshold"" (this is specific for each different activation function). This comes from how neurons work, where they take some electrical input and will only activate if they reach some threshold.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 1:</strong> The first set of images show the raw input image (the left colored image) and the right of the two images is the output after going through the activation functions. You shouldn't really be able to interpret the second image because it is going through non-linear and perceived random non-linear transformations through the network.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 2:</strong> Similar to the previous point, the ""activations"" are the functions the image pixel information is passed into. A <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">gradient</a> is essentially the slope of the activation function. It appears more sparse (i.e., colors show up in only certain places) because it shows possible areas in the image that each node is focusing on. For example, the 6th image on the first row has some color in the bottom left corner; this may indicate a large change in the activation function to indicate something interesting in this area. This <a href=""https://medium.com/the-theory-of-everything/understanding-activation-functions-in-neural-networks-9491262884e0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">article</a> may clear up some confusion on weights and activation functions. And <a href=""https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/11/intuitive-explanation-convnets/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> has some really great visuals on what each step is doing.</p>

<p><strong>Confusion Point 3:</strong> This confused me at first, because if you think about a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ReLu function</a>, you will see that it has a slope of one for positive <code>x</code> and 0 everywhere else. So to take the gradient (or slope) of the activation function (ReLu in this case) doesn't make sense. The ""max activation"" and ""min activation"" values make sense for a ReLu: the minimum value will be zero and the max is whatever the maximum value is. This is straight from the definition of a ReLu. <s>To explain the gradient values, I suspect that some Gaussian noise and a <a href=""https://github.com/karpathy/convnetjs/blob/4c3358a315b4d71f31a0d532eb5d1700e9e592ee/src/convnet_net.js#L43"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bias term of 0.1</a> has been added to those values.</s> <strong>Edit:</strong> the gradient refers to the slope of the cost-weight curve shown below. The y-axis is the loss value or the calculated error using the weight values <strong>w</strong> on the x-axis.</p>

21428721,"<p>By default Firebird uses a random port for events. This doesn't work well with firewalls, so Firebird also offers an option to use a fixed port, using the <code>RemoteAuxPort</code> setting in <code>firebird.conf</code>. This option was added in Firebird 1.5, see the <a href=""http://www.firebirdsql.org/file/documentation/release_notes/html/rlsnotes15.html#config-fb-conf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Firebird 1.5 release notes</a>. Migrating from Firebird 1.0 to Firebird 1.5 should be relatively easy (migrating to more recent versions like Firebird 2.5 might be more work).</p>
<p>For details look at the section <em>Common Problems: Firewalls</em> in <a href=""http://www.flamerobin.org/events_paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Power of Firebird Events</a> by Milan Babuškov:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The client has a regular connection to Firebird server at its port (3050 by default, but can be changed). When it is registering for events, it sends the request over that connection. The server opens another connection at some random port (4012 for example) and sends that port number to the client. The client then connects to that port.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>When client registers for events, the server opens a random port (ex. 6023) and sends that info to the client. This is where the problem becomes evident: the client tries to connect to that port (6023) on the firewall (as it “sees” the firewall as a server). Since the port is completely random, there are certainly no forwarding rules for that port on the firewall, so connection is denied. Using this setup, there is no way to make it work, short of forwarding all the traffic (all ports) to Firebird server, which is the exact thing we wish to avoid by placing the firewall in front.</p>

This has been fixed for all applications on macOS 10.13. If you are targeting an older OS, it is recommended to use ""variable row heights"" by implementing -tableView:heightOfRow: and returning the desired row height; this will work around the bug with hidden row indexes.</p>
  
  <p>Unhiding rows with the method -unhideRowsAtIndexes:withAnimation: did not work correctly prior to macOS 10.13 when using non-contiguous sets of rows. This has been fixed for all applications on macOS 10.13.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ll notice in the second paragraph that your issue is mentioned.</p>

<p>If you’re developing for an earlier version of macOS, you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>func unhideRows(at indexes: IndexSet, animation: NSTableView.AnimationOptions = []) {
    if #available(macOS 10.13, *) {
        outlineView.unhideRows(
            at: indexes,
            withAnimation: animation
        )
    } else {
        for range in indexes.rangeView {
            outlineView.unhideRows(
                at: IndexSet(integersIn: range),
                withAnimation: animation
            )
        }
    }
}

def myfunc():

    for cuetime in (2,3,4):

        mydata = yield viztask.waitTime( cuetime)

<p>You'll find that the timing mismatch is usually related to your frame rate ( 60 Hz ~ 16.7ms)</p>

<p>Following edit by OP:
.. an easy way to test if the timing differences are due to the frame syncing is to turn off Vertical sync (V-Sync) for your graphics card and re-run it - I suspect you'll get much better timings, however you might get frame tearing on your display  - then it's your call as to what is more important to you, image quality or timing accuracy. 
Another option to prove its todo wit refreshing is simply to change your refresh rate and see if the time differences vary accordingly.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can you explain to me how to access the numbers of the array? I'm trying to print them using this, but it's printing 0 all the time:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>For a simple printing of the array, I'm not sure how this code helps you. Without the context of the surrounding code, it's difficult for me to speculate as to what the code is doing.</p>

<p>It looks like you're trying to do your own equivalent of <code>printf(""%d"",num)</code>, but there is already a syscall to output an integer to the screen. I'd use that. But ... If you truly need to ""roll your own"", I've included code to do that.</p>

<p>Printing the array is similar to the input of the array.</p>

<p>I've reworked the previous example code. The input of the array is now a function. I removed the hardwired limit value of 250 in favor of using a new label: <code>arrend</code> [so, have a look]</p>

<p>Once it was a function, it was a simple matter to copy, paste, and rework it into a new function <code>arrprt</code> that prints the array.</p>

<p>To manually do what syscall 1 does, I've added the <code>prtint</code> function. <code>arrprt</code> will use the syscall, but if you want it to use <code>prtint</code>, comment out the syscall and uncomment the block that calls <code>prtint</code></p>

<p>Here's the new code:</p>

<pre><code>    .data
msg_siz:    .asciiz     ""Introduce size of array: ""
msg_num:    .asciiz     ""Introduce next number: ""
msg_nl:     .asciiz     ""\n""

3949771,"<p>Likely you need to get just the keys from the name_ids hash. Try:</p>

<pre><code>@names = Name.find(params[:name_ids].keys)
</code></pre>

<p>A separate problem is your reference to params[:name], which is nil. Did you mean (EDIT: use to_s to match the params key, lol):</p>

<pre><code>@names.each do |name|
  name.update_attributes!(params[:name_ids][name.id.to_s].reject { |k,v| v.blank? })
end
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT (brief-ish explanation):</p>

<p>What was happening was that you had a nested hash in the params, params[:name_ids]. It looked like:</p>

<pre><code>""name_ids""=&gt;{""7""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""0"", ""what""=&gt;""Партия"", ""which""=&gt;""Крутая""}, ""1""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""1"", ""what""=&gt;""Россия"", ""which""=&gt;""Единая""}, ""4""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""0"", ""what""=&gt;""Организация"", ""which""=&gt;""Молдавская""}}
</code></pre>

<p>An ActiveRecord 'find' method can take an array of ids, but not a hash of values. What you were originally submitting to 'find' in this line:</p>

<pre><code>@names = Name.find(params[:name_ids])
</code></pre>

<p>...was the value for params[:name_ids]: </p>

<pre><code>{""7""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""0"", ""what""=&gt;""Партия"", ""which""=&gt;""Крутая""}, ""1""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""1"", 
""what""=&gt;""Россия"", ""which""=&gt;""Единая""}, ""4""=&gt;{""published""=&gt;""0"", ""what""=&gt;""Организация"", 
""which""=&gt;""Молдавская""}
</code></pre>

<p>When what you wanted was:</p>

<pre><code>@names = Name.find(['7','1','4'])
</code></pre>

<p>which is what calling params[:name_ids].keys gives you. </p>

<p>The second problem was this line:</p>

<pre><code>name.update_attributes!(params[:name].reject { |k,v| v.blank? })
</code></pre>

<p>There was no value ':name' in params, so calling 'reject' on it cause the 'no method' error -- there is no 'reject' method on the nil object. What you wanted was to update the attributes for the 'name' that corresponded to the particular name in the loop. This meant you wanted to get the values out of params[:name_ids][:id] where :id was the id of 'name'. </p>

<p>It all goes back to the way fields_for created the params to begin with. This line:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;% fields_for ""name_ids[#{name.id}]"", name do |name_fields| %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>meant that params would contain a hash called 'name_ids', with keys corresponding to name.id, that themselves would contain hashes of attributes that ActiveRecord could use in the update_attributes method. </p>

18486496,"<p>If you ultimately decide to move the cache outside your main webserver process, then you could also take a look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing"" rel=""nofollow"">consistent hashing</a>. This would be a alternative to a replicated cache.</p>

<p>The problem with replicated caches, is they scale inversely proportional to the number of nodes participating in the cache. i.e. their performance degrades as you add additional nodes. They work fine when there is a small number of nodes. If data is to be replicated between N nodes (or you need to send eviction messages to N nodes), then every write requires 1 write to the cache on the originating node, and N-1 writes to the other nodes.</p>

<p>In consistent hashing, you instead define a hashing function, which takes the key of the data you want to store or retrieve as input, and it returns the id of the server in the cluster which is responsible for caching the data for that key. So each caching server is responsible for a fraction of the overall keys, the client can determine which server will contain the sought data without any lookup, and data and eviction messages do not need to be replicated between caching servers.</p>

<p>The ""consistent"" part of consistent hashing, refers to how your hashing function handles new servers being added to or removed from the cluster: some re-distribution of keys between servers is required, but the function is designed to minimize the amount of such disruption.</p>

<p>In practice, you do not actually need a dedicated caching cluster, as your caches could run in-process in your web servers; each web server being able to determine the other webserver which should store cache data for a key.</p>

<p>Consistent hashing is used at large scale. It might be overkill for you at this stage. But just be aware of the scalability bottleneck inherent in O(N) messaging architectures. A replicated cache is possibly a good idea to <em>start with</em>.</p>

19398077,"<p>You're not doing anything wrong. GTK widgets use reference counting, but in your programme all the references are taken care of, so you're not (manually) leaking anything.</p>

<p>So why does Valgrind claim you are?</p>

<p>Firstly, GLib has its own ""slab"" memory allocator, called <code>GSlice</code>, which is generally faster than system <code>malloc</code> for small allocations. Unfortunately, it confuses Valgrind, but if you set the environment variable <code>G_SLICE=always-malloc</code>, <code>GSlice</code> is effectively turned off.</p>

<p>Secondly, you can set the <code>G_DEBUG=gc-friendly</code>, which is supposed to help Valgrind produce more accurate results (although it my experience it generally doesn't make any difference).</p>

<p>Both of these environment variables are listed in the <a href=""https://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.38/glib-running.html"" rel=""nofollow"">GLib documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, even if you do both of these things, Valgrind will still report that your app leaks memory. The reason for this is that GTK (and its underlying libraries) allocate some ""static"" memory at start-up that doesn't get freed until the programme quits. This isn't really a problem, because typically the programme ends as soon as <code>gtk_main()</code> returns, and then the OS frees any remaining resources, so you're not <em>really</em> leaking anything. Valgrind thinks you are though, and for this reason it would be nice to have a <code>gtk_deinit()</code> function, but sadly there isn't one.</p>

<p>The best you can do instead is to teach Valgrind to ignore these things, via a suppressions file. The <a href=""https://wiki.gnome.org/Valgrind"" rel=""nofollow"">Valgrind page on the Gnome Wiki</a> has details on all this and more.</p>

<p>I tested your code by replacing the Raspberry Pi specific register usage with standard C functions for reading from stdin and printing to <code>stdout</code>.

<p>I mentioned earlier that there are some easier ways for you to reset the pointer. You can actually do it without using <code>nRreset</code>; since the base address for <code>newResBuffer</code> never changes, you can simply reset it with <code>nR = newResBuffer</code>.  </p>

<p>An even easier way to do it would be not to use a moving pointer at all and simply use the variable <code>j</code> you already have in your code to index <code>newResBuffer</code>.  </p>

<p>You can also use <code>atoi()</code> or <code>strtol()</code> instead of <code>sscanf()</code> to convert the string buffer to an <code>int</code> (or <code>long</code>).  </p>

<p>Here's a simpler version of the code which achieves the same thing:  </p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    char newResBuffer[10];
    char rxRead = 0;
    int newRes = 0;
    int newResFlag = 0;
    int j = 0;

    while (1) {
        /* if (U1STAbits.URXDA) { */
        if (rand() % 2) {
            /* rxRead = U1RXREG &amp; 0xFF; */
            rxRead = getc(stdin);
            newResBuffer[j++] = rxRead;

            if (j &gt; 4) {
                newResBuffer[j] = '\0';
                newResFlag = 1;
                j = 0;
            }
        }

        if (newResFlag) {
            newRes = atoi(newResBuffer);
            /* MAXCNT = (newRes * 2) - 1; */
            printf(""newRes: %d\n"", newRes);
            printf(""MAXCNT: %d\n"", (newRes * 2) - 1);
            newResFlag = 0;
        }

I experienced the DnD issue as well, read below for how I worked around it
I did <em>not</em> install the GAPPs zip. It's not needed and causes a lot of crash notifications.</li>
<li>Extract up-to-date Chrome APK from my actual android device. APK's for installed apps can be found in /data/app (but this my require root) or you could use a back-up solution to extract it.</li>
<li>Install the obtained APK by also DnD'ing it into the home screen, it will automatically install.
... And it worked.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the DnD issue, in my case the cause appeared to be that I was running Genymotion 'as administrator' (Why? Complicated: Because I have an unrelated virtualBox machine using a native disk image, which requires me to start virtualbox in privileged mode, which will crash Genymotion if it's not also running in privileged mode). However when I started GenyMotion not 'as admin' the dnd issue did not appear.
If this is not the issue in your case I think you can still get the stuff installed without DnD support:</p>

<ul>
<li>First get the files on your image in some way, use your imagination (or any file sharing web service)</li>
<li>Also get an APK for a decent file explorer with ZIP and root support. I use ES file explorer and my instructions will be based in it. I suggest, as for Chrome itself, to install it on your actual phone first and then grab the APK.</li>
<li>Install the file explorer, start it and become root (ES crashed the first couple of times in my case, but after some tries it worked)</li>
<li>make sure /system is mounted as r/w. in ES, use menu->root explorer->mount R/W, put /system on RW</li>
<li>Locate the Genymotion-ARM-Translation_v1.1.zip, browse into it, select (long press) 'system' folder, extract to, 'choose path', point to /. The Zip will now be 'installed'</li>
<li>Go back to root explorer options, put /system back to RO</li>
<li>Reboot the emulator (in my case it crashed both on shutdown and first boot; I just closed the emulator after a few minutes and tried again. Then it worked)</li>
<li>Now you should be able to install the Chrome APK</li>

  <p>How can I find vulnerabilities in this code?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With experience, a good set of compiler options, a static source code analyzer, a dynamic analyzer, ... anything you know how to use. If you don't know how to use such, I'm afraid that you have to learn.</p>

<p>You can find the worst problems by raising the warning level of your compiler to the max and even give option like <code>-pedantic</code> for GCC. The same applies to the analyzers of which the static kind is quite simple to use.</p>

<p>Then you can build tables of possible control and data flows. For instance <code>scanf()</code> can do anything of these:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read nothing at all into <code>t1</code> leaving it completely uninitialized, perhaps because of I/O errors.</li>
<li>Read a zero length string; just one character, <code>'\0'</code>, will be stored in <code>t1</code>.</li>
<li>Read anything between the previous and the next length.</li>
<li>Read a string filling <code>t1</code> up to the last character, but not overflowing it.</li>
<li>Read a string longer than <code>t1</code> provides space for.</li>
<li>Read a string very much longer than <code>t1</code> provides space for.</li>
</ol>

<p>Some of these might have the same effect, beware. Then think about what will happen further down the control flow.</p>

<p>Do this for every function call, every assignment, and every instruction. Some instructions are simple and don't do any harm, others are quite tricky. You have to read the documentation of the functions carefully, and the C standard, may be more than one version of it.</p>

<p>There are some traps to distract you from the real errors, too.</p>

<p><strong>Suspect #1:</strong> the code jumps straight into an unresolveable live-lock due to a move into ill-directed state of the distributed-Finite-State-Automaton:</p>

<p><strong><code>socket.recv( request, zmq::recv_flags::dontwait ); // socket being == ZMQ_REP</code></strong></p>

going into the <strong><code>.send()</code></strong>-able state is possible <strong>if and only if</strong> a previous <code>.recv()</code>-ed has delivered a real message.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The Best Next Step :</h2>

<p>Review the code and may either use a blocking-form of the <code>.recv()</code> before going to <code>.send()</code> or, better, use a { blocking | non-blocking }-form of <code>.poll( { 0 | timeout }, ZMQ_POLLIN )</code> before entering into an attempt to <code>.recv()</code> and keep doing other things, if there is nothing to receive yet ( so as to avoid the self suicidal throwing the dFSA into an uresolvable collision, flooding your <code>stdout/stderr</code> with a second-spaced flow of <code>printf("" ERROR: %X\n"", e.num() );</code> )</p>

<hr>

<h2>Error Handling :</h2>

<p>Better use <code>const char *zmq_strerror ( int errnum );</code> being fed by <code>int zmq_errno (void);</code></p>

<hr>

<h2>The Problem 1 :</h2>

<p>On the contrary to the suicidal <code>::dontwait</code> flag in the Problem 2 root cause, the Problem 2 root cause is, that a blocking-form of the first <code>.recv()</code> here moves all the worker-threads into an undeterministically long, possibly infinite, waiting-state, as the <code>.recv()</code>-blocks proceeding to any further step until a real message arrives ( which it does not seem from the MCVE, that it ever will ) and so your pool-of-threads remains in a pool-wide blocked-waiting-state and nothing will ever happen until any message arrived.</p>

<h2>Update on how the <code>REQ/REP</code> works :</h2>

<p>The <strong><code>REQ/REP</code></strong> Scalable Communication Pattern Archetype works like a distributed pair of people - one, let's call her Mary, asks ( Mary <code>.send()</code>-s the <strong><code>REQ</code></strong> ), while the other one, say Bob the <strong><code>REP</code></strong> listens in a potentially infinitely long blocking <code>.recv()</code> ( or takes a due care, using <code>.poll()</code> to orderly and regularly check, if Mary has asked about something or not and continues to do his own hobbies or gardening otherwise ) and once the Bob's end gets a message, Bob can go and <code>.send()</code> Mary a reply ( not before, as he knows nothing when and what Mary would ( or would not ) ask in the nearer of farther future ) ) and Mary is fair not to ask her next <code>REQ.send()</code>-question to Bob anytime sooner but after Bob has ( <code>REP.send()</code> ) replied and Mary has received Bob's message ( <code>REQ.recv()</code> ) - which is fair and more symmetric, than a real life may exhibit among real people under one roof :o)</p>

<p>The code?</p>

<p>The code is not a reproducible MCVE. The <code>main()</code> creates five Bobs ( hanging waiting a call from Mary, somewhere over <code>inproc://</code> transport-class ), but no Mary ever calls, or does she? Not visible sign of any Mary trying to do so, the less her ( their, could be a (even a dynamic) community of N:M herd-of-Mary(s):herd-of-5-Bobs relation ) attempt(s) to handle REP-ly(s) coming from either one of the 5-Bobs.</p>

18896395,"<p>Just updating my answer based on what we've found last week and implemented for our app as a solution. </p>

<p>Although not entirely clear I believe the Question in hand above has to do with an HTML application running in webview vs. a web application in safari. Because 2x compatibility mode is being referenced in the question.</p>

<p><strong>Issue:</strong>
Is not due to media Query but the viewport <strong>width=device-width</strong> is returning 768 instead of the 320 it returned in &lt;= iOS6.x, when running an iPhone application in 'Compatibility Mode' on an iPad.</p>

<p><strong>Fixing on the remote page</strong>
The best solution is to edit the viewport on the remote page by modifying the value of the 'width' attribute or removing it all together.</p>

<p><strong>Fixing natively:</strong> 
Few options...
1) Build the app as 'Universal' 
2) I found <em>somewhat passable</em> results by executing javascript on webViewDidFinishLoad to decrease the scale</p>

<pre><code>self.webView stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:@""$('meta[name=viewport]').attr('content','width=device-width, initial-scale=.41 user-scalable=no');""];

38108978,"<p>This implementation is not the Factory because it doesn't create new instances.</p>

<p>It isn't Service Locator either, because it is not locating services - now this requires a few words of explanation.</p>

<p>Service locator should return distinct interfaces. Your method is returning objects implementing a single common interface. Here is the signature of a Service Locator:</p>

<pre><code>T LocateService&lt;T&gt;() { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>This is the dreaded signature which has caused so much troubles to developers worldwide. The problem is that signature of this method doesn't tell what is the kind of objects the consumer may depend on. Let me show it with a longer example:</p>

<pre><code>class ServiceLocator {
    T Locate&lt;T&gt;();
}

class Golum {

    ServiceLocator locator;

    Consumer(ServiceLocator depedency) { ... }

    void beNice() {
        Preciousss myPrecious = this.locator.Locate&lt;Previousss&gt;();
        myPrecious.DoMagic();
    }
}

void main() {
    new Golum(new ServiceLocator()).beNice(); // Fails!
}
</code></pre>

<p>This piece of code is the sublimation of all evil that comes with misuse of service locators. Main function is initializing the Golum class, but it has no clue what Golum requires. Golum just asks for a service locator, any service locator, and then gets going. When beNice method is invoked, it turns that particular service locator object that was passed has no knowledge of the Preciousss class at all, and then call to Locate fails.</p>

You can use the <code>String.Split</code> method passing in your <code>""|""c</code> parameter. The c tells the compiler that this is a <code>Char</code> not a string because <code>.Split</code> is expecting a <code>Char</code> Now you can use the <code>.Add</code> method to add the sections to the appropriate list.</p>

<p>After the loop, you can assign the 3 list to the <code>.DataSource</code> property of the appropriate <code>ListBox</code>.</p>
